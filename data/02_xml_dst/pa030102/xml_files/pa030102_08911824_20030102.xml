<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to immunoassays for the detection and differentiation of antibodies to Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) Group M, HIV-1 Group O and Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 2 (HIV-2). More particularly, the invention relates to novel antigen constructs useful as reagents in such assays, as well as polynucleotides, DNA clones, expression vectors, transformed host cells and the like which are useful in the preparation of such antigens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Detection of HIV infection in a patient, and characterization of the viral type, are typically carried out using immunoassays which rely on the highly specific interaction between antigens used as reagents in the assay and circulating antibodies in the patient&apos;s serum. The immunoreactivity of patient antibodies with some antigens, and to a lesser extent or not at all with others, permits the identification of the type and subtype of the HIV which is present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Currently, there are two major phylogenetic groups of HIV-1 designated as Groups &ldquo;M&rdquo; and &ldquo;O.&rdquo;G. Meyers et al., <highlight><italic>Human Retroviruses and AIDS </italic></highlight>1995, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, N. Mex. (1995). HIV-1 Group M isolates further have been divided into subgroups (A to J) that are phylogenetically approximately equidistant from each other. Group M isolates predominate worldwide. The earliest reports about the sequence of HIV-1 Group O indicated that these viruses were as closely related to a chimpanzee virus as to other HIV-1 subgroups. See, for example, L. G. G&uuml;rtler et al., <highlight><italic>J. Virology </italic></highlight>68:1581-1585 (1994); M. Vanden Haesevelde et al., <highlight><italic>J. Virology </italic></highlight>68:1586-1596 (1994); De Leys et al., <highlight><italic>J. Virology </italic></highlight>64:1207-1216 (1990); DeLeys et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,304,466; L .G . G&uuml;rtler et al., European Patent Publication No. 591914 A2. The Group O sequences are the most divergent of the HIV-1 sequences described to date. Although HIV-1 Group O strains are endemic to west central Africa (Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria and Gabon), patients infected with Group O isolates now have been identified in Belgium, France, Germany, Spain and the United States. See, for example, R. DeLeys et al., supra; P. Chameau et al., <highlight><italic>Virology </italic></highlight>30 205:247-253 (1994); I. Loussert-Ajaka et al., <highlight><italic>J. Virology </italic></highlight>69:5640-5649 (1995); H. Hampl et al., <highlight><italic>Infection </italic></highlight>23:369-370 (1995); A. Mas et al., <highlight><italic>AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses </italic></highlight>12:1647-1649 (1996); M. Peters et al., <highlight><italic>AIDS </italic></highlight>11:493-498 (1997); and M. A. Rayfield et al., <highlight><italic>Emerging Infectious Diseases </italic></highlight>2:209-212 (1996). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> HIV-1 Group M serology is characterized in large part by the amino acid sequences of the expressed viral proteins (antigens), particularly those comprising the core and envelope (env) regions. As between various strains of this rapidly-mutating virus, these antigens are structurally and functionally similar but have divergent amino acid sequences which elicit antibodies that are similar but not identical in their specificity for a particular antigen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One of the key serological targets for detection of HIV-1 infection is the 41,000 MW transmembrane protein (TMP), glycoprotein 41 (gp41). gp41 is a highly immunogenic protein which elicits a strong and sustained antibody response in individuals considered seropositive for HIV. Antibodies to this protein are among the first to appear at seroconversion. The immune response to gp41 apparently remains relatively strong throughout the course of the disease, as evidenced by the near universal presence of anti-gp41 antibodies in asymptomatic patients as well as those exhibiting clinical stages of AIDS. A significant proportion of the antibody response to gp41 is directed toward a well-characterized immunodominant region (IDR) within gp41. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Infections with HIV Type 2 (HIV-2), a virus initially found in individuals from Africa, now have been identified in humans outside of the initial endemic area of West Africa, and have been reported in Europeans who have lived in West Africa or those who have had sexual relations with individuals from this region. See, for example, A. G. Saimot et al., <highlight><italic>Lanceti:</italic></highlight>688 (1987); M. A. Rey et al.,<highlight><italic>Lanceti:</italic></highlight>388-389 (1987); A. Werner et al.,<highlight><italic>Lanceti:</italic></highlight>868-869 (1987); G. Brucker et al., <highlight><italic>Lancet i:</italic></highlight>223 (1987); K. Marquart et al., <highlight><italic>AIDS </italic></highlight>2:141 (1988); CDC, MMWR 37:33-35 (1987); Anonymous, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>332:295 (1988). Cases of AIDS due to HIV-2 have been documented world-wide. Serologic studies indicate that while HIV-1 and HIV-2 share multiple common epitopes in their core antigens, the envelope glycoproteins of these two viruses are much less cross-reactive. F. Clavel, <highlight><italic>AIDS </italic></highlight>1:135-140 (1987). This limited cross-reactivity of the envelope antigens is believed to explain why currently available serologic assays for HIV-1 may fail to react with certain sera from individuals with antibody to HIV-2. F. Denis et al., <highlight><italic>J. Clin. Micro. </italic></highlight>26:1000-1004 (1988). Recently-issued U.S. Pat. No. 5,055,391 maps the HIV-2 genome and provides assays to detect the virus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> These viral strains are, for the most part, readily identified and characterized using commercially-available diagnostic tests. However, concerns have arisen regarding the capability of currently-available immunoassays, designed for the detection of antibody to HIV-1 (Group M) and/or HIV-2, to detect the presence of antibody to HIV-1 Group O. I. Loussert-Ajaka et al., <highlight><italic>Lancet </italic></highlight>343:1393-1394 (1994); C. A. Schable et al., <highlight><italic>Lancet </italic></highlight>344:1333-1334 (1994); L. G&uuml;rtler et al., <highlight><italic>J. Virol. Methods </italic></highlight>51:177-184 (1995). Although, to date, few patients outside of west Central Africa have been found to be infected with HIV-1 Group O isolates, health officials fear the emergence of this subtype in other geographic areas as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Consequently, there is a continued need for new antigens, suitable for use in immunoassays, which alone or in conjunction with other antigens permit the recognition of all HIV-1 (Group M and Group O ) and HIV-2 isolates and/or infections. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It has now been found that certain polypeptides or combinations of are particularly useful in the detection of HIV-1 Group O and other HIV infections. Consequently, in a first aspect of the present invention is disclosed an isolated HIV-1 Group O env polypeptide having an amino acid sequence consisting essentially of the sequence of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO:61), representing the full-length env region of the HIV-1 Group O isolate HAM112. Similarly disclosed is an isolated HIV-1 Group O env polypeptide comprising an immunoreactive portion of the above full-length polypeptide, as well as polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect of the present invention, an antigen construct is disclosed which comprises a first HIV-1 Group O env polypeptide fused to a second HIV-1 Group O env polypeptide. Preferably, the first polypeptide of such an antigen construct is a gp120 polypeptide and the second polypeptide is a gp41 polypeptide, optionally with a portion of the hydrophobic region of the gp41 polypeptide being deleted so as to facilitate expression when expressed as a recombinant product. Also preferred among the above antigen constructs are those in which at least one of the first and second HIV-1 Group O env polypeptides is derived from HIV-1 Group O isolate HAM112, as are those in which the first polypeptide comprises an immunoreactive portion of the gp120 protein of HIV-1 Group O isolate HAM112. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the above Group O env constructs, the first polypeptide may have an amino acid sequence which consists essentially of residues 1 through 520 of the sequence shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO:61), or alternatively an immunoreactive portion thereof. A shortened and preferred first polypeptide is one having an amino acid sequence consisting essentially of residues 476 through 520 of the sequence of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO:61). Along with any of the above polypeptides, the second polypeptide used in the constructs of the invention may be an immunoreactive portion of the gp41 protein of HIV-1 Group O isolate HAM112, from which a portion of the hydrophobic region of the gp41 protein of HIV-1 Group O isolate HAM112 is optionally absent. In particular, the deleted portion may be that part of gp41 which has an amino acid sequence consisting essentially of residues 690 through 715 of the sequence of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO:61). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The above second polypeptide will preferably have an amino acid sequence consisting essentially of residues 521 through 873 of the sequence of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO:61) or a portion thereof. More preferably, the second polypeptide may have an amino acid sequence consisting essentially of residues 47 through 373 of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO:52); still more preferably, the amino acid sequence may consist essentially of residues 47 through 245 of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO:48); and even more preferably, the amino acid sequence may consist essentially of residues 47 through 215 of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO:58). Representative of the Group O env constructs of the invention are constructs pGO-8PL, pGO-8CKS, pGO-9PL, pGO-9CKS, pGO-11lPL and pGO-11CKS, as well as any derivatives, variants and analogs thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect of the present invention, there is disclosed an antigen construct comprising a fusion of at least one HIV-1 Group O env polypeptide with at least one HIV-1 Group M env polypeptide, and more preferably an antigen construct comprising a fusion of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> (a) a first HIV-1 Group O env polypeptide; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> (b) a second HIV-1 Group O env polypeptide; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> (c) a first HIV-1 Group M env polypeptide; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> (d) a second HIV-1 Group M env polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The HIV-1 Group M polypeptides in the above constructs may be derived from an HIV-1 isolate of Subtype B, and preferably at least one is derived from HIV-1 Group M isolate HXB2R. In any of these Group O/Group M env constructs, at least one of the HIV-1 Group O sequences may be derived from HIV-1 Group O isolate HAM112. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the first Group O env polypeptide and the first Group M env polypeptide may both be gp120 polypeptides, while the second Group O env polypeptide and the second Group M env polypeptide may both be gp41 polypeptides. To enhance expression, a portion of the hydrophobic region of at least one of the gp41 polypeptides may be deleted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Antigen constructs included among the above are those in which: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> (a) the first HIV-1 Group O env polypeptide comprises an immunoreactive portion of the gp120 protein of HIV-1 Group O isolate HAM112; </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of an isolated polypeptide of the present invention, the amino acid sequence of the env protein of the HIV-1 Group O isolate HAM112 is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO:61). In the present context, &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; is intended to mean that such polypeptides are relatively purified with respect to other viral or cellular components which normally would be present in situ, up to and including a substantially pure preparation of the protein. Such polypeptides can be utilized as assay reagents, for the production of monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies, in the manufacture of vaccines, or otherwise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Immunoreactive portions, or fragments, of the above polypeptides are also expected to be useful. By &ldquo;immunoreactive&rdquo; is meant portions of such length as are capable of eliciting an immune response in a host and/or of reacting with antibodies directed specifically thereto; preferably, such partial polypeptides will be five or more amino acids in length. It should also be noted that the term &ldquo;portion&rdquo; as used herein is directed to both terminally truncated sequences and those which are shortened by the removal of an intervening sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The above polypeptides and portions will best be produced by expression of polynucleotides encoding the same. These too permit a degree of variability in their sequence, as for example due to degeneracy of the genetic code, codon bias in favor of the host cell expressing the polypeptide, and conservative amino acid substitutions in the resulting protein. Moreover, it is anticipated that some variation of sequences will occur between &mdash;and possibly even within &mdash;a given HIV-1 isolate or other phylogenetic unit. Consequently, the polypeptides and constructs of the invention include not only those which are identical in sequence to the above sequence but also those which have an amino acid sequence that consist essentially of that reference sequence, where the term &ldquo;consisting essentially&rdquo; is meant to embrace variant polypeptides the structural and functional characteristics of which remain substantially the same. Preferably, such variants (or &ldquo;analogs&rdquo;) will have a sequence homology (&ldquo;identity&rdquo;) of 80% or more with the reference sequence of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this sense, techniques for determining amino acid sequence &ldquo;similarity&rdquo; are well-known in the art. In general, &ldquo;similarity&rdquo; means the exact amino acid to amino acid comparison of two or more polypeptides at the appropriate place, where amino acids are identical or possess similar chemical and/or physical properties such as charge or hydrophobicity. A so-termed &ldquo;percent similarity&rdquo; then can be determined between the compared polypeptide sequences. Techniques for determining nucleic acid and amino acid sequence identity also are well known in the art and include determining the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA for that gene (usually via a cDNA intermediate) and determining the amino acid sequence encoded therein, and comparing this to a second amino acid sequence. In general, &ldquo;identity&rdquo; refers to an exact nucleotide to nucleotide or amino acid to amino acid correspondence of two polynucleotides or polypeptide sequences, respectively. Two or more polynucleotide sequences can be compared by determining their &ldquo;percent identity&rdquo;, as can two or more amino acid sequences. The programs available in the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (available from Genetics Computer Group, Madison, Wis.), for example, the GAP program, are capable of calculating both the identity between two polynucleotides and the identity and similarity between two polypeptide sequences, respectively. Other programs for calculating identity or similarity between sequences are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of the invention, antigen constructs are provided which are suitable for use in the detection of anti-HIV-1 antibodies. As described in greater detail below, such constructs may be prepared by recombinant means, as synthetic peptides, or otherwise; moreover, they may be glycosylated or unglycosylated depending on the manner and/or host cell by which they are made. Consequently, although referred to as if comprising glycoproteins (for example, &ldquo;a gp120 polypeptide&rdquo;), the antigen constructs of the invention are intended to include those which are expressed in bacterial hosts such as <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and are therefore unglycosylated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the above constructs are fusions of various sequences, that is, the constructs are formed by joining various epitope-containing sequences, as for example by co-expression, ligation or sequential synthesis. Also joined thereto, and optionally included in the constructs of the invention, are other polypeptide sequences such as expression (CKS) polylinkers and other linker sequences. The order of the various polypeptide sequences is not critical; consequently, the polypeptides and their epitopes may be re-arranged as a matter of convenience. Further modifications are also possible, as for example by random mutation or site-directed mutagenesis or even the deletion (removal or omission) of certain regions such as the gp41 hydrophobic region, the absence of which has been found to enhance expression of the remaining polypeptide. In any case, whether nearly the same or substantially changed, polypeptides which undergo these modifications may be said to be &ldquo;derived&rdquo; from their respective sources, and the resulting polypeptides may be regarded as &ldquo;derivatives&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the present invention, assay methods are provided which utilize the constructs of the invention in the detection of anti-HIV-1 antibodies in test samples. Such methods permit the direct testing of biological specimens; however, the assay methods may also be modified to permit the testing of pre-processed specimens such as sera, lysed cells, and extracts or preparations made therefrom (as by concentration, dilution, separation, fixation and/or immobilization). Depending on the desired assay format, the antigen constructs may also be modified for use in such assays, as for example by labeling, immobilization on a solid phase or otherwise, or conjugation to other assay reagents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Certain terms used herein are intended to have specialized meanings. Unless otherwise stated, the terms below shall have the following meanings: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;primer&rdquo; denotes a specific oligonucleotide sequence complementary to a target nucleotide sequence and used to hybridize to the target nucleotide sequence. It serves as an initiation point for nucleotide polymerization catalyzed by either DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase or reverse transcriptase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;polynucleotide&rdquo; as used herein means a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, either ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides. This term refers only to the primary structure of the molecule. Thus, the term includes double- and single-stranded DNA as well as double- and single-stranded RNA. It also includes modifications, such as methlylation or capping, and unmodified forms of the polynucleotide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Encoded by&rdquo; refers to a nucleic acid sequence which codes for a polypeptide sequence. Also encompassed are polypeptide sequences which are immnunologically identifiable with a polypeptide encoded by the sequence. Thus, a &ldquo;polypeptide,&rdquo; &ldquo;protein,&rdquo; or &ldquo;amino acid&rdquo; sequence as claimed herein may have at least 60% similarity, more preferably at least about 70% similarity, and most preferably about 80% similarity to a particular polypeptide or amino acid sequence specified below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;recombinant polypeptide&rdquo; or &ldquo;recombinant protein&rdquo;, used interchangeably herein, describe a polypeptide which by virtue of its origin or manipulation is not associated with all or a portion of the polypeptide with which it is associated in nature and/or is linked to a polypeptide other than that to which it is linked in nature. A recombinant or encoded polypeptide or protein is not necessarily translated from a designated nucleic acid sequence. It also may be generated in any manner, including chemical synthesis or expression of a recombinant expression system. &ldquo;Polypeptide&rdquo; and &ldquo;protein&rdquo; are used interchangeably herein and indicate a molecular chain of amino acids linked through covalent and/or noncovalent bonds. The terms do not refer to a specific length of the product. Thus, peptides, oligopeptides and proteins are included within the definition of polypeptide. The terms include post-expression modifications of the polypeptide, for example, glycosylations, acetylations, phosphorylations and the like. In addition, protein fragments, analogs, mutated or variant proteins, fusion proteins and the like are included within the meaning of polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;fragment&rdquo; of a specified polypeptide refers to an amino acid sequence which comprises at least about 3-5 amino acids, more preferably at least about 8-10 amino acids, and even more preferably at least about 15-20 amino acids, derived from the specified polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;synthetic peptide&rdquo; as used herein means a polymeric form of amino acids of any length, which may be chemically synthesized by methods well-known to those skilled in the art. These synthetic peptides are useful in various applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Purified polypeptide&rdquo; means a polypeptide of interest or fragment thereof which is essentially free, that is, contains less than about 50%, preferably less than about 70%, and more preferably, less than about 90% of cellular components with which the polypeptide of interest is naturally associated. Methods for purifying are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; means that the material is removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring). For example, a naturally-occurring polynucleotide or polypeptide present in a living animal is not isolated, but the same polynucleotide or DNA or polypeptide, which is separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system, is isolated. Such polynucleotide could be part of a vector and/or such polynucleotide or polypeptide could be part of a composition, and still be isolated in that the vector or composition is not part of its natural environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Recombinant host cells,&rdquo; &ldquo;host cells,&rdquo; &ldquo;cells,&rdquo; &ldquo;cell lines,&rdquo; &ldquo;cell cultures,&rdquo; and other such terms denoting microorganisms or higher eukaryotic cell lines cultured as unicellular entities refer to cells which can be, or have been, used as recipients for recombinant vector or other transferred DNA, and include the original progeny of the original cell which has been transfected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As used herein &ldquo;replicon&rdquo; means any genetic element, such as a plasmid, a chromosome or a virus, that behaves as an autonomous unit of polynucleotide replication within a cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;vector&rdquo; is a replicon to which another polynucleotide segment is attached, such as to bring about the replication and/or expression of the attached segment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;control sequence&rdquo; refers to polynucleotide sequences which are necessary to effect the expression of coding sequences to which they are ligated. The nature of such control sequences differs depending upon the host organism. In prokaryotes, such control sequences generally include promoter, ribosomal binding site and terminators; in eukaryotes, such control sequences generally include promoters, terminators and, in some instances, enhancers. The term &ldquo;control sequence&rdquo; thus is intended to include at a minimum all components whose presence is necessary for expression, and also may include additional components whose presence is advantageous, for example, leader sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Operably linked&rdquo; refers to a situation wherein the components described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. Thus, for example, a control sequence &ldquo;operably linked&rdquo; to a coding sequence is ligated in such a manner that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the control sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;coding sequence&rdquo; is a polynucleotide sequence which is transcribed into mRNA and translated into a polypeptide when placed under the control of appropriate regulatory sequences. The boundaries of the coding sequence are determined by and include a translation start codon at the 5&prime;-terminus and one or more translation stop codons at the 3&prime;-terminus. A coding sequence can include, but is not limited to, mRNA, cDNA, and recombinant polynucleotide sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;immunologically identifiable with/as&rdquo; refers to the presence of epitope(s) and polypeptide(s) which also are present in and are unique to the designated polypeptide(s). Immunological identity may be determined by antibody binding and/or competition in binding. These techniques are known to the skilled artisan and also are described herein. The uniqueness of an epitope also can be determined by computer searches of known data banks, such as GenBank, for the polynucleotide sequences which encode the epitope, and by amino acid sequence comparisons with other known proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;epitope&rdquo; means an antigenic determinant of a polypeptide. Conceivably, an epitope can comprise three amino acids in a spatial conformation which is unique to the epitope. Generally, an epitope consists of at least five such amino acids, and more usually, it consists of at least eight to ten amino acids. Methods of examining spatial conformation are known in the art and include, for example, x-ray crystallography and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;conformational epitope&rdquo; is an epitope that is comprised of specific juxtaposition of amino acids in an immunologically recognizable structure, such amino acids being present on the same polypeptide in a contiguous or non-contiguous order or present on different polypeptides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> A polypeptide is &ldquo;immunologically reactive&rdquo; with an antibody when it binds to an antibody due to antibody recognition of a specific epitope contained within the polypeptide. Immunological reactivity may be determined by antibody binding, more particularly by the kinetics of antibody binding, and/or by competition in binding using as competitor(s) a known polypeptide(s) containing an epitope against which the antibody is directed. The methods for determining whether a polypeptide is immunologically reactive with an antibody are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;transformation&rdquo; refers to the insertion of an exogenous polynucleotide into a host cell, irrespective of the method used for the insertion. For example, direct uptake, transduction or f-mating are included. The exogenous polynucleotide may be maintained as a non-integrated vector, for example, a plasmid, or alternatively, may be integrated into the host genome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;test sample&rdquo; refers to a component of an individual&apos;s body which is the source of the analyte (such as, antibodies of interest or antigens of interest). These components are well known in the art. These test samples include biological samples which can be tested by the methods of the present invention described herein and include human and animal body fluids such as whole blood, serum, plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, lymph fluids, and various external secretions of the respiratory, intestinal and genitorurinary tracts, tears, saliva, milk, white blood cells, myelomas and the like; biological fluids such as cell culture supernatants; fixed tissue specimens; and fixed cell specimens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Purified product&rdquo; refers to a preparation of the product which has been isolated from the cellular constituents with which the product is normally associated, and from other types of cells which may be present in the sample of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides assays which utilize specific binding members. A &ldquo;specific binding member,&rdquo; as used herein, is a member of a specific binding pair. That is, two different molecules where one of the molecules through chemical or physical means specifically binds to the second molecule. Therefore, in addition to antigen and antibody specific binding pairs of common immunoassays, other specific binding pairs can include biotin and avidin, carbohydrates and lectins, complementary nucleotide sequences, effector and receptor molecules, cofactors and enzymes, enzyme inhibitors and enzymes, and the like. Furthermore, specific binding pairs can include members that are analogs of the original specific binding members, for example, an analyte-analog. Immunoreactive specific binding members include antigens, antigen fragments, antibodies and antibody fragments, both monoclonal and polyclonal, and complexes thereof, including those formed by recombinant DNA molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;capture reagent,&rdquo; as used herein, refers to an unlabeled specific binding member which is specific either for the analyte as in a sandwich assay, for the indicator reagent or analyte as in a competitive assay, or for an ancillary specific binding member, which itself is specific for the analyte, as in an indirect assay. The capture reagent can be directly or indirectly bound to a solid phase material before the performance of the assay or during the performance of the assay, thereby enabling the separation of immobilized complexes from the test sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;indicator reagent&rdquo; comprises a &ldquo;signal-generating compound&rdquo; (&ldquo;label&rdquo;) which is capable of generating and generates a measurable signal detectable by external means, conjugated (&ldquo;attached&rdquo;) to a specific binding member. &ldquo;Specific binding member&rdquo; as used herein means a member of a specific binding pair. That is, two different molecules where one of the molecules through chemical or physical means specifically binds to the second molecule. In addition to being an antibody member of a specific binding pair, the indicator reagent also can be a member of any specific binding pair, including either hapten-anti-hapten systems such as biotin or anti-biotin, avidin or biotin, a carbohydrate or a lectin, a complementary nucleotide sequence, an effector or a receptor molecule, an enzyme cofactor and an enzyme, an enzyme inhibitor or an enzyme, and the like. An immunoreactive specific binding member can be an antibody, an antigen, or an antibody/antigen complex that is capable of binding either to polypeptide of interest as in a sandwich assay, to the capture reagent as in a competitive assay, or to the ancillary specific binding member as in an indirect assay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The various &ldquo;signal-generating compounds&rdquo; (labels) contemplated include chromogens, catalysts such as enzymes, luminescent compounds such as fluorescein and rhodamine, chemiluminescent compounds such as dioxetanes, acridiniums, phenanthridiniums and luminol, radioactive elements, and direct visual labels. Examples of enzymes include alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase, beta-galactosidase, and the like. The selection of a particular label is not critical, but it will be capable of producing a signal either by itself or in conjunction with one or more additional substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Solid phases&rdquo; (&ldquo;solid supports&rdquo;) are known to those in the art and include the walls of wells of a reaction tray, test tubes, polystyrene beads, magnetic beads, nitrocellulose strips, membranes, microparticles such as latex particles, sheep (or other animal) red blood cells, and Duracytes&reg; (red blood cells &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; by pyruvic aldehyde and formaldehyde, available from Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill.) and others. The &ldquo;solid phase&rdquo; is not critical and can be selected by one skilled in the art. Thus, latex particles, microparticles, magnetic or non-magnetic beads, membranes, plastic tubes, walls of microtiter wells, glass or silicon chips, sheep (or other suitable animal&apos;s) red blood cells and Duracytes&reg; are all suitable examples. Suitable methods for immobilizing peptides on solid phases include ionic, hydrophobic, covalent interactions and the like. A &ldquo;solid phase&rdquo;, as used herein, refers to any material which is insoluble, or can be made insoluble by a subsequent reaction. The solid phase can be chosen for its intrinsic ability to attract and immobilize the capture reagent. Alternatively, the solid phase can retain an additional receptor which has the ability to attract and immobilize the capture reagent. The additional receptor can include a charged substance that is oppositely charged with respect to the capture reagent itself or to a charged substance conjugated to the capture reagent. As yet another alternative, the receptor molecule can be any specific binding member which is immobilized upon (attached to) the solid phase and which has the ability to immobilize the capture reagent through a specific binding reaction. The receptor molecule enables the indirect binding of the capture reagent to a solid phase material before the performance of the assay or during the performance of the assay. The solid phase thus can be a plastic, derivatized plastic, magnetic or non-magnetic metal, glass or silicon surface of a test tube, microtiter well, sheet, bead, microparticle, chip, sheep (or other suitable animal&apos;s) red blood cells, Duracytes&reg; and other configurations known to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated and within the scope of the present invention that the solid phase also can comprise any suitable porous material with sufficient porosity to allow access by detection antibodies and a suitable surface affinity to bind antigens. Microporous structure generally are preferred, but materials with gel structure in the hydrated state may be used as well. Such useful solid supports include but are not limited to nitrocellulose and nylon. It is contemplated that such porous solid supports described herein preferably are in the form of sheets of thickness from about 0.01 to 0.5 mm, preferably about 0.1 mm. The pore size may vary within wide limits, and preferably is from about 0.025 to 15 microns, especially from about 0.15 to 15 microns. The surface of such supports may be activated by chemical processes which cause covalent linkage of the antigen or antibody to the support. The irreversible binding of the antigen or antibody is obtained, however, in general, by adsorption on the porous material by poorly understood hydrophobic forces. Other suitable solid supports are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides polynucleotide sequences derived from human immunodeficiency viruses of interest and polypeptides encoded thereby. The polynucleotide(s) may be in the form of mRNA or DNA. Polynucleotides in the form of DNA, cDNA, genomic DNA, and synthetic DNA are within the scope of the present invention. The DNA may be double-stranded or single-stranded, and if single stranded may be the coding (sense) strand or non-coding (anti-sense) strand. The coding sequence which encodes the polypeptide may be identical to the coding sequence provided herein or may be a different coding sequence which coding sequence, as a result of the redundancy or degeneracy of the genetic code, encodes the same polypeptide as the DNA provided herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> This polynucleotide may include only the coding sequence for the polypeptide, or the coding sequence for the polypeptide and additional coding sequence such as a leader or secretory sequence or a proprotein sequence, or the coding sequence for the polypeptide (and optionally additional coding sequence) and non-coding sequence, such as a non-coding sequence 5&prime; and/or 3&prime; of the coding sequence for the polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In addition, the invention includes variant polynucleotides containing modifications such as polynucleotide deletions, substitutions or additions; and any polypeptide modification resulting from the variant polynucleotide sequence. A polynucleotide of the present invention also may have a coding sequence which is a naturally-occurring variant of the coding sequence provided herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In addition, the coding sequence for the polypeptide may be fused in the same reading frame to a polynucleotide sequence which aids in expression and secretion of a polypeptide from a host cell, for example, a leader sequence which functions as a secretory sequence for controlling transport of a polypeptide from the cell. The polypeptide having a leader sequence is a preprotein and may have the leader sequence cleaved by the host cell to form the form of the polypeptide. The polynucleotides may also encode for a proprotein which is the protein plus additional 5&prime; amino acid residues. A protein having a prosequence is a proprotein and may in some cases be an inactive form of the protein. Once the prosequence is cleaved an active protein remains. Thus, the polynucleotide of the present invention may encode for a protein, or for a protein having a prosequence or for a protein having both a presequence (leader sequence) and a prosequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotides of the present invention may also have the coding sequence fused in frame to a marker sequence which allows for purification of the polypeptide of the present invention. The marker sequence may be a hexa-histidine tag supplied by a pQE-9 vector to provide for purification of the polypeptide fused to the marker in the case of a bacterial host, or, for example, the marker sequence may be a hemagglutinin (HA) tag when a mammalian host, e.g. COS-7 cells, is used. The HA tag corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein. See, for example, I. Wilson et al., <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>37:767 (1984). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The present invention further relates to HIV-1 polypeptides which have the deduced amino acid sequence as provided herein, as well as fragments, analogs and derivatives of such polypeptides. The polypeptides of the present invention may be recombinant polypeptides, natural purified polypeptides or synthetic polypeptides. The fragment, derivative or analog of such a polypeptide may be one in which one or more of the amino acid residues is substituted with a conserved or non-conserved amino acid residue (preferably a conserved amino acid residue) and such substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code; or it may be one in which one or more of the amino acid residues includes a substituent group; or it may be one in which the polypeptide is fused with another compound, such as a compound to increase the half-life of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol); or it may be one in which the additional amino acids are fused to the polypeptide, such as a leader or secretory sequence or a sequence which is employed for purification of the polypeptide or a proprotein sequence. Such fragments, derivatives and analogs are within the scope of the present invention. The polypeptides and polynucleotides of the present invention are preferably provided in an isolated form, and preferably purified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Thus, a polypeptide of the present invention may have an amino acid sequence that is identical to that of the naturally-occurring polypeptide or that is different by minor variations due to one or more amino acid substitutions. The variation may be a &ldquo;conservative change&rdquo; typically in the range of about 1 to 5 amino acids, wherein the substituted amino acid has similar structural or chemical properties, e.g., replacement of leucine with isoleucine or threonine with serine. In contrast, variations may include nonconservative changes, e.g., replacement of a glycine with a tryptophan. Similar minor variations may also include amino acid deletions or insertions, or both. Guidance in determining which and how many amino acid residues may be substituted, inserted or deleted without changing biological or immunological activity may be found using computer programs well known in the art, for example, DNASTAR software (DNASTAR Inc., Madison Wis.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The recombinant polypeptides of the present invention can be produced not only as demonstrated below, but also according to a number of alternative methods and using a variety of host cells and expression vectors. Host cells are genetically engineered (transduced or transformed or transfected) with the vectors of this invention which may be a cloning vector or an expression vector. The vector may be in the form of a plasmid, a viral particle, a phage, etc. The engineered host cells can be cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for activating promoters, selecting transformants or amplifying HIV-derived genes. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotides of the present invention may be employed for producing a polypeptide by recombinant techniques. Thus, the polynucleotide sequence may be included in any one of a variety of expression vehicles, in particular vectors or plasmids for expressing a polypeptide. Such vectors include chromosomal, nonchromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences, e.g., derivatives of SV40; bacterial plasmids; phage DNA; yeast plasmids; vectors derived from combinations of plasmids and phage DNA, viral DNA such as vaccinia, adenovirus, fowl pox virus, and pseudorabies. However, any other plasmid or vector may be used so long as it is replicable and viable in the host. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The appropriate DNA sequence may be inserted into the vector by a variety of procedures. In general, the DNA sequence is inserted into appropriate restriction endonuclease sites by procedures known in the art. Such procedures and others are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art. The DNA sequence in the expression vector is operatively linked to an appropriate expression control sequence(s) (promoter) to direct mRNA synthesis. Representative examples of such promoters include but are not limited to LTR or SV40 promoter, the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>lac or trp, the phage lambda P sub L promoter and other promoters known to control expression of genes in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells or their viruses. The expression vector also contains a ribosome binding site for translation initiation and a transcription terminator. The vector may also include appropriate sequences for amplifying expression. In addition, the expression vectors preferably contain a gene to provide a phenotypic trait for selection of transformed host cells such as dihydrofolate reductase or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture, or such as tetracycline or ampicillin resistance in <highlight><italic>E. coli. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The vector containing the appropriate DNA sequence as hereinabove described, as well as an appropriate promoter or control sequence, may be employed to transform an appropriate host to permit the host to express the protein. As representative examples of appropriate hosts, there may be mentioned: bacterial cells, such as <highlight><italic>E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium</italic></highlight>; Streptomyces sp.; fungal cells, such as yeast; insect cells such as Drosophila and Sf9; animal cells such as chinese hamster ovary (CHO), COS or Bowes melanoma; plant cells, etc. The selection of an appropriate host is deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings provided herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the present invention also includes recombinant constructs comprising one or more of the sequences as broadly described above. The constructs comprise a vector, such as a plasmid or viral vector, into which a sequence of the invention has been inserted, in a forward or reverse orientation. In a preferred aspect of this embodiment, the construct further comprises regulatory sequences, including, for example, a promoter, operably linked to the sequence. Large numbers of suitable vectors and promoters are known to those of skill in the art, and are commercially available. The following vectors are provided by way of example. Bacterial: pINCY (Incyte Pharmaceuticals Inc., Palo Alto, Calif.), pSPORTl (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.), pQE70, pQE60, pQE-9 (Qiagen) pBs, phagescript, psiX174, pBluescript SK, pBsKS, pNH8a, pNH16a, pNH18a, pNH46a (Stratagene); pTrc99A, pKK223-3, pKK233-3, pDR540, pRIT5 (Pharmacia). Eukaryotic: pWLneo, pSV2cat, pOG44, pXT1, pSG (Stratagene) pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG, pSVL (Pharmacia). However, any other plasmid or vector may be used as long as it is replicable and viable in the host. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Promoter regions can be selected from any desired gene using CAT (chloramphenicol transferase) vectors or other vectors with selectable markers. Two appropriate vectors are pKK232-8 and pCM7. Particular named bacterial promoters include lacI, lacZ, T3, SP6, T7, gpt, lambda P sub R, P sub L and trp. Eukaryotic promoters include cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early, herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase, early and late SV40, LTRs from retrovirus, and mouse metallothionein-I. Selection of the appropriate vector and promoter is well within the level of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The host cell used herein can be a higher eukaryotic cell, such as a mammalian cell, or a lower eukaryotic cell, such as a yeast cell, or the host cell can be a prokaryotic cell, such as a bacterial cell. Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-Dextran mediated transfection, or electroporation (L. Davis et al., &ldquo;Basic Methods in Molecular Biology&rdquo;, 2nd edition, Appleton and Lang, Paramount Publishing, East Norwalk, Conn. &lsqb;1994&rsqb;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The constructs in host cells can be used in a conventional manner to produce the gene product encoded by the recombinant sequence. Alternatively, the polypeptides of the invention can be synthetically produced by conventional peptide synthesizers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Proteins can be expressed in mammalian cells, yeast, bacteria, or other cells under the control of appropriate promoters. Cell-free translation systems also can be employed to produce such proteins using RNAs derived from the DNA constructs of the present invention. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts are described by Sambrook et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual</italic></highlight>, Second Edition, (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989), which is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Transcription of a DNA encoding the polypeptides of the present invention by higher eukaryotes is increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers are cis-eukaryotes acting elements of DNA, usually about from 10 to 300 bp, that acts on a protmoter increase its transcription. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100 to 270), a cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, a polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Generally, recombinant expression vectors will include origins of replication and selectable markers permitting transformation of the host cell, e.g., the ampicillin resistance gene of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and the <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>TRP1 gene, and a promoter derived from a highly-expressed gene to direct transcription of a downstream structural sequence. Such promoters can be derived from operons encoding glycolytic enzymes such as 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), alpha factor, acid phosphatase, or heat shock proteins, among others. The heterologous structural sequence is assembled in appropriate phase with translation initiation and termination sequences, and preferably, a leader sequence capable of directing secretion of translated protein into the periplasmic space or extracellular medium. Optionally, the heterologous sequence can encode a fusion protein including an N-terminal identification peptide imparting desired characteristics, e.g., stabilization or simplified purification of expressed recombinant product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Useful expression vectors for bacterial use are constructed by inserting a structural DNA sequence encoding a desired protein together with suitable translation initiation and termination signals in operable reading phase with a functional promoter. The vector will comprise one or more phenotypic selectable markers and an origin of replication to ensure maintenance of the vector and to, if desirable, provide amplification within the host. Suitable prokaryotic hosts for transformation include <highlight><italic>E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium </italic></highlight>and various species within the genera Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, and Staphylococcus, although others may also be employed as a routine matter of choice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Useful expression vectors for bacterial use comprise a selectable marker and bacterial origin of replication derived from plasmids comprising genetic elements of the well-known cloning vector pBR322 (ATCC 37017). Other vectors include but are not limited to PKK223-3 (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Uppsala, Sweden) and GEM1 (Promega Biotec, Madison, Wis.). These pBR322 &ldquo;backbone&rdquo; sections are combined with an appropriate promoter and the structural sequence to be expressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Following transformation of a suitable host strain and growth of the host strain to an appropriate cell density, the selected promoter is derepressed by appropriate means (e.g., temperature shift or chemical induction), and cells are cultured for an additional period. Cells are typically harvested by centrifugation, disrupted by physical or chemical means, and the resulting crude extract retained for further purification. Microbial cells employed in expression of proteins can be disrupted by any convenient method, including freeze-thaw cycling, sonication, mechanical disruption, or use of cell lysing agents; such methods are well-known to the ordinary artisan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Various mammalian cell culture systems can also be employed to express recombinant protein. Examples of mammalian expression systems include the COS-7 lines of monkey kidney fibroblasts described by Gluzman, <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>23:175 (1981), and other cell lines capable of expressing a compatible vector, such as the C127, 3T3, CHO, HeLa and BHK cell lines. Mammalian expression vectors will comprise an origin of replication, a suitable promoter and enhancer, and also any necessary ribosome binding sites, polyadenylation site, splice donor and acceptor sites, transcriptional termination sequences, 5&prime; flanking nontranscribed sequences, and selectable markers such as the neomycin phosphotransferase gene. DNA sequences derived from the SV40 viral genome, for example, SV40 origin, early promoter, enhancer, splice, and polyadenylation sites may be used to provide the required nontranscribed genetic elements. Representative, useful vectors include pRc/CMV and pcDNA3 (available from Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The HIV-derived polypeptides are recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by known methods including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, hydroxyapatite chromatography or lectin chromatography. It is preferred to have low concentrations (approximately 0.1-5 mM) of calcium ion present during purification (Price et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>244:917 &lsqb;1969&rsqb;). Protein refolding steps can be used, as necessary, in completing configuration of the protein. Finally, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can be employed for final purification steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The polypeptides of the present invention may be naturally purified products expressed from a high expressing cell line, or a product of chemical synthetic procedures, or produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host (for example, by bacterial, yeast, higher plant, insect and mammalian cells in culture). Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the polypeptides of the present invention may be glycosylated with mammalian or other eukaryotic carbohydrates or may be non-glycosylated. The polypeptides of the invention may also include an initial methionine amino acid residue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The present invention further includes modified versions of the recombinant polypeptide to preclude glycosylation while allowing expression of a reduced carbohydrate form of the protein in yeast, insect or mammalian expression systems. Known methods for inactivating gylcosylation sites include, but are not limited to, those presented in U.S. Pat. No. 5,071,972 and EP 276,846, which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Other variants included in the present invention include those obtained by removal removal of sequences encoding cystein residues, thereby preventing formation of incorrect intramolecular disulfide bridges which decrease biological activity of the protein product. The constructs of the present invention also may be prepared by removal of the site of proteolytic processing, allowing expression in systems which contain a problematic protease, for example the KEX2 protease in yeast. Known methods for removing such protease sites include but are not limited to one method for removing KEX2 sites presented in EP212,914. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes the above peptides in the form of oligomers, dimers, trimers and higher order oligomers. Oligomers may be formed by several means including but not limited to disulfide bonds between peptides, non-covalent interactions between peptides, and poly-ethylene-glycol linkages between peptides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The fusion of the above peptides to peptide linkers or peptides that are capable of promoting oligomers is also encompassed in this invention. Such peptides include but are not limited to leucine zippers and antibody derived peptides, such as is described in Landschulz et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>240:1759 (1988); Hollenbaugh and Aruffo, &ldquo;Construction of Immunoglobin Fusion Proteins&rdquo;, in <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Immunology, Supplement </italic></highlight>4, pgs 10.19.1-10.19.11 (1992) John Wiley and sons, New York, N.Y. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The starting plasmids can be constructed from available plasmids in accord with published, known procedures. In addition, equivalent plasmids to those described are known in the art and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Once homogeneous cultures of recombinant cells are obtained, large quantities of recombinantly produced protein can be recovered from the conditioned medium and analyzed using chromatographic methods well known in the art. An alternative method for the production of large amounts of secreted protein involves the transformation of mammalian embryos and the recovery of the recombinant protein from milk produced by transgenic cows, goats, sheep, etc. Polypeptides and closely related molecules may be expressed recombinantly in such a way as to facilitate protein purification. One approach involves expression of a chimeric protein which includes one or more additional polypeptide domains not naturally present on human polypeptides. Such purification-facilitating domains include, but are not limited to, metal-chelating peptides such as histidine-tryptophan domains that allow purification on immobilized metals, protein A domains that allow purification on immobilized immunoglobulin, and the domain utilized in the FLAGS extension/affinity purification system (Immunex Corp, Seattle, Wash.). The inclusion of a cleavable linker sequence such as Factor XA or enterolinase from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA) between the polypeptide sequence and the purification domain may be useful for recovering the polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> It is also contemplated and within the scope of the present invention that the above recombinant antigens will be used in a variety of immunoassay formats, including but not limited to direct and indirect assays. The means for adapting the antigens to such various formats&mdash;as by conjugation to labels or macromolecules, or immobilization on suitable support surfaces&mdash;are well-understood and should be familiar to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> For example, the polypeptides including their fragments or derivatives or analogs thereof of the present invention, or cells expressing them, can be used for the detection of antibodies to HIV (as well as an immunogen to produce antibodies). These antibodies can be, for example, polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, chimeric, single chain and humanized antibodies, as well as Fab fragments, or the product of an Fab expression library. Various procedures known in the art may be used for the production of such antibodies and fragments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Further, antibodies generated against a polypeptide corresponding to a sequence of the present invention can be obtained by direct injection of the polypeptide into an animal or by administering the polypeptide to an animal such as a mouse, rabbit, goat or human. A mouse, rabbit or goat is preferred. The antibody so obtained then will bind the polypeptide itself. In this manner, even a sequence encoding only a fragment of the polypeptide can be used to generate antibodies that bind the native polypeptide. Such antibodies can then be used to isolate the polypeptide from test samples such as tissue suspected of containing that polypeptide. For preparation of monoclonal antibodies, any technique which provides antibodies produced by continuous cell line cultures can be used. Examples include the hybridoma technique as described by Kohler and Milstein, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>256:495-497 (1975), the trioma technique, the human B-cell hybridoma technique as described by Kozbor et al, <highlight><italic>Immun. Today </italic></highlight>4:72 (1983), and the EBV-hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies as described by Cole et al., in <highlight><italic>Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, </italic></highlight>Alan R. Liss, Inc, New York, N.Y., pp. 77-96 (1985). Techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies to immunogenic polypeptide products of this invention. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,778, which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Various assay formats may utilize such antibodies, including &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; immunoassays and probe assays. For example, the monoclonal antibodies or fragment as described above can be employed in various assay systems to determine the presence, if any, of HIV-derived polypeptide in a test sample. For example, in a first assay format, a polyclonal or monoclonal antibody or fragment thereof, or a combination of these antibodies, which has been coated on a solid phase, is contacted with a test sample, to form a first mixture. This first mixture is incubated for a time and under conditions sufficient to form antigen/antibody complexes. Then, an indicator reagent comprising a monoclonal or a polyclonal antibody or a fragment thereof, or a combination of these antibodies, to which a signal generating compound has been attached, is contacted with the antigen/antibody complexes to form a second mixture. This second mixture then is incubated for a time and under conditions sufficient to form antibody/antigen/antibody complexes. The presence of an HIV-derived polypeptide antigen present in the test sample and captured on the solid phase, if any, is determined by detecting the measurable signal generated by the signal generating compound. The amount of HIV-derived polypeptide antigen present in the test sample is proportional to the signal generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Or, a polyclonal or monoclonal HIV-derived polypeptide antibody or fragment thereof, or a combination of these antibodies which is bound to a solid support, the test sample and an indicator reagent comprising a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody or fragments thereof, which specifically binds to HIV-derived polypeptide antigen, or a combination of these antibodies to which a signal generating compound is attached, are contacted to form a mixture. This mixture is incubated for a time and under conditions sufficient to form antibody/antigen/antibody complexes. The presence, if any, of HIV-derived polypeptide present in the test sample and captured on the solid phase is determined by detecting the measurable signal generated by the signal generating compound. The amount of HIV-derived polypeptide proteins present in the test sample is proportional to the signal generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In another assay format, one or a combination of at least two monoclonal antibodies can be employed as a competitive probe for the detection of antibodies to HIV-derived polypeptide protein. For example, HIV-derived polypeptide proteins such as the recombinant antigens disclosed herein, either alone or in combination, are coated on a solid phase. A test sample suspected of containing antibody to HIV-derived polypeptide antigen then is incubated with an indicator reagent comprising a signal generating compound and at least one monoclonal antibody for a time and under conditions sufficient to form antigen/antibody complexes of either the test sample and indicator reagent bound to the solid phase or the indicator reagent bound to the solid phase. The reduction in binding of the monoclonal antibody to the solid phase can be quantitatively measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In yet another detection method, each of the monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies can be employed in the detection of HIV-derived polypeptide antigens in fixed tissue sections, as well as fixed cells by immunohistochemical analysis. Cytochemical analysis wherein these antibodies are labeled directly (with, for example, fluorescein, colloidal gold, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, etc.) or are labeled by using secondary labeled anti-species antibodies (with various labels as exemplified herein) may be used to track the histopathology of disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In addition, these monoclonal antibodies can be bound to matrices similar to CNBr-activated Sepharose and used for the affinity purification of specific HIV-derived polypeptide proteins from cell cultures or biological tissues such as to purify recombinant and native HIV-derived polypeptide antigens and proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Monoclonal antibodies can also be used for the generation of chimeric antibodies for therapeutic use, or other similar applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The monoclonal antibodies or fragments thereof can be provided individually to detect HIV-derived polypeptide antigens. Combinations of the monoclonal antibodies (and fragments thereof) also may be used together as components in a mixture or &ldquo;cocktail&rdquo; of at least one HIV-derived polypeptide antibody with antibodies to other HIV-derived polypeptide regions, each having different binding specificities. Thus, this cocktail can include monoclonal antibodies which are directed to HIV-derived polypeptide proteins of HIV and other monoclonal antibodies to other antigenic determinants of the HIV-derived polypeptide genome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The polyclonal antibody or fragment thereof which can be used in the assay formats should specifically bind to an HIV-derived polypeptide region or other HIV-derived polypeptide proteins used in the assay. The polyclonal antibody used preferably is of mammalian origin; human, goat, rabbit or sheep anti-HIV-derived polypeptide polyclonal antibody can be used. Most preferably, the polyclonal antibody is rabbit polyclonal anti-HIV-derived polypeptide antibody. The polyclonal antibodies used in the assays can be used either alone or as a cocktail of polyclonal antibodies. Since the cocktails used in the assay formats are comprised of either monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal antibodies having different HIV-derived polypeptide specificity, they would be useful for diagnosis, evaluation and prognosis of HIV-derived polypeptide condition, as well as for studying HIV-derived polypeptide protein differentiation and specificity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated and within the scope of the present invention that HIV-derived polypeptides may be detectable in assays by use of recombinant antigens as well as by use of synthetic peptides or purified peptides, which contain amino acid sequences of HIV-derived polypeptides. It also is within the scope of the present invention that different synthetic, recombinant or purified peptides identifying different epitopes of each such HIV-derived polypeptide can be used in combination in an assay to diagnose, evaluate, or prognosticate the HIV disease condition. In this case, these peptides can be coated onto one solid phase, or each separate peptide may be coated on separate solid phases, such as microparticles, and then combined to form a mixture of peptides which can be later used in assays. Furthermore, it is contemplated that multiple peptides which define epitopes from different polypeptides may be used in combination to make a diagnosis, evaluation, or prognosis of HIV disease. Peptides coated on solid phases or labeled with detectable labels are then allowed to compete with peptides from a patient sample for a limited amount of antibody. A reduction in binding of the synthetic, recombinant, or purified peptides to the antibody (or antibodies) is an indication of the presence of HIV-secreted polypeptides in the patient sample which in turn indicates the presence of HIV gene in the patient. Such variations of assay formats are known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are discussed herein below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In another assay format, the presence of antigens and/or antibodies to HIV-derived polypeptides can be detected in a simultaneous assay, as follows. A test sample is simultaneously contacted with a capture reagent of a first analyte, wherein said capture reagent comprises a first binding member specific for a first analyte attached to a solid phase and a capture reagent for a second analyte, wherein said capture reagent comprises a first binding member for a second analyte attached to a second solid phase, to thereby form a mixture. This mixture is incubated for a time and under conditions sufficient to form capture reagent/first analyte and capture reagent/second analyte complexes. These so-formed complexes then are contacted with an indicator reagent comprising a member of a binding pair specific for the first analyte labeled with a signal generating compound and an indicator reagent comprising a member of a binding pair specific for the second analyte labeled with a signal generating compound to form a second mixture. This second mixture is incubated for a time and under conditions sufficient to form capture reagent/first analyte/indicator reagent complexes and capture reagent/second analyte/indicator reagent complexes. The presence of one or more analytes is determined by detecting a signal generated in connection with the complexes formed on either or both solid phases as an indication of the presence of one or more analytes in the test sample. In this assay format, recombinant antigens may be utilized as well as monoclonal antibodies produced therefrom. Such assay systems are described in greater detail in EP Publication No. 0473065. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In yet other assay formats, the polypeptides disclosed herein may be utilized to detect the presence of antibodies specific for HIV-derived polypeptides in test samples. For example, a test sample is incubated with a solid phase to which at least one recombinant protein has been attached. These are reacted for a time and under conditions sufficient to form antigen/antibody complexes. Following incubation, the antigen/antibody complex is detected. Indicator reagents may be used to facilitate detection, depending upon the assay system chosen. In another assay format, a test sample is contacted with a solid phase to which a recombinant protein produced as described herein is attached and also is contacted with a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody specific for the protein, which preferably has been labeled with an indicator reagent. After incubation for a time and under conditions sufficient for antibody/antigen complexes to form, the solid phase is separated from the free phase, and the label is detected in either the solid or free phase as an indication of the presence of HIV-derived polypeptide antibody. Other assay formats utilizing the recombinant antigens disclosed herein are contemplated. These include contacting a test sample with a solid phase to which at least one antigen from a first source has been attached, incubating the solid phase and test sample for a time and under conditions sufficient to form antigen/antibody complexes, and then contacting the solid phase with a labeled antigen, which antigen is derived from the same source or, alternatively, a second source different from the first source. For example, a recombinant protein derived from a first source such as <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>is used as a capture antigen on a solid phase, a test sample is added to the so-prepared solid phase, and a recombinant protein derived from a different source (i.e., non-<highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>) is utilized as a part of an indicator reagent. Likewise, combinations of a recombinant antigen on a solid phase and synthetic peptide in the indicator phase also are possible. Any assay format which utilizes an antigen specific for HIV-derived polypeptide from a first source as the capture antigen and an antigen specific for HIV-derived polypeptide from a second source are contemplated. Thus, various combinations of recombinant antigens, as well as the use of synthetic peptides, purified proteins, and the like, are within the scope of this invention. Assays such as this and others are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,254,458, which enjoys common ownership and is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments which utilize various other solid phases also are contemplated and are within the scope of this invention. For example, ion capture procedures for immobilizing an immobilizable reaction complex with a negatively charged polymer (described in EP publication 0326100 and EP publication No. 0406473), can be employed according to the present invention to effect a fast solution-phase immunochemical reaction. An immobilizable immune complex is separated from the rest of the reaction mixture by ionic interactions between the negatively charged poly-anion/immune complex and the previously treated, positively charged porous matrix and detected by using various signal generating systems previously described, including those described in chemiluminescent signal measurements as described in EPO Publication No. 0 273,115. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Also, the methods of the present invention can be adapted for use in systems which utilize microparticle technology including in automated and semi-automated systems wherein the solid phase comprises a microparticle (magnetic or non-magnetic). Such systems include those described in published EPO applications Nos. EP 0 425 633 and EP 0 424 634, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The use of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) for immunoassays also is a technology to which the monoclonal antibodies of the present invention are easily adaptable. In scanning probe microscopy, in particular in atomic force microscopy, the capture phase, for example, at least one of the monoclonal antibodies of the invention, is adhered to a solid phase and a scanning probe microscope is utilized to detect antigen/antibody complexes which may be present on the surface of the solid phase. The use of scanning tunneling microscopy eliminates the need for labels which normally must be utilized in many immunoassay systems to detect antigen/antibody complexes. The use of SPM to monitor specific binding reactions can occur in many ways. In one embodiment, one member of a specific binding partner (analyte specific substance which is the monoclonal antibody of the invention) is attached to a surface suitable for scanning. The attachment of the analyte specific substance may be by adsorption to a test piece which comprises a solid phase of a plastic or metal surface, following methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Or, covalent attachment of a specific binding partner (analyte specific substance) to a test piece which test piece comprises a solid phase of derivatized plastic, metal, silicon, or glass may be utilized. Covalent attachment methods are known to those skilled in the art and include a variety of means to irreversibly link specific binding partners to the test piece. If the test piece is silicon or glass, the surface must be activated prior to attaching the specific binding partner. Also, polyelectrolyte interactions may be used to immobilize a specific binding partner on a surface of a test piece by using techniques and chemistries. The preferred method of attachment is by covalent means. Following attachment of a specific binding member, the surface may be further treated with materials such as serum, proteins, or other blocking agents to minimize non-specific binding. The surface also may be scanned either at the site of manufacture or point of use to verify its suitability for assay purposes. The scanning process is not anticipated to alter the specific binding properties of the test piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> While the present invention discloses the preference for the use of solid phases, it is contemplated that the reagents such as antibodies, proteins and peptides of the present invention can be utilized in non-solid phase assay systems. These assay systems are known to those skilled in the art, and are considered to be within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The present invention will be better understood in connection with the following examples, which are meant to illustrate, but not to limit, the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Cloning Procedures </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Oligonucleotides for gene construction and sequencing were synthesized at Abbott Laboratories, Synthetic Genetics (San Diego, Calif.) or Oligo Etc. (Wilsonville, Calif.). All polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagents, including AmpliTaq DNA polymerase and UlTma DNA polymerase, were purchased from Perkin-Elmer Corporation (Foster City, Calif.) and used according to the manufacturer&apos;s specifications unless otherwise indicated. PCR amplifications were performed on a GeneAmp 9600 thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer). Unless indicated otherwise, restriction enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, Mass.) and digests were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. DNA fragments used for cloning were isolated on agarose (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.) gels, unless otherwise indicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Desired fragments were excised and the DNA was extracted with a QIAEX II gel extraction kit or the QlAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, Calif.) as recommended by the manufacturer. DNA was resuspended in H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O or TE &lsqb;1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; pH 8.0; BRL Life Technologies), 10 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-hydrochloride (Tris-HCl; pH 8.0; BRL Life Technologies)&rsqb;. Ligations were performed using a Stratagene DNA ligation kit (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, Calif.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Ligations were incubated at 16&deg; C. overnight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Bacterial transformations were performed using MAX EFFICIENCY DH5&agr; competent cells (BRL Life Technologies) or Epicurian Coi XL1-Blue supercompetent cells (Stratagene Cloning Systems) following the manufacturer&apos;s protocols. Unless indicated otherwise, transformations and bacterial restreaks were plated on LB agar (Lennox) plates with 150 &mgr;g/ml ampicillin (M1090; MicroDiagnostics, Lombard, Ill.) or on LB agar&plus;ampicillin plates supplemented with glucose to a fmal concentration of 20 mM, as noted. All bacterial incubations (plates and overnight cultures) were conducted overnight (&tilde;16 hours) at 37&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Screening of transformants to identify desired clones was accomplished by sequencing of miniprep DNA and/or by colony PCR. Miniprep DNA was prepared with a Qiagen Tip 20 Plasmid Prep Kit or a Qiagen QIAwell 8 Plasmid Prep Kit following the manufacturer&apos;s specifications, unless otherwise indicated. For colony PCR screening, individual colonies were picked from transformation plates and transferred into a well in a sterile flat-bottom 96-well plate (Costar, Cambridge, Mass. ) containing 100 &mgr;l sterile H<highlight><subscript>2 O</subscript></highlight>. One-third of the volume was transferred to a second plate and stored at 4&deg; C. The original 96-well plate was microwaved for 5 minutes to disrupt the cells. 1 &mgr;l volume then was transferred to a PCR tube as template. 9 &mgr;l of a PCR master mix containing 1 &mgr;l 10X PCR buffer, 1 &mgr;L 2 mM dNTPs, 1 &mgr;l (10 pmol) sense primer, 1 &mgr;(10 pmol) anti-sense primer, 0.08 &mgr;l AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (0.4 units), and 4.2 &mgr;l H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>O was added to the PCR tube. Reactions were generally amplified for 20-25 cycles of 94&deg; C. for 30 seconds, 50-60&deg; C. (depending on primer annealing temperatures) for 30 seconds and 72&deg; C. for 60 seconds. Primers were dependent on the insert and cycle conditions were modified based on primer annealing temperatures and the length of the expected product. After cycling, approximately &frac13; of the reaction volume was loaded on an agarose gel for analysis. Colonies containing desired clones were propagated from the transfer plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Unless otherwise indicated, DNA sequencing was performed on an automated ABI Model 373A Stretch Sequencer (Perkin Elmer). Sequencing reactions were set up with reagents from a FS TACS Dye Term Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin Elmer) and 250-500 ng plasmid DNA according to the manufacturer&apos;s specifications. Reactions were processed on Centri-Sep columns (Princeton Separations, Adelphia, N.J.) prior to loading on the Sequencer. Sequence data was analyzed using Sequencher 3.0 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, Mich.) and GeneWorks 2.45 (Oxford Molecular Group, Inc., Campbell, Calif.). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Determination of the env Sequence of the HIV-1 Group O Isolate HAM112 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Viral RNA was extracted from culture supernatants of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected with the HIV-1 Group O isolate designated HAM112 (H. Hampl et al., <highlight><italic>Infection </italic></highlight>23:369-370 &lsqb;1995&rsqb;) using a QIAamp Blood Kit (Qiagen) and the manufacturer&apos;s recommended procedure. RNA was eluted in a 50&mgr;l volume of nuclease-free water (5Prime-3Prime, Inc., Boulder, Colo.) and stored at &minus;70&deg; C. The strategy for obtaining the env region sequence involved cDNA synthesis and PCR (nested) amplification of four overlapping env gene fragments. The amplified products were sequenced directly on an automated ABI Model 373A Stretch Sequencer. Amplification reactions were carried out with GeneAmp RNA PCR and GeneAmp PCR Kits (Perkin Elmer) as outlined by the manufacturer. Oligonucleotide primer positions correspond to the HIV-1 ANT70 env sequence (G. Myers et al., eds., supra). The primers env 10R &lsqb;nucleotide (nt) 791-772; SEQ ID NO:62&rsqb;, env15R (nt 1592-1574; SEQ ID NO:63), env22R (nt 2321-2302; SEQ ID NO:64), env26R (nt 250-232 3&prime; of env; SEQ ID NO:65) were used for cDNA synthesis of fragments 1-4, respectively. Reverse transcription reactions were incubated at 42&deg; C. for 30 minutes then at 99&deg; C. for 5 minutes. First-round PCR amplifications consisted of 30 cycles of 95&deg; C. for 30 seconds, 52&deg; C for 30 seconds, and 72&deg; C. for 1 minute using the primer combinations: env1F (nt 184-166 5&prime; of env; SEQ ID NO:66) and env10R (SEQ ID NO:62), env7F (nt 564-586; SEQ ID NO:67) and env15R (SEQ ID NO:63), env12F (nt 1289-1308; SEQ ID NO:68) and env22R (SEQ ID NO:64), env19F (nt 2020-2040; SEQ ID NO:69) and env26R (SEQ ID NO:65) for fragments 1 through 4, respectively. For the second round of amplification (nested PCR), 5 &mgr;l of the respective first-round PCR reactions was used as template along with the primer combinations env2F (nt 37-15 5&prime; of env; SEQ ID NO:70) and env9R (nt 740-721; SEQ ID NO:71), env8F (nt 631-650; SEQ ID NO:72) and env14R (nt 1437-1416; SEQ ID NO:73), env13F (nt 1333-1354; SEQ ID NO:74) and env21R (nt 2282-2265; SEQ ID NO:75), env20F (nt 2122-2141; SEQ ID NO:76) and env25R (nt 111-94 3&prime; of env; SEQ ID NO:77) for fragments 1 through 4, respectively. Second-round amplification conditions were identical to those used for the first round. Fragments were agarose gel-purified and extracted with a Qiagen QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit. Fragments were sequenced directly with the primers used for nested PCR along with primers env4F (SEQ ID NO:78) and env5R (SEQ ID NO:79) for fragment 1; primers env10F (SEQ ID NO:80), env11F (SEQ ID NO:81), env11R (SEQ ID NO:82), env12F (SEQ ID NO:68), and AG1 (SEQ ID NO:87) for fragment 2; primers env15F (SEQ ID NO:83) and env19R (SEQ ID NO:84) for fragment 3; primers env22F (SEQ ID NO:85) and env24R (SEQ ID NO:86) for fragment 4.

<heading lvl="1">Construction of Synthetic HIV-1 Group O env gp120 /gp41 Genes </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts the strategy used to generate synthetic HIV-1 Group O env gp120/gp41 gene constructs. The env gp120/gp41 sequences were based on the HIV-1 Group O isolate HAM112 (SEQ ID NO:61). Determination of the env sequence of HAM112 is outlined in Example 2, hereinabove. Oligonucleotides were designed that encode the C-terminal 45 amino acids of the env gp120 and 327 amino acids of env gp41 (nucleotide &num;1 is the first base of the first codon of gp120 in the synthetic gene). The synthetic gene has a 26 amino acid deletion (nucleotides 643 through 720), relative to the native HAM112 gp41, that encompasses a highly hydrophobic (H) region (transmembrane region) of gp41. Thus, the full-length synthetic gp41 gene constructed is 327 amino acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In the synthetic oligonucleotides, the native HIV-1 codons were altered to conform to <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>codon bias in an effort to increase expression levels of the recombinant protein in <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>. See, for example, M. Gouy and C. Gautier, <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Research </italic></highlight>10:7055 (1982); H. Grosjean and W.

(eds.), <highlight><italic>Molecular Biology of the Gene, </italic></highlight>4th Ed., Benjamin Kumming Publishing Co., pp.440 (1987). The gene construction strategy involved synthesis of a series of overlapping oligonucleotides with complementary ends (Osyn-A through Osyn-L, depicted as A through L). When annealed, the ends served as primers for the extension of the complementary strand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The fragments then were amplified by PCR. This process (&ldquo;PCR knitting&rdquo; of oligonucleotides) was reiterated to progressively enlarge the gene fragment. Oligonucleotide Osyn-5&prime; was designed for cloning into the PL vector pKRR826. The expression vector, pKRR826, is a modified form of the lambda pL promoter vector pSDKR816, described in U.S. Ser. No. 08/314,570, incorporated herein by reference. pKRR826 is a high copy number derivative of pBR322 that contains the temperature sensitive cI repressor gene (Benard et al., <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>5:59 &lsqb;1979&rsqb;). However, pKRR826 lacks the translational terminator rrnBt1 and has the lambda pL and lambda pR promoters in the reverse orientation, relative to pSDKR816. The polylinker region of pKRR826 contains Eco RI and Bam HI restriction enzyme sites but lacks an ATG start codon. Optimal expression is obtained when the 5&prime; end of the gene insert (including an N-terminal methionine) is cloned into the EcoRI site. Osyn-5&prime; was designed to contain an Eco RI restriction site for cloning and an ATG codon (methionine) to provide for proper translational initiation of the recombinant proteins. The anti-sense oligonucleotides Osyn-O3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:15), Osyn-P3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:16), and Osyn-M (M) (SEQ ID NO: 14) each contain two sequential translational termination codons (TAA,TAG) and a Bam HI restriction site. When outside primers Osyn-5&prime; (SEQ ID NO: 11) and Osyn-M (M) (SEQ ID NO:14) were used, a full-length gp41 (327 amino acids) gene was synthesized (pGO-11PL; SEQ ID NO:52). Outside oligonucleotides Osyn-5&prime; (SEQ ID NO: 11) and Osyn-O3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:15) resulted in a truncated gp41 product of 199 amino acids (pGO-9PL; SEQ ID NO:48). Alternatively, outside oligonucleotides Osyn-5&prime; (SEQ ID NO: 11) and Osyn-P3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:16) resulted in a truncated gp41 product 169 amino acids in length (pGO-8PL; SEQ ID NO:58). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The synthetic genes also were expressed as CMP-KDO synthetase (CKS) fusion proteins. PCR-mediated transfer of the synthetic genes from pKRR826 into pJO200 (described in U.S. Ser. No. 572,822, and incorporated herein by reference) was accomplished with an alternative outside sense oligonucleotide PCR primer (5&prime; end), Osyn-5&prime; CKS (SEQ ID NO:25). Osyn-5&prime; CKS contained an Eco RI restriction site and resulted in the in-frame fusion of the synthetic gene insert to CKS in the expression vector pJO200. The 3&prime; outside primers (antisense) Osyn-M (SEQ ID NO: 14), Osyn-O3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:15) and Osyn-P3&prime; (SEQ ID NO:16) were used in combination with Osyn-5&prime; CKS (SEQ ID NO:25) to generate pGO-11CKS (SEQ ID NO:54), pGO-9CKS (SEQ ID NO:50), and pGO-8 CKS (SEQ ID NO:60), respectively.

If antibody to antigen 2 was present in the test sample, a visible reaction was indicated in the capture zone area of antigen 2 and in the assay completion zone, and not in the zones of antigen 1 or antigen 3. If antibody to antigen 3 was present in the test sample, a visible reaction was indicated in the capture zone area of antigen 3 and in the assay completion zone, and not in the zones of antigen 1 or antigen 2. Also, a negative control should be non-reactive (show no visible reaction) in the zones of antigen 1, antigen 2 and antigen 3, but should be reactive in the assay completion zone. A positive control (known reactive antibody to antigen 1, 2 and/or 3) should be reactive in the zone of the appropriate antigen to which it specifically binds in an antigen/antibody reaction.

<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> (i) Assaying for Antibodies in Blood, Urine and Saliva. The blood, urine, and saliva of three patients (identified by patient numbers 0109, 4068, and 4475) were tested on nitrocellulose solid phase devices of the invention as described herein and following the assay protocol as set forth hereinabove. Each blood and urine test sample of each patient 0109, 4068 and 4475 was reactive with antigen 1 (pTB319; SEQ ID NO:56). The saliva test sample of patients 4068 and 4475 also were reactive with antigen 1, while patient 0109&apos;s saliva test sample was non-reactive in the test device of the invention. The saliva test sample of patient 0109 was later retested by a standard EIA and confirmed non-reactive for antibodies to HIV-1 gp41, indicating that the results obtained for the saliva test sample of patient 0109 were valid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> (ii) Assaying Negative Samples for HIV Antibodies. Two negative sera and two negative whole blood test samples, each spiked with the same two negative sera, were tested. Samples contained no antibodies specific for the relevant antigens and the test samples were negative after assay on the test (i.e. no reactivity, as indicated by no visible bar signifying a reaction in either position O, M or 2). Test sample was present in each test device, as indicated by a positive reaction bar in the test sample reactivity zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> (iii) Assaying for HIV-1 Group M Antibody. Five HIV-1 Group M sera and five whole blood samples spiked with the HIV-1 Group M positive sera were tested using ten devices. HIV-1 Group M samples were seen to contain antibodies specific for HIV-1 Group M antigen (pTB319) as shown by development of a reaction line at the HIV-1 Group M antigen zone, and visible reaction lines could be seen in the assay completion zone of nine out of 10 test devices. Although a band was present in one particular test device in the capture zone for HIV-1 group M antibody, test sample did not reach the assay completion zone and, thus, the assay needed to be repeated for this particular sample. No cross-reactivity was observed with the capture reagents for HIV group O and HIV-2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> (iv) Assaying for HIV-1 Group O Antibodies. Two confirmed positive HIV-1 Group O sera and two whole blood test samples spiked with HIV-1 Group O sera were tested using an additional four devices. The HIV-1 Group O samples were found to contain antibodies specific for HIV-1 Group O antigen as indicated by a positive bar result in the HIV-1 Group O antigen capture zone area, with reaction lines visible in the assay completion zone of each device. No cross-reaction with HIV-1 group M or HIV-2 capture antigens (no visible bar) was observed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> (v) Assaying for HIV-2 Antibodies. Ten further test devices were used to test five HIV-2 confirmed positive sera and whole blood spiked with the 5 HIV-2 sera. The HIV-2 samples were found to contain antibodies specific for HIV-2 antigen (pHIV210) as shown by reaction bars at the HIV-2 antigen zone. No reaction was observed between these test samples and the HIV-1 Group O or HIV-1 Group M antigens; visible reaction lines were seen in the assay completion zone of each device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> (vi) Assaying HIV-1 Group M, HIV-1 Group O, HIV-2 and Negative Samples. Four final devices were used to test an HIV-1 Group M-positive test sample, an HIV-1 Group O-positive test sample, an HIV-2-positive test sample and a negative control sample. The negative test serum did not react with any antigen in the antigen capture zone; the HIV-1 Group M-positive test sample was reactive only with the HIV-1 Group M antigen; the HIV-1 Group O-positive test sample was reactive only with the HIV-1 Group O antigen; and the HIV-2-positive test sample was reactive only with the HIV-2 antigen. Visible reaction lines were seen in the assay completion zone of each device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> The five HIV-1 group M and the two HIV-1 group O test samples used were confirmed seropositive samples which had been previously tested using a commercially-available enzyme immunoassay (Abbott &num;3A77) and had been PCR amplified, sequenced and subtyped based on phylogenetic analysis. The five HIV-2 samples used were seropositive using the same EIA and were confirmed as HIV-2-positive samples using an HIV-2 Western blot test (Sanofi). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> A. Modification of pT319 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> The plasmid pTB319 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,124,255, incorporated herein by reference) encodes a truncated gp41 recombinant protein due to a one base deletion within the synthetic HIV-1 Group M gp41gene resulting in a frame-shift. In order to facilitate the generation of HIV-1 Group M and Group O hybrid gene constructs, site-specific mutagenesis was used to eliminate the frame-shift within the gp41 coding region in pTB319. This was accomplished by sequentially digesting the plasmid pTB319 with the restriction endonucleases Rsr II and Bst XI. The synthetic oligonucleotides pTB319&plus;A (SEQ ID NO:98) and pTB319&plus;T (SEQ ID NO:99) were annealed and ligated into the Rsr II and Bst XI digested pTB319. The ligation product was used to transform supercompetent XL1-Blue cells and the cells were plated on LB agar plates supplemented with 150 &mgr;g/ml ampicillin. Colony PCR was used to identify correctly modified clones using the primer combinations pTB-S4 (SEQ ID NO: 100)/pTB-S7 (SEQ ID NO:101) and pTB-S4 (SEQUENCE ID NO:100)/63168 (SEQ ID NO:121). Overnight cultures were established for candidate clones in LB broth supplemented with 3 mM glucose and 200 &mgr;g/ml ampicillin for preparation of miniprep DNA. The entire coding region was sequenced using the oligonucleotide primers: 43461 (SEQ ID NO:2), 43285 (SEQ ID NO: 1), CKS-1 (SEQ ID NO:30), CKS-3 (SEQ ID NO:32), pTB-S1 (SEQ ID NO: 102), pTB-S2 (SEQ ID NO:103), pTB-S3 (SEQ ID NO:104), pTB-S4 (SEQ ID NO:100), pTB-S5 (SEQ ID NO:105), pTB-S6 (SEQ ID NO:106), pTB-S7 (SEQ ID NO:101), and pTB-S8 (SEQ ID NO:28). Based on sequencing results, clone pTB319&plus;A-&num;31 (pGMcks-1) has the desired coding region sequence. This clone was subsequently designated as pGM-1CKS/XL1 (SEQ ID NO:107 presents the nucleotide sequence of the coding region). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> presents the amino acid sequence of the pGM-1CKS recombinant protein (SEQ ID NO: 108). </paragraph>

The beads were then incubated with 60 ml 0.5% sucrose in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature. After 15 minutes, the sucrose was aspirated and the beads were allowed to air dry. Coated beads were strored in polypropylene bottles with a desiccant at 4&deg; C. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> Recombinant antigen coated beads were tested for reactivity against a variety of samples using the Abbott Laboratories 3A11 kit (first generation, indirect assay format). Samples were diluted and added to wells in polystyrene trays. Beads were added and the trays were incubated at 40&deg; C. for 1 hour. The trays were washed with water in an Abbott Laboratories QUICKWASH device. Next the kit conjugate, an anti-human IgG-Horseraddish Peroxidase, was added and the trays were again incubated at 40&deg; C. for one hour. The trays were again washed and 300 &mgr;l of substrate solution, (1.28 mg/ml o-Phenylenediamine&middot;HCl in Citrate-Phosphate buffer containing 0.02% Hydrogen Peroxide), was added to each well for 30 minutes at room temperature. 1 ml of 1N sulfuric acid was added to stop the reaction, and the trays were read in an Abbott QUANTUM spectrophotometer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> The samples used for this study were Normal human plasma, (Abbott Laboratories code 99800, lot 17535M400), used as a negative control; HIVPL-31 (Group M positive sera), and the following Group O positive sera: 14283, 189404, 193Ha, 14791, 267Ha and ESP-1. All samples except the Normal human plasma control were run at three dilutions; 1: 1,000, 1:10,000 and 1: 100,000 in the kit specimen diluent. Each dilution of each sample was run in duplicate against each of the six beads, and the results of each dilution were averaged and plotted for each bead. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> The results of the above tests, shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, demonstrate the improvements in sensitivity and selectivity available by use of the recombinant antigens of the present invention. The bead coated with the HIV-1 Group M recombinant antigen (pTB319) detected the Group M serum sample, but failed to detect all but one of the Group O samples. The beads coated with only HIV-1 Group O recombinant antigens (pGO-9/CKS, pGO-11/PL, and PGO-15CKS) detected the Group O serum samples, but showed lower sensitivity in detection of the HIV-1 Group M sample. Beads that were coated with hybrid Group M and Group O recombinant antigens (pGO-12/CKS, and pGO-14/PL) were able to detect both HIV-1 Group M- and Group O-positive samples. Lastly, pGO-15/CKS, which has an additional sequence representing the Group O immunodominant region of gp41 linked by recombinant means to the carboxy end of the protein, showed greater reactivity to low-titer Group O samples. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> A. Assays </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> In order to evaluate the performance in immunoassays of antigen constructs of the present invention, recombinant antigens pGO-9CKS and pGO-11CKS were incorporated into four HIV-1HIV-2 immunoassays containing HIV-1 Group M (subtype B) reagents. The constructs were tested using one bead assay (Assay 1) and 3 automated microparticle-based assays (Assays 2-4). In all cases, the reactivity of HIV-1 Group O-infected specimens was assessed with (format 2) and without (format 1) incorporation of the HIV-1 group O recombinants. The coated beads/microparticles were reacted with multiple dilutions of the following HIV-1 Group O-positive human sera: ESP1, 189404, 193Ha, 341 Ha, 2156 and ABB {fraction (9/96)}. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> For Assay 1, purified pGO-11 CKS was incorporated into a commercially-available bead-based assay by coating the antigen construct onto quarter-inch polystyrene beads. The coated beads were reacted with a range of dilutions of HIV-1 Group O-positive human sera, washed, and then reacted with purified pGO-9CKS conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. After washing/separation of bound from unbound pGO-9CKS conjugate, substrate was added and the assay was completed as indicated in Example 14. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> For Assay 2, purified pGO-11CKS was incorporated into a second commercially-available assay by coating the antigen construct onto microparticles. The coated microparticles were reacted with the same range of dilutions of HIV-1 Group O-positive human sera utilized in Assay 1. The microparticles were then washed and subsequently reacted with biotinylated pGO-9CKS. After further washing, the microparticles were reacted with a polyclonal anti-biotin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The assay signal was developed by addition of the substrate methylumbelliferyl phosphate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> For Assay 3, purified pGO-11CKS was incorporated into a third commercially-available assay by coating the antigen construct on microparticles. The coated microparticles were again reacted with the same range of dilutions of HIV-1 Group O-positive human sera utilized in Assay 1. Next, the microparticles were washed and then reacted with biotinylated pGO-9CKS. After washing, the microparticles were reacted with an anti-biotin antibody conjugated to acridinium as the signal-generating compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> For Assay 4, purified pGO-11CKS was incorporated into a developmental assay by coating the antigen construct onto magnetic microparticles. As in Assay 1, the coated microparticles were reacted with a range of dilutions of HIV-1 Group O-positive human sera, washed, and subsequently reacted with pGO-9CKS conjugated to acridinium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> B. Results </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> The results of the above tests are presented in Tables 1 and 2 below, in which the data are presented as signal/cutoff (S/CO) ratios. Format 1 refers to the conventional assay without the antigen constructs of the present invention, while Format 2 refers to the assay supplemented with the HIV-1 group O constructs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> From these data, it can be seen that the addition of the HIV-1 Group O recombinants resulted in a significant enhancement of assay sensitivity for the HIV-1 Group O-infected sera at all of the dilutions tested. For example, in the case of Assay 1 and sample 193Ha a S/CO ratio of 7.14 was obtained at a 1:10 dilution using Format 1, while a similar S/CO (7.22) was obtained at a 160-fold greater dilution (1:1600) using Format 2. This trend was maintained across all of the tested assay platforms. The utility of the group O recombinants was particularily evident for sample 2156, which tested negative (S/CO &lt;1) in all 4 assays prior to the addition of the group O recombinants. With the addition of the HIV-1 Group O constructs, however, this sample 2156 tested positive in all four assays at a 1:400 dilution. In Assay 1, 2156 was still positive at a dilution of 1:5000. Addition of the recombinant reagents pGO- 9CKS and pGO-11CKS was thus seen to provide a substantially better sensitivity for HIV-1 Group O-infected sera when using the above direct-format immunoassays.
