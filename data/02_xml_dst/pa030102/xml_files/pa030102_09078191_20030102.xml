<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical disk apparatus and, more particularly, to such apparatus for recording and/or reproducing data (such as video signal data and audio signal data) onto and/or from an optical disk which utilizes a laser beam having a wavelength of 680 (nm) or less and a lens system having a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.7 or more and arranged to have a working distance of 560 &mgr;m or less so as to enable a relatively large amount of data to be recorded onto the optical disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Video and/or audio data may be recorded onto and/or reproduced from a number of different types of storage media such as a tape cassette and a so-called digital versatile disc (DVD). However, as hereinbelow described, the tape cassette and the DVD may have disadvantages associated therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A video tape cassette for consumer use may have approximately 2 hours of data recorded thereon. Although such recording time may be acceptable for consumer use, the reproduction quality may not always be acceptable. For example, 20 repeated use of a video tape cassette may adversely affect or even destroy data recorded on the respective tape so that upon reproduction relatively poor quality video/audio data may be provided. Additionally, the video tape cassette may not be conducive for enabling particular functions or operations, such as an easy access function, to be performed by a video tape cassette recorder/reproducer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A rewritable type DVD may have a shape and size approximately similar to that of a compact disc (CD) and may have 2.6 GB of data (such as video and/or audio data) recorded on one face thereof. Such amount of data may only provide approximately 1 hour of recording/reproduction time. Such relatively small amount of time may be unacceptable. For example, such small amount of recording time may necessitate the need for several DVDs to record a single motion picture. As a result, such use of multiple DVDs may be inconvenient for a user or consumer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An apparatus for recording and/or reproducing data onto/from a DVD may utilize a laser beam having a wavelength of 650 (nm) and a lens optical system having a numerical aperture of 0.6. Such apparatus may be operative to provide a number of functions or operations, such as editing, trick play, or the like. Additionally, such apparatus may utilize an effective access technique so as to enable operational modes to be quickly switched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A DVD, used in conjunction with a DVD player, may enable relatively high quality reproduction and may facilitate the operation of a number of functions, such as an easy access function. However, to enable two hours of recording/reproducing time from one side of a DVD (so as to provide the same recording/reproducing time as with the video tape cassette) and to enable the above functions (editing, easy access, and so forth) would require approximately 8 GB of data, whereas, as previously described, a single-sided DVD may only enable 2.6 GB of data to be recorded thereon. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Meandering of a groove carrying a guide groove of laser beam is varied successively in steps and a :-rotational speed of an optical disk is switched successively in steps in correspondence with the period of meandering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide an optical disk apparatus wherein one revolution of the optical disk is divided into a plurality of sectors based on address information which is recorded in a track, and wherein the user data is recorded in the sectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide an optical disk apparatus wherein user data is recorded on grooves and lands of the optical disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A still further object of the present invention is to provide an optical disk apparatus having a buffer memory wherein a speed of transmitting the user data for recording onto the optical disk is greater than a speed at which the data is supplied to the buffer memory and/or wherein a speed of transmitting the user data reproduced from the optical disk is greater than a speed at which the data is supplied from the buffer memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide an optical disk apparatus wherein user data is arranged in predetermined blocks and an error correction code is added thereto, and wherein the user data is recorded to or reproduced from an optical disk in one or more blocks in which a block has 32 or more KB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, an optical disk apparatus for recording and/or reproducing user data onto and/or from an optical disk is provided which has an optical head for irradiating a laser beam having a wavelength of approximately 680 (nm) or less to the optical disk and having a lens with a numerical aperture (NA) of approximately 0.7 or more and a working distance of approximately 560 (&mgr;m) or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present optical disk apparatus may record user data having a spot size approximately one half that of a DVD so as to provide relatively high recording density. As a result, such optical disk apparatus, when utilizing a Partial-Response Maximum-Likelihood (PRML) technique or the like or when the redundancy is reduced by using premastered address having relatively high efficiency and the like, may provide a recording capacity of approximately 8 GB on an optical disk. By setting the working distance to a relatively small value, an optical system may be formed by a lens having a small aperture and a relatively high numerical aperture of 0.7 or more. Further, in this situation, allowable center eccentricity between the lens faces and allowable face angle may be set to practical ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As an example, in this situation, when the working distance is set to 560 &mgr;m or less, a laser beam may be incident on an object lens with a beam diameter of 4.5 (mm) or less which is similar to a value utilized with a DVD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The shortest pit length associated with a DVD may be 0.4 &mgr;m. However, by utilizing the present optical disk apparatus with its numerical aperture, the shortest pit length or the shortest mark length may have a value of approximately 0.3 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> By using a shortest pit length or shortest mark length of 0.3 &mgr;m or less, a recording capacity of approximately 8 GB on an optical disk may be obtained. Further, when a so-called (1, 7) RLL modulation technique is applied thereto, a line density of approximately 0.23 &mgr;m/bit may be obtained, and when a PRML technique or the like is applied, a line density of approximately 0.23 &mgr;m/bit or less may be achieved. With a line density of 0.23 &mgr;m/bit, a recording capacity of approximately 8 GB on an optical disk may be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> When the above relationships are used, a track pitch may be determined having a value of 0.6 (&mgr;m) which still provides a recording capacity of 8 GB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Further, when the data transmitting speed is set to 11.08 (Mbps) or more, a continuous video signal may be recorded and/or reproduced while maintaining sufficient time period in seeking or the like even wherein the recording involves multiplexing an audio signal and a video signal which has been subjected to data compression by a MPEG2 technique in which a rate of 6 Mbps or more is needed for images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, user data may be efficiently recorded by adding redundant data so as to perform a recording operation with a redundancy of 23% or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> When an optical disk is accessed by an optical system having a relatively high numerical aperture, a skew margin of the optical disk may be reduced or compensated for by reducing the thickness of a light transmitting layer. In this situation, stable access may be provided to an optical disk by providing a light transmitting layer with a thickness value within a range of 10 through 177 (&mgr;m) with a discrepancy of&plus;/&minus; &Dgr;t in which &Dgr;t is defined by &Dgr;t&lE;5.26(&lgr;/NA<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>) Am wherein NA is numerical aperture and &lgr; is wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Further, dust or a defect on the surface of the optical disk may have an adverse affect or influence on the data recorded thereon. For example, dust having a size of 100 &mgr;m or more may produce a so-called burst error. However, storing such optical disk in a cartridge which enables access to the optical disk for an optical system may prevent or reduce the exposure of the optical disk to dust and the like so as to prevent or reduce adverse affects which may be otherwise caused by dust and the like. Additionally, such cartridge may protect the optical disk from scratches and other types of damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when meandering of a groove varies successively in steps and a rotational speed of an optical disk switches successively in steps in correspondence with the period of meandering, access may be provided to an optical disk by a so-called Zoned Constant Linear Velocity (ZCLV) technique. As a result, desired data may be efficiently recorded using an information recording face of the optical disk and lowering of access speed may be effectively avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Additionally, when one revolution of an optical disk is divided into a plurality of sectors and user data is recorded in the sectors, access speed thereto may be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Further, by recording information on both lands and grooves, an optical disk having a relatively narrow track pitch may be simply fabricated and a tracking error signal may be detected with a satisfactory signal-to-noise (SN) ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when the speed of transmitting user data for recording onto an optical disk or the speed of transmitting data reproduced from an optical disk and inputting to a buffer memory is greater than a speed at which the data is supplied to a buffer memory or the speed at which the data is outputted from the buffer memory, processing of a substitution(s) of a defect sector may be executed and functions such as simultaneous recording and reproducing, postrecording and the like may be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Additionally, error correction processing may be improved by performing such processing with a block having a size of 32 KB or more.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> A detailed explanation will now be provided of embodiments of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagram of a mastering device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to a first embodiment of the present invention. As hereinbelow more fully described, an optical disk may be fabricated by use of an original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which may be formed by exposing a laser beam thereon with the use of the mastering device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may have a coating resist on the surface of, for example, a glass substrate. Such disk may be rotated by a spindle motor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with a constant angular velocity, in accordance with the mastering device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> An optical head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may irradiate a laser beam L to the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in such a manner so as to be displaced successively from an inner peripheral side to an outer peripheral side of the original disk in synchronism with the rotation of the original disk by a predetermined threading mechanism. As a result, the optical head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may form a track in a spiral shape from the inner peripheral side to the outer peripheral side of the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this case, the optical head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is controlled by the threading mechanism to move or displace the beam approximately 1.0 (&mgr;m) in a period in which the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is rotated one rotation. As such, in the case of so called land and groove recording, a track may be formed having a track pitch of approximately 0.5 (&mgr;m). Incidentally, such track pitch in the case of land and groove recording is 1.48 times as much as the track pitch used in a DVD (which may be 0.74 &mgr;m). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> By utilizing the mastering device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, desired data may be recorded on an optical disk formed from the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> with a line record density of about 0.21 (&mgr;m/bit). As a result, 8 (GB) or more of data may be recorded on an optical disk by the following relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>4.7&times;((0.74&times;0.267)/(0.5&times;0.21))&gE;8 &emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, in Equation (1), numeral 4.7 indicates recording capacity (GB) of a DVD ROM or read only type DVD and numeral 0.74 and numeral 0.267 indicate a track pitch (&mgr;m) and a line record density (&mgr;m/bit) of DVD. Accordingly, a recording capacity by data processing the same as that of DVD is shown in Equation (1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Further, in forming an optical disk, the optical head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may set the spot diameter of the laser beam L such that the width of a groove formed by exposure of the laser beam L and the width of a land between contiguous grooves are substantially equal. Further, the spot shape and the amount of light of the laser beam are set such that an effective exposure range by the laser beam may be increased by about 120 (%) with regard to the width of the groove of a final target. Therefore, the optical head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may expose the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the laser beam such that an optical disk fabricated therefrom may have land and groove recording. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Further, the optical system or the optical head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be movable along a radial direction of the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> A drive circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may drive the optical head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in accordance with a drive signal SD received from a synthesizing circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In such situation, the drive circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may switch the condition in which the optical head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is driven in accordance with a position in which the laser beam is irradiated with a timing synchronized to the rotation of the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, in which the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be arranged or zoned as illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Incidentally, grooves and lands of the disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are also illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. That is, the master:mastering device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may successively form a track on the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such that a region having a radius of 24 (mm) through 58 (mm) may be set to an information recording face of an optical disk having a diameter of 120 (mm) which is substantially equal to that of a compact disk. In this case, the drive circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may switch the condition in which the optical head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is driven such that a sector structure may be formed by dividing the information recording face into radially shaped regions. Further, by successively changing in steps the timing of the switching from the inner peripheral side to the outer peripheral side, a number of zones Z<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> through Zn may be formed by dividing the information recording face in shapes of concentric circles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Thereby, the drive circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> forms a number of sectors on one track in the zone Z<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> at the innermost periphery and the number of sectors on one track is increased by 1 in accordance with successive displacement to zone Z<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . on the outer peripheral side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Marks A and B indicate boundaries of sectors which are magnified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. At such sector boundaries, the front of each sector is allocated to an address area AR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a successive remaining area AR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is allocated to a user area. The drive circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> under control of a system control circuit (not shown) may move or displace the position of the irradiating laser beam in the user area AR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in accordance with the drive signal SD such that grooves are formed to meander in the user area AR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Further, in an initial portion of the address area AR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the displacement of the position of the irradiating laser beam may be interrupted and the light amount of the laser beam may be intermittently increased by the drive signal SD whereby a pit row may be formed on a track center formed by a groove. Further, at a later portion of the address area AR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the position of the irradiating laser beam may be displaced onto track center formed by a land on the inner peripheral side and the light amount of the laser beam may be intermittently increased by the drive signal SD by which a pit row is formed on the track center formed by the land. Therefore, the drive circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may perform a recording operation by forming a pit row on a track center in correspondence with the address data of the sector formed by a succeeding groove at the earlier or initial half of the address area AR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and may perform a recording operation by forming a pit row on a track center in correspondence with the address data of the sector formed by a succeeding land on the inner peripheral side at the later half of the address area AR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, when an optical disk is to be fabricated from the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the drive circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may control the light amount of the irradiating laser beam such that the depths of the pits and grooves have a value or values which are approximately equal to &frac16; through &frac15; wavelength of the laser beam (which may have a wavelength of 650 (nm)). Additionally, the groove may have an amplitude or width of approximately 15 through 30 (nm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> A wobble signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may generate a sine wave signal having a predetermined frequency in synchronism with the rotation of the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as a wobble signal (WB) and may supply the same to the synthesizing circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the wobble signal WB may be obtained by increasing the frequency successively in steps in correspondence with the zoning arrangement described above with regard to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. As a result, the wobble signal WB from the wobble signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may cause the position of the irradiating laser beam to be displaced such that the groove may meander or vary for 397 periods per one sector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In this way, a length corresponding to 5 periods of the groove may be allocated to the address area (header area) AR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the groove may be formed to meander or vary for 3573 periods at the track of the zone Z<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> on the innermost periphery and the meandering of the groove may successively increase by 397 periods per one track in accordance with a shift of the zone on the outer peripheral side. Further, 25 bytes of data may be allocated to the user area AR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in one meandering period of the groove and such one period may have a length of about 42 (&mgr;m). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> An address signal forming circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may form an address signal SA whose value may change successively in accordance with the displacement of the optical head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as controlled by the system control circuit and may supply the formed address signal SA to the synthesizing circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. More particularly, the address signal forming circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may receive a timing signal (such as a frequency generating (FG) signal or the like) in synchronism with the rotation of the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by the spindle motor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or the like and may perform a counting operation on the timing signal by a predetermined counter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The address signal forming circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may form a sector header in a first or an earlier half and in a second or later half of the address area AR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A, 4B</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As shown therein, the header may include sector marks SM, timing data for synchronization VFO, address marks AM, address data ID, and a potables PA. Each sector header may have 61 bytes of data and the address area AR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may have 8 Kbytes. (The numbers shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> indicate numbers of bytes.) The sector mark SM may indicate the start of the sector head and may have 4 bytes of data. The synchronization timing data VFO areas may be utilized in locking a phase-locked loop (PLL) circuit in the optical disk device and may have 26 bytes and 16 bytes, respectively, from the front side. The address mark AM is a synchronization signal of address and may have 1 byte. The address data ID may provide an indication of the position of the irradiating laser beam and may have 6 bytes, 2 bytes of which constitute an error detection code. The same data may be recorded twice for the address data ID so as to improve the reliability thereof. The potables PA may be arranged or utilized in setting the polarity of a signal and may have one byte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The address signal forming circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may convert the sector header formed as mentioned above into a serial data row and may modulate the serial data row in a predetermined manner and may output the modulated signal as the address signal SA. The address signal forming circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may output the address signal SA with a timing corresponding to the scanning of the laser beam L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The synthesizing circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> may receive the wobble signal WB and the address signal SA and may synthesize the same to form the drive signal SD comprising a displacement signal for displacing the optical system of the optical head <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a light amount control signal for controlling the light amount of the laser beam and may output such signal or signals to the drive circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in an optical disk formed by the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the information recording face may be divided into shapes of concentric circles and preformatted such that the number of sectors is gradually increased from zones on the inner peripheral side toward zones on the outer peripheral side. Further, the address area AR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be formed at the front of each sector, in which the address of the sector of a succeeding groove and the address of the sector of a succeeding land are recorded in the address area AR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and desired data may be recorded in the succeeding user area AR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, the user area AR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes an interposing gap of 8 byte, a guard of 24 bytes, a VFO of 25 bytes, 2 synchronization bytes, 9672 bytes of user data, a postamble (PA) of 1 byte, a guard of 52 bytes, and a buffer of 16 bytes which may be arranged successively as shown therein. The gap is a region which may be utilized for switching lands and grooves and/or for switching the amount of laser beam. The guard may be used to restrain fluidity of record material by overwriting and promote overwriting cycle of the record area when a so-called phase change media are used as record media. The synchronization byte may be used to lock a PLL circuit in the optical disk device, the postamble may be used in setting the polarity, and the buffer is a redundant area of the record area for absorbing jitter by eccentricity or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a perspective view of an optical disk formed by the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a sectional view showing a section of the optical disk obtained by cutting the optical disk at a portion of a groove. The optical disk may have a thickness of 1.2 (mm) and with the phase change type optical disk, an information recording face may be formed by successively forming an aluminum film, a ZnS&mdash;SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film, a GeSbTe film and a ZnS&mdash;SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>film on a disk substrate. In the case of a magneto-optical disk, an information recording face may be formed by successively forming an aluminum film, a SiN film, a TbFeCo film and an SiN film on a disk substrate. In the case of a write once type disk, an information recording face may be formed by successively forming a film sputtered with aluminum or gold and a predetermined organic pigment film on a disk substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Further, a light transmitting face for transmitting a laser beam and leading the laser beam to the information recording face may be formed on the information recording face and may have a thickness of about 0.1 (mm). Thereby, with such optical disk, even when a laser beam is irradiated from an optical system having a high numerical aperture via the light transmitting face, desired data may be recorded to or reproduced from the information recording face so as to effectively avoid an influence due to skew. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, such optical disk may have a diameter of 120 (mm) and may be arranged such that a region having a radius of from 24 (mm) through 58 (mm) is allocated as a recording region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Further, the optical disk may be stored and held in a predetermined cartridge formed to enable the kind of the optical disk contained therein to be identified and formed to be usable with an optical disk device such that when access is made by the optical system having a high numerical aperture dust or the like may be effectively avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> A phase change type optical disk may be formed so as to enable desired data to be recorded by locally changing the crystal structure of the information recording face by irradiating a laser beam or may be formed to enable recorded data to be reproduced by detecting a change in an amount of return light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Further, in the case of a magneto-optical disk, such disk may be formed such that desired data can be thermomagnetically recorded by applying a magnetic field at the position of irradiating laser beam and such that recorded data can be reproduced by utilizing a magnetic Kerr effect by detecting a plane of polarization of return light. In the case of a write once type disk, such disk may be formed such that desired data can be recorded by locally destructing the information recording face by irradiating a laser beam and such that recorded data can be reproduced by detecting a change in the amount of return light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In these cases, with respect to the optical disk, in respective zones, the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be driven to rotate under a condition of constant angular velocity, the frequency of the wobble signal may be switched successively in steps and the groove may be formed by the wobble signal WEB. As a result, the optical disk is zoned and in each zone, the period of meandering the groove converted into a rotational angle of the optical disk may be formed constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Further, two kinds of optical disks may be fabricated, one where the information recording face is formed only on one face thereof and another where an information recording face is formed on both faces. The optical disk where the Information recording face is formed on both faces thereof may be fabricated by pasting together optical disks which are fabricated from thin disk substrates with a thickness of 1.2 (mm) and a thickness of each light transmitting layer of 0.1 (mm). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a diagram of a processing system of a wobble signal for an optical disk device for making an optical disk mentioned above. According to the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a laser beam may be irradiated from an optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to an optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and return light may be received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> That is, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, in the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may emit a laser beam having a wavelength of 650 (nm) in accordance with a predetermined drive or control signal SL. In a reproducing operation, the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may emit a laser beam with a constant light amount. By contrast, in a recording operation, a laser beam may be emitted while intermittently increasing the light amount and pits or marks may be formed on an information recording device of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by increasing the light amount of laser beam. A collimator lens <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> successive thereto converts the laser beam emitted by the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> into a parallel ray, a shaping lens <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> successive thereto corrects astigmatism of the laser beam and the laser beam is emitted to an object lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> after being transmitted through a beam splitter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The object lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may converge the laser beam onto the information recording face of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and may receive return light therefrom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, when the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is an optical disk exclusively for reproduction, data recorded on the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be reproduced in accordance with a change in an amount of return light. Further, when the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a phase change type optical disk, desired data may be recorded by locally changing the crystal structure at the position of irradiating laser beam and recorded data can be reproduced in accordance with a change in the amount of return light. Further, when the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a write once type optical disk, desired data may be recorded by locally destructing the position of irradiating the laser beam and recorded data can be reproduced in accordance with a change in the amount of return light. By contrast, when the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a magneto-optical disk, a modulation coil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> arranged at the proximity of the object lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be driven by a predetermined drive circuit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and a predetermined modulation magnetic field may be applied at the position of irradiating laser beam by which desired data is recorded by applying a method of thermomagnetic recording and recorded data can be reproduced by detecting a change in a plane of polarization of the return light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The beam splitter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may transmit a laser beam incident from the shaping lens <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and may emit a laser beam to the object lens and, additionally, the beam splitter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may reflect return light incident from the object lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and may separate the optical path and emit return light to a beam splitter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The beam splitter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may separate the return light into two streaks of light fluxes by transmitting and reflecting the return light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Return light reflected by the beam splitter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is incident on a lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which converts the return light, into a converging light flux. A cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provides astigmatism to the return light emitted from the lens <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. An optical detector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> receives return light emitted from the cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The optical detector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can divide a light receiving face into predetermined shapes and can output light receiving results of divided respective receiving faces. Thereby, the optical detector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> may detect a reproducing signal RF where the signal level is changed in accordance with the amount of return light, a push pull signal PP where the signal level is changed in accordance with a displacement of the position of irradiating laser beam in respect of a groove or pit row and a focus error signal FE where the signal level is changed in accordance with a focus amount by converting light receiving results of the respective light receiving faces in current to voltage by a current to voltage converting circuit and thereafter performing addition and subtraction operation by a matrix circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Additionally, return light which has been transmitted through the beam splitter <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be incident on a &frac12; wavelength plate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which may change the plane of polarization of the return light. A lens <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> converts the return light emitted from the &frac12; wavelength plate into converging light flux. A polarized beam splitter <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> reflects a predetermined polarization component and transmits the remaining component by which the light is separated into two streaks of light fluxes where the light amounts are changed complimentarily in accordance with the plane of polarization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Optical detectors <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> respectively receive the two streaks of light fluxes separated by the polarized beam splitter <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and output light receiving results or signals in which the signal levels are changed in accordance with the amounts of receiving light. A differential amplifier <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> outputs a reproducing signal MO having a signal level which may be changed in accordance with the plane of polarization of return light by providing a result of differential amplification by the light receiving results of the two optical detectors <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> via a current to voltage converting circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Thereby, the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can record desired data and reproduce recorded data with various kinds of the optical disks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a sectional view of the object lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As shown therein, the object lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may include a first lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A and a second lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B, in which the first lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A and the second lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B may be formed by nonspherical plastic lenses or glass molds and may be movable by a drive actuator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>D upwardly, downwardly, leftwardly and rightwardly as viewed onto <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Thereby, in the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, tracking control and focus control can be carried out by integrally moving the first lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A and the second lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B. Further, the second lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B on the incident side of a laser beam may be formed with a comparatively large aperture whereas the first lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A on the side of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be formed with a small aperture and respective focal lengths and an interval therebetween may be set to provide a total numerical aperture of 0.78 of the object lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Here, Equation (2) shows a relationship between the skew margin capable of stably providing access to an optical disk and an optical system (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. JP-A-3-225650). A compact disk or the like may have a skew margin &thgr; of about 0.6&deg;. Further, the skew margin &thgr; may be set to 0.4&deg; for a DVD. In the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, even when the thickness of the light transmitting layer is set to 0.1 (mm) and the numerical aperture NA of an optical system is set to a large value, sufficiently stably access can be made to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Further, Equation (3) shows a dispersion of the thickness t of the light transmitting layer allowable to an optical system in which the constant 0.526 is a value calculated in reference to a compact disk. &Dgr;t may have a value of &plusmn;100 (&mgr;m) for a compact disk and &plusmn;30 (&mgr;m) for a DVD. Thereby, in the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, even when the thickness of the light transmitting layer is dispersed, access can be stably made to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may satisfy the following relationship by irradiating a laser beam having a wavelength of 650 (nm) to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via an optical system having a numerical aperture of 0.78: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Incidentally, in the above equation, numeral 4.7 indicates the recording capacity (GB) of DVD) and numeral 0.65 and numeral 0.6 respectively indicate the wavelength of a laser beam and numerical aperture of an optical system for a DVD. Thereby, by using the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a recording capacity of about 8 (GB) can be secured by processing data by a format similar to that of a DVD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> In the object lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the first lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A is arranged so as to project to the side of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and to have a working distance DW for the numerical aperture. Further, characteristics and arrangements of the first lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A and the second lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>B may be selected, the working distance DW may be set to about 560 (&mgr;m) by which according to the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, eccentricity allowance between lens faces, face angle allowance and the radius of curvature of the object lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be set to ranges whereby mass production can be efficiently carried out, the total shape can be downsized and/or collisions with the optical disk can effectively be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> That is, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, when the numerical aperture is increased in the case where the same beam d:diameter of a laser beam is maintained, it is necessary to arrange the object lens proximate to the information recording face of the optical disk by that amount. Incidentally, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the working distance is shown with the thickness of the light transmitting layer as 0. Therefore, if the optical head is arranged to provide a sufficient interval to the optical disk, the beam diameter of laser beam may be increased significantly in comparison with other systems. By contrast, the beam diameter of the laser beam of a DVD system may be about 4.5 (mm), which may be an upper limit value of the present system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> When the optical head is arranged in close proximity to the optical disk, the beam diameter of the laser beam may be reduced by a corresponding amount. In such situation, the shape of the optical system may be reduced. To ensure that high accuracy formation is obtained, the object lens should be accurately fabricated and arranged. Further, the system should be arranged <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to avoid a collision between the optical head and the optical disk. Therefore, according to the present embodiment, the working distance DW is set to about 560 (&mgr;m) and these conditions are satisfied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The lens face of the first lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A on the side of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be formed to have a flat; shape which enables focus control to be readily carried out and even when the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is skewed, the lens may be prevented from colliding with the surface of the light transmitting layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Further, the diameter of the object lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on the side of is the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be reduced in steps and the lens face on the side of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may have a small diameter sufficient for leading a laser beam to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> The modulation coil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be arranged to surround the front end side of the first lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A and such that: the side face on the side of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is substantially flush with the lens face of the first lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A. As such, the modulation coil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is arranged as close as possible to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within a range not projected from the lens face of the first lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A and is capable of applying a modulated magnetic field efficiently at the position of irradiating laser beam. Further, temperature rise due to the modulation coil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be reduced by a heat radiating plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>E arranged on the side of the lens. As a result, various characteristic changes caused by a temperature rise can be restricted to acceptable ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> According to the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), a spindle motor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may drive or rotate the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> under the control of a system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In a normal operational mode, the spindle motor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may drive or rotate the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such that the frequency of a reading/writing clock R/W CK formed by a phase-locked loop (PLL) circuit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> becomes constant by which, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A, 10B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>C, the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be driven or rotated by a so-called &ldquo;Zone Constant Linear Velocity&rdquo; (ZCLV) method. Further, in this case, the ZCLV zoning may correspond to the zoning explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. That is, the spindle motor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may switch the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> successively in steps in accordance with the position of irradiating laser beam (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">Fig. 10A</cross-reference>), by which according to the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the linear speed and the line record density are not significantly varied between the inner peripheral side and the outer peripheral side thereby promoting the record density (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">Figs. 10B and 10C</cross-reference>) and effectively avoiding or preventing a reduction of access speed. By contrast, in a special operational mode such as postrecording or the like, the spindle motor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may drive or rotate the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a predetermined rotational speed under the control of the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> A threading motor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may move the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in a radial direction of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> under control of the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Such motor may enable a seeking operation to be carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> An address detecting circuit <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> may receive the reproducing signal RF having a signal level which may change in accordance with the amount of return light from the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and may binarize the reproducing signal RF. Further, address data ID may be detected from the binarized signal with a synchronization signal allocated to the sector head as a reference and may be outputted to the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the detected timing may also be provided to a cluster counter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Thereby, in the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the position of irradiating laser beam can be specified on the basis of the address data preformatted to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the timing of the sector can be confirmed by the cluster counter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Further, the address detecting circuit <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> may perform error detection processing by use of an error detection code allocated to each address data ID and nay selectively output the address data ID which is determined to be correct. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> A push pull (PP) signal may be supplied from the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to a band-pass filter <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>A of the wobble signal detecting circuit <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> so as to sample or obtain a wobble signal WB. Further, the wobble signal detecting circuit <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> may binarize the wobble signal WB with 0 level as a reference whereby edge information of the wobble signal WB may be sampled in a comparing circuit (COM) <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> A wobbling period detecting circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may receive a binarized signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and may determine whether the wobble signal WB has changed by a correct period by determining or comparing timing of a corresponding edge with the timing of each edge of the binarized signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as a reference. Further, the wobbling period detecting circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may output edge information which has been selectively determined to have a correct period to the PLL circuit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the wobbling period detecting circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may prevent the clock CK from being displaced or adversely affected by dust or the like which may be on the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The binarized signal outputted from the wobbling period detecting circuit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be supplied to a phase comparing circuit (PC) <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>A of the PLL circuit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> so as to compare the phase of the binarized signal with the phase of the clock. CK outputted from a divider <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B. The predetermined clock CK may be obtained and/or outputted from the divider <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B by switching a dividing ratio set by the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> A low frequency component obtained as a result of the phase comparison outputted from the phase comparing circuit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>A may be sampled by a low pass filter (LPF) <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>C and an output therefrom may be supplied to a voltage control type oscillating (VCO) circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>D so as to control the oscillation frequency thereof. Further, an oscillating output of the voltage control type oscillating circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>D may be divided by the divider <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B so as to form the high accuracy clock CK. With regard to the divider <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B, by setting the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in correspondence with zoning which has been explained in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the dividing ratio may be set to successively increase in accordance with the displacement of the position of irradiating laser beam to the outer peripheral side of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thereby, in the PLL circuit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the displacement of the position of irradiating laser beam to the outer peripheral side of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, successively in steps, the frequency of the oscillating output of the voltage control type oscillating circuit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>D may be increased compared with the frequency of the wobble signal WB and the oscillating output may be outputted as the clock R/W CK for writing and reading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> In the normal operational mode of the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, by driving or rotating the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the spindle motor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> such that the frequency of the clock R/W CK for reading and writing becomes constant and by recording desired data with the clock R/W CK for reading and writing as a reference, the line record density may be prevented from changing significantly between the inner peripheral side and the outer peripheral side and, as a result, the record density may be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The cluster counter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> counts the clock R/W CK for reading and writing with the detection result from the address detecting circuit <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> as a reference by which the laser beam irradiating position is specified with high accuracy by referring to the clock R/W CK for reading and writing. Further, based on the result of such counting, the cluster counter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may obtain and/or output a cluster start pulse to the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Here, a cluster is a unit for recording and reproducing data to and from the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the cluster start pulse is a pulse for instructing or identifying the timing or start of the cluster. When the cluster counter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> cannot detect the timing or starting of the sector from the address detecting circuit <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> due to, for example, dust or the like on the surface of the disk, the cluster counter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may interpolate the cluster start pulse by a synchronization processing with the counting result of the clock R/W CK for reading and writing as a reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may include a computer for controlling an operation or operations of the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, such control circuit may control the operation of the threading motor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> or the like on the basis of the successively inputted address data ID and may control an overall operation by switching the operational mode in accordance with the laser beam irradiating position and/or in accordance with an input from an external device. Further, during processing, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may switch the dividing ratio of the divider <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B by use of dividing ratio data stored in a memory <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in accordance with the laser beam irradiating position with the address data ID as a reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may reduce the rotational speed of the optical disk successively in steps from zones on the inner peripheral side toward zones on the outer peripheral side to be in correspondence with the zones Z<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>, Z<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, . . . , Z<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1 </subscript></highlight>and Z<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>explained above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and may cause an equal record density for each sector to be provided in respect of zones on the inner peripheral side and zones on the outer peripheral side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in a special operational mode such as postrecording or the like where recording and reproducing processings are repeated alternately in respect of user data DU<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and DU<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of 2 channels or where the user data DU<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and DU<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of 2 channels are alternately reproduced from the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and are outputted concurrently, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may control the operation of a spindle servo circuit such that the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not switched even if zones are switched for reproducing user data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Thereby, in the case where recording and reproducing processings are alternately repeated, in the reproducing operation, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may reproduce user data DU at the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a recording operation immediately before the reproducing operation even when zones are switched. Further, in the case where the user data DU<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and DU<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of 2 channels are alternately reproduced from the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and outputted concurrently, one user data may be reproduced from the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a state where the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is driven to rotate at the rotational speed in reproducing the other user data. Further, in these cases, with regard to a channel on the recording side and a channel on other reproducing side, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may record and reproduce the user data by driving the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to rotate at a rotational speed twice that which may he set with respect of the corresponding zones by applying the ZCLV method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> During operation of the optical disk device, a time period may be necessary to stabilize the rotational speed when the rotational speed of the optical disk is switched. Accordingly, the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may switch a recording and reproducing operation only with await time or the like reeded for locking the PLL circuit in a period of time which may be significantly shorter than that in switching the rotational speed by omitting the time period necessary for switching the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this case, the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be set to about twice the rotational speed in the normal operational mode in the ZCLV control applied to a channel on the recording side and a channel on the other reproducing side. Thereby, in processing user data of <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> channels, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may record and reproduce the user data DU to and from the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at high speed and intermittently and a time period sufficient for seeking operation or the like or processing of the other channel can be realized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing a processing involved in the setting of the rotational speed of the optical disk in the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. According to the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, when a user selects the operational mode, the operation proceeds from step SP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to step SP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> where a determination is made as to whether the operational mode selected by the user is the above-described operational mode of post recording or the like and when a negative result is obtained, the operation proceeds step SP<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Here, according to the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, after setting the operational mode of the spindle servo circuit to a ZCLV operational mode, the operation proceeds to step SP<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the processing procedure is finished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the operational mode selected by the user is the above-described operational mode of postrecording or the like, as indicated by an affirmative result in step SP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the operation of the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> proceeds to step SP<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Here, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> stops stitching the rotational speed (that is, sets operational mode to CAV) as, for example, that which may occur with respect to a channel on the reproducing side when 2 channels are respectively recorded and reproduced and with respect to either channel when 2 channels are respectively reproduced. The operation of the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may then proceed to step SP<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> so as to set the ZCLV operational mode at the above-described rotational speed for the spindle control of a remaining channel and thereafter, the operation proceeds to step SP<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> whereupon the processing is terminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In the state where the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is controlled as described above, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may allocate data of 1 cluster to 4 continuous sectors with the address areas AR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> set to the respective sectors as references by executing control of writing and reading in accordance with the cluster start pulse outputted from the cluster counter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may increase the numbers of clusters successively allocated to respective zones from zones on the inner peripheral side toward zones or the outer peripheral side. Further, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may instruct or control a tracking servo circuit to switch the movable direction of the object lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in respect of the polarity of the tracking error signal by which the scanning of a laser beam is controlled to switch between a groove and a land between grooves.

<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the recording and reproducing circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may form an ECC data block (182 bytes&times;208 bytes) by <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the sector data blocks. That is, the recording and reproducing circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may arrange <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the sector data blocks each comprising 2048 bytes&plus;16 bytes by a unit of 172 bytes successively in the order of raster scanning and form error correction code (PI) comprising inner code in the horizontal direction and error correction code (PO) comprising outer code in the vertical direction. Furthermore, the recording and reproducing circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may interleave the ECC block and form a frame structure shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. That is, the recording and reproducing circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may allocate a frame synchronizing signal (FS) of 2 bytes to each 91 bytes of the ECC data block of <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> bytes&times;208 bytes thereby forming 412 frames by one ECC data block. The recording and reproducing circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may form data of 1 cluster having the frame structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and may allocate the one cluster to 4 continuous sectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> The recording and reproducing circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may set the redundancy to 23 (%) or less and may efficiently record the user data by adding redundant data such as the frame synchronizing signal, error correction code, the frame address and so on to the user data. In this way, a redundancy of 23 (%) (which is similar to that in a DVD system) still ensures sufficient recording capacity. Incidentally, increasing the redundancy to more than 23 (%) only unnecessarily aid the error correction function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Further, by forming the ECC data block by the user data of 32 (KB), an interval between codes in the error correction processing can sufficiently be secured and the error correction function can be strengthened by that amount. Additionally, the recording or reproducing processing may be carried out with the ECC data block as a unit and as a whole, the processing of recording or reproducing or processing of postrecording or the like can be executed by simple processings. </paragraph>

Further, the outputting operation may be carried out with the writing/reading clock R/W CK as a reference. In the normal operational mode, the data may be converted into the user data DU and outputted at data transmitting speed of 11.08 (Mbps) by which the user data DU is intermittently outputted at a transmitting speed higher than that of the user data DU inputted from the encoder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The recording and reproducing circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may intermittently record the user data DU and can enable a seek operation involving the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to be performed by utilizing extra idle time and can record discretely the continuous user data by the seeking operation. </paragraph>

In this way, by repeating a recording and reproducing operation with the cluster as a unit, the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can execute reproduction of data recorded on the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, editing processing and recording reproduced data and processing such as postrecording or the like. </paragraph>

The clock may be reproduced by the reproducing signals RF and MO with the binarized signal as a reference. In this way, the reproduced clock corresponds to the reading/writing clock R/W CK. Further, reproduced data may be detected by successively latching the binarized signal with the reproduced clock as a reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> The recording and reproducing circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may form decoded data by decoding the reproduced data by applying a PRLM (Partial-Response Maximum-Likelihood) method.

In this case, in the recording and reproducing circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, a reproduction clock may be provided with a frequency in correspondence with the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and reproduction data provided from the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be processed with use of the reproduction clock. The reproduction clock may correspond to the reading/writing clock R/W CK formed by the PLL circuit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and accordingly, in this case, the frequency of the reading/writing clock R/W CK may be changed in accordance with the position of irradiating laser beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Thus, by using the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the frequency of switching the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be reduced and access speed may be improved. </paragraph>

Here, multichannel processing may be processing involving the simultaneous recording or reproducing of 2 channels of video signals and audio signals. In this case, according to the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be set to a rotational speed twice the normal rotational speed and 2 channels of video signals and audio signals may be recorded or reproduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> When the user selects a multichannel record mode, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may process 2 channels of video signals and audio signals by the encoder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, form 2 channels of continuous user data DU<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and DU<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and successively input the user data DU<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and DU<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</cross-reference>).

When the amount of data in the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is a predetermined value or less in respect of the user data which starts recording, recording to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be interrupted. Further, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may make the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> seek and wait at a record start position of the other channel (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) and the user data held in the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be similarly recorded in the other channel (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>D<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> The system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may alternately repeat the series of processings and may alternately carry out a recording operation to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> while inputting 2 channels of the continuous user data to the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In this case, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may grasp a recording time period of the two video signals and audio signals in accordance with an input of the user or the like and may secure previously continuous regions for the respective channels and make the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> carry out a seeking operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> In contrast thereto, when the user selects a multichannel reproduction mode, in a manner similar to that of the recording operation, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may make the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> seek, may control access to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> whereby 2 channels of user data are intermittently reproduced from the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and held in the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and may output the 2 channels of user data held in the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> after decoding it continuously by the decoder <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> Even in the multichannel reproduction mode, with respect to one of the channels, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may maintain the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a rotational speed of the other channel by which the frequency of switching the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be reduced and the access speed improved. </paragraph>

In this case, the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be utilized with a number of external devices such that, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, successively reproduced video signal and audio signal (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</cross-reference>) may be monitored by a monitor <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> and a speaker <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight> and audio signal or the like inputted from a microphone <highlight><bold>954</bold></highlight> or the like may be mixed with the reproduced video signal and audio signal and successively inputted (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> In this mode, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may set the data transmitting speed to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to twice those in the normal mode. The optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be made to seek to a reproducing start position of a program selected by the user (FIGS. <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and reproduction of the user data DU may be started from the position. Further, the reproduced user data may be stored in the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the stored user data may be outputted via the decoder <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). When a predetermined amount of the user data is stored in the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may interrupt reproduction and make the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> seek to a position of starting reproduction (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) . Here, the reproduced user data may be processed by an external device and successively stored in the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by which the user data stored in the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be recorded to e corresponding portion of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by, for example, overwriting (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>D<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). Thereby, when the amount of user data on the record side or the amount of user data on the reproduction side stored in the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is a predetermined value or less, the user data may be reproduced from a portion where the reproduction is interrupted and these control operations are repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may reproduce the user data DU intermittently from the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and may again record intermittently the user data processed by an external device to the portion of reproducing the user data DU. Incidentally, even in the postrecording operation, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may maintain the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a rotational speed of a channel on the record side in respect to a channel on the reproduction side by which the frequency of switching the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be reduced and access speed improved. </paragraph>

In this case, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> successively heads out respective programs recorded to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and reproduces them for predetermined periods through determination by file control data recorded in a read-in area of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. That is, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may make the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> seek to head out in accordance with file control data (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</cross-reference>), and start reproduction of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the head-out portion (FIGS. <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>B). Further, the reproduced user data may be outputted via the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</cross-reference>). In this case, when a sufficient amount of user data is stored in the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> after an elapse of a predetermined time period, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> heads out a succeeding program by making the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> seek (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), and reproduces data of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the head-out portion after having awaited reduction of the amount of user data in the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to a predetermined value or less (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>A<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). The system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may repeat these processings and reproduce respective programs recorded on the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by successively heading them out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is a diagram for explaining access to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in recording and reproducing continuous data under control of the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may switch object from zones on the inner peripheral side to zones on the outer peripheral side on the basis of the address data ID detected by the address detecting circuit <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), and may successively record continuous data or reproduce continuous data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> When the access object is switched from a zone on the inner peripheral side to a zone Zm on the outer peripheral side by controlling the threading motor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may control the overall operation such that after starting access from a groove on the innermost periphery as designated by notation G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, access is made tc a track formed by grooves up to the outermost periphery of the zone Zm as designated by notation G<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Successively, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may provide a track jump instruction as designated by notation J, may switch the access object to a track formed by lands on the innermost periphery of the zone Zm and control the operation such that access is made from the track formed by lands on the innermost periphery to the track formed by lands on the outermost periphery of the zone Zm (notation L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> Thereby, in driving the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by ZCLV in a range where the rotational speed is maintained constant, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may record the continuous user data DU with respect to the range and when recording is difficult in respect of the range, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may record the user data DU at succeeding regions on the outer peripheral side. Thus, in optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the frequency of switching the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be reduced as less as possible and access speed promoted by that amount. In this case, within the range where the rotational speed is maintained constant, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may initially record successively the user data DU to the track formed by grooves from the inner peripheral side to the outer peripheral side and, when the recording is finished, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may record successively the user data to the track formed by lands whereby the frequency of seeking of the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may also be reduced and the access speed is improved thereby. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> When the access is finished in respect of one zone as described above, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may switch access object to a succeeding zone on the outer peripheral side and start recording the succeeding user data DU from the track formed by grooves of the zone on the outer peripheral side. Thereby, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may control the total operation such that access is started from the track formed by grooves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> In the meantime, when access is made to an optical disk by an optical head having a relatively high numerical aperture such as that described in this embodiment, the recording and reproducing characteristic or performance may be deteriorated or adversely affected by dust or the like on the surface of the disk. According to a result of an experiment, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, with a numerical aperture 0.8, a burst error may be caused even by dust having a small particle size (such as by dust of 100 (&mgr;m) or more). As a result, a bit error rate may increase even when small dust particles or the like adhere to the surface of the disk. Therefore, the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be stored and held in a cartridge as hereinbelow described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> In recording data to an optical disk, data transmitting rates may vary within an optical disk device. For example, and with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference>, the rate at which data is transmitted into and/or from a buffer memory <highlight><bold>992</bold></highlight> may be less than the rate at which data is transmitted from a modulator <highlight><bold>994</bold></highlight> for supply to an optical head <highlight><bold>996</bold></highlight> so as to be recorded onto an optical disk <highlight><bold>990</bold></highlight>. That is, the rate at which data is transmitted into and/or from the buffer memory <highlight><bold>992</bold></highlight> may be approximately 10 Mbps or 11.08 Mbps and the rate at which data is transmitted from the modulator <highlight><bold>994</bold></highlight> may be 15 Mbps. A similar arrangement may also apply during a reproduction operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is a disassembled perspective view of a cartridge for storing the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. According to this embodiment, the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is stored and held in a cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> such that the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is difficult to take out and the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is loaded to the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in such state. Incidentally, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25, a</cross-reference> shutter has been removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be arranged with sheet members <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on both faces thereof and stored between an upper case <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and a lower case <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The sheet members <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be formed by punching out unwoven cloth in a substantially circular disk shape and the unwoven cloth may be formed by fibre the surface of which is formed with very small irregularities. Thereby, when the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is rotated in the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, dust or the like on the surface of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be adsorbed to or removed by the sheet members <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> such that both faces of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be cleaned by the sheet members <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> Further, the sheet members <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be formed with a diameter larger than diameter of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (designated by hatching in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>) and the surroundings thereof may be adhered to by an adhesive agent or the like to surround the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the sheet members <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be formed in a bag-like shape for storing the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> inside thereof so as to protect the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such that dust or the like which may invade the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> does not adhere to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> easily. Further, the sheet members <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be formed with notches at the vicinity of the center of rotation of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and extending therefrom to the outer peripheral side thereof. The optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can chuck the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by way of the notches <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>A at the vicinity of the center of rotation and access can be made to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by the notches <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>B which extend from the center of rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> In this case, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, the notches <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>A at the vicinity of the center of rotation may have a size necessary for chucking the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Further, the notches <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>B extending from the vicinity of the center of rotation may have a size necessary for the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to have access to the optical disk and the notches may be formed in shapes such that even when the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> seeks in the case where the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> makes access to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a small working distance, the first lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A of the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and constituent parts of the modulation coil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the like and the optical disk are not brought into contact with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> In this way, the sheet members <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may cover the surface of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> except in the vicinity of the center of rotation of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a range where incidence of laser beam is not hampered whereby the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is prevented from being exposed as much as possible. Further, when the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has only one information recording face, the appropriate one of the sheet member <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be formed with only the notch at the vicinity of the center of rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> The upper case <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the lower case <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be formed by molding resin by injection-molding with openings <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>A formed at the vicinity of the center of rotation of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and extending from the vicinity of the center of rotation to the outer peripheral direction of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in correspondence with the notches <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>B or <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>B of the sheet members <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. As such, an opening is formed to enable the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be chucked or properly seated and to allow the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to be arranged or to move from the vicinity of the center of rotation to the outer peripheral of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the openings in the upper and lower cases from the center of rotation to the outer peripheral direction of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be formed with a width wider than those of the notches <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>B of the sheet members <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Further, when the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has only one information recording face, an opening may be formed only at the vicinity of the center of rotation of the appropriate one of the upper case <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the lower case <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> Further, the upper case <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the lower case <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are arranged with pressing members <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at the vicinity of the openings <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>A and on the sides of the information recording face(s) of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The sheet members <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> may be pressed to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by the pressing member <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the pressing member <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The pressing members <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be formed by bending metal plates in a spring-like shape. As a result, the cleaning of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by the sheet members <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Further, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, the upper case <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the lower case <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may have identification regions <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>B at corners thereof. A number of recess portions <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> each having a rectangular shape may be formed at the identification regions <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>B in accordance with the type or kind of optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> held inside. Thereby, according to the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the kind of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be simply identified.

<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 through 35</cross-reference> are plane views of other movability restricting mechanisms. Another movability restricting mechanism may be formed symmetrically with the one movability restricting mechanism explained in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 through 32</cross-reference> as shown by substituting suffixes of corresponding notations. Thereby, when a disk having two recording/reproducing surfaces is stored, the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be reversed and loaded in the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Such loading can be carried out simply and similar to that of an optical disk having only of one recording/reproducing surface. Further, either the one or two recording/reproducing surface disk can be loaded by a common loading mechanism into the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further, the operation of such movability restricting mechanism may be similar to that of the previously described movability restricting mechanism until restriction on pivoting the second stopper <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>B is released. In such situation, as shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>, the button <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>B may be pressed by the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and the shutter slid or moved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> Thereby, with the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, invasion of dust or the like caused by erroneous operation of the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> can effectively be avoided by the triple safety mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing a relationship between the movability restricting mechanism and the loading mechanism of the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.

Projections or pressing members <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>B may be arranged on the inner side faces of the tray <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> such that when the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is slid to a predetermined position on the tray <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, the buttons <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>B are pressed by the projections <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Further, in the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, two rollers <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may be arranged at inner portions of the tray <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and attached to front ends of arms supported by predetermined pivoting shafts and, as shown by an arrow mark G, urged to the side of the tray <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. When the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is slid to a predetermined position, in a state where the buttons <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>B are pressed, the roller <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with the button <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>A and an end portion of the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and the roller <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with the button <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>B and the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. When the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is slid further, the roller <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> presses the button <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>A and slides the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and the roller <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is pressed to rotate by the button <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>B and the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> by which, as shown by an arrow mark H, the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> may be moved such that the openings are exposed. When the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is completely opened in this way, the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may approach the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from the lower side of the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (as viewed in the drawing) and, thereafter, focus searching and other processing may be carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> In contrast thereto, when the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is discharged, the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is pressed by the roller <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> which has been pivoted by being pressed by the button <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>B and the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in a loading operation, by which the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> returns to the original state. Alternatively, the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> can be returned to the original state by a spring installed at the inside of the cartridge even with only the roller <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> Further, when a disk having only a single recording/reproducing surface is arranged in the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the cartridge including the upper case <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the lower case <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> may be formed such that sliding of the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in one direction is restricted so that erroneous charging can effectively be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference> shows a relationship between the identification region <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>B or <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>B and the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may have a disk discriminator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> formed by a plurality of switches <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>D and arranged in correspondence with the recess portions <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the identification region <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>B. The switches <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>D mZLy perform ON/OFF operation(s) respectively in accordance with the presence or absence of the recess portions <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in the identification region <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>B and may output <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> values of discrimination signals obtained by the ON/OFF operation(s) to the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> When the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is inserted into the above-described tray <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> loads the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by driving a predetermined drive mechanism and determines the kind or type of optical disk stored in the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with the discrimination signal of the disk discriminator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> as a reference. Further, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may load a corresponding reference laser beam amount held in the memory <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> based on the discrimination result and set the drive condition of the laser drive circuit <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in accordance with the reference laser beam amount. Here, the memory <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may hold reference laser beam amounts for various kinds of the optical disks in addition to the above-described dividing ratio of the divider <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in a writing operation, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may irradiate the laser beam L to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by the reference beam amount in correspondence with the kind of optical disk, set the final laser beam amount for writing from a result of irradiating the laser beam L and apply a modulation magnetic field at the position of irradiating the laser beam by driving the modulation coil drive circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>E when the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a magneto-optical type disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> In the mastering device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), by irradiating the laser beam L in a spiral shape from the inner peripheral side toward the outer peripheral side by driving the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to rotate, the groove may be formed with intervals of about 1.0 (&mgr;m) and its shape may meander in accordance with the wobble signal WB. Further, the spot shape and the light amount of the laser beam L may be set such that intervals between grooves formed by exposure of the laser beam L and contiguous grooves are substantially equal on the optical disk so that lands and grooves can be recorded with grooves as references. A data capacity of <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (GB) or more can be obtained by recording on lands and grooves with a line record density of about 0.21 (&mgr;m/bit) using the grooves as references. Thereby, the mastering device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can record 8 (GB) or more of data to an optical disk fabricated by the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by effectively utilizing the information recording face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> In the mastering device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the value of the address data ID (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference>) may be successively varied in accordance with the rotation of the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by the address signal forming circuit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and data allocated to the address area AR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be formed by adding synchronization data or the like to the address data ID. After modulating and synthesizing the data with the wobble signal WB at the synthesizing circuit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the data may be supplied to the drive circuit <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. As a result, in the mastering device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, meandering of the groove may be interrupted at predetermined angular intervals, address data by pit row may be recorded onto the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the sector structure may be arranged by radially dividing the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at predetermined angular intervals with the address data at the front. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> In this way, in the optical disk formed by the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the sector structure may be formed and access can be provided with the address data as a reference and with each sector as a unit and the access speed may be promoted accordingly. Further, even when the address data cannot be reproduced correctly due to dust or the like, access may be correctly provided to each sector by interpolation with the meandering of groove as a reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, even when information is recorded with high density, the redundancy can be set low and the address recorded on the optical disk can be detected by effectively utilizing the information recording face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> When the sector structure is formed in this way,according to the mastering device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, by switching the frequency of the wobble signal WB, the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may have zones in shapes of concentric circles and pit rows may be formed such that the number of sectors is successively increased from zones on the inner peripheral side to zones on the outer peripheral side. As a result, access may be provided to the optical disk by applying the zone CLV method in correspondence with the zoning, the information recording face can be utilized efficiently and the access speed can be promoted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> Further, in this case, the land area AR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be divided into front and rear regions and address data of a sector formed by succeeding grooves and a sector formed by succeeding lands may be respectively allocated thereto whereby even when data is recorded with high density by land and groove recording, address data can be reproduced so as to effectively avoid cross talk from a contiguous track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> In this way, an optical disk may be fabricated by the sector structure from the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> fabricated by the mastering device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> In the optical disk (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), the light transmitting layer for transmitting a laser beam and leading the laser beam to the information recording face may be formed on the information recording face with a thickness of about 0.1 (mm). As such, even when the laser beam is irradiated from an optical system having a relatively high numerical aperture via the light transmitting layer, the relationships of Equation (2) and Equation (3) may be satisfied and desired data may be recorded and reproduced to and from the information recording face so as to effectively avoid an influence due to skew. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> With regard to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, processing of spindle control or the like may be executed with meandering of a groove formed as previously described as a reference in the optical disk device. In the PLL circuit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the clock CK with high accuracy with the meandering of a groove as a reference may be formed and the timing of a sector(s) may be detected by the cluster counter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). In the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (see also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>), a laser beam may be irradiated from the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, return light may be received by the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the reproducing signal RF in which the signal level thereof may be changed in accordance with the amount of return light, the reproducing signal MO in which the signal level thereof may be changed in accordance with the plane of polarization of return light, the push pull signal PP in which the signal level thereof may be changed in accordance with the displacement of the laser beam irradiating position in respect of a groove or pit row and the focus error signal FE in which the signal level thereof may be changed in accordance with a focus amount may be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> In this case, by irradiating a laser beam having a wave length of 650 (nm) or less via the object lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> having a numerical aperture of 0.70 or more in which the working distance DW is set to 560 (&mgr;m) or less, relatively high density recording can be carried out with a spot size approximately half that of a DVD. In this way, a record capacity of about 8 (GB) or more may be obtained with efficient PRML channel coding and wherein the redundancy may be decreased by use of an efficient premastered address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> Further, in this case by setting the working distance to 560 (&mgr;m) or less, the radius of curvature of lens, the allowance of eccentricity between the lens faces and the allowance of the face angle may be set to practical ranges or values by which an optical system can be formed with a lens having a small aperture and a laser beam can be made incident on the object lens with a beam diameter of approximately 4.5 (mm) or less. Thereby,the head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be fabricated with sufficient accuracy so as to avoid a collision involving the object lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> The wobble signal WB may be sampled from the push pull signal PP detected as described above in the wobble signal detecting circuit <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and the edge information may be sampled by binarizing the wobble signal WB. Further, in the PLL circuit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the binarized signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having the edge information may be synchronized with the output signal CK of the divider <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B with regard to the phase by which the reading/writing clock R/W CK is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> In this case, by forming the wobble signal WB by a carrier signal having a single frequency according to the edge information provided by binarization, each edge information may be provided with correct phase information. Thereby, the reading/writing clock R/W CK having high accuracy may be formed by synchronizing with the edge information with regard to phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> Further, the reading/writing clock R/W CK may be counted by the cluster counter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> with the frame synchronization timing detected from the address area AR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by the address detecting circuit <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> as a reference by which the timing of writing or reading in the recording and reproducing circuit <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may be set. In this case, by setting the timing with the clock R/W CK having high accuracy as a reference, the timing of writing or the like can be set in the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by determining the position of irradiating laser beam with high accuracy. Accordingly, user data can be recorded to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with high density by utilizing the information recording face of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> In this case, even when correct timing of frame synchronization is difficult to detect by the address detecting circuit <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> due to the influence of dust or the like, by counting the clock R/W CK outputted from the PLL circuit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> by the cluster counter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, correct timing can be detected so that desired data may be recorded or reproduced with high density by an optical system having a relatively high numerical aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> In processing the wobble signal WB, in the PLL circuit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the dividing ratio of the divider <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>B may be switched in accordance with the position of the irradiating laser beam whereby the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is driven to rotate by ZCLV. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> The period of meandering groove may be constant in each region in conversion to the rotational angles and the synchronization of the PLL circuit <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be swiftly formed in each zone and the access speed can be promoted. Further, by forming the meandering of a groove at a constant period in it conversion to the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, influence from a contiguous track can effectively be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> In this way, the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">Fig. 1</cross-reference>) may control the timing of recording or reproducing such that in a recording operation video and audio signals may be converted into the user data DU by being subjected to data compression by a format prescribed in MPEG at the encoder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the user data DU may be modulated with the predetermined unit or ECC block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> Further, when the laser disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a magneto-optical disk and when the amount of laser beam is intermittently increased by timing in synchronism with the reading/writing clock R/W CK by the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a modulation magnetic field may be applied at the position of the irradiating laser beam by the modulation coil drive circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in accordance with modulated data of ECC block whereby the user data DU may be recorded with a line record density of 0.21 (&mgr;m/bit) by successively forming marks having a maximum run length of <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>T and a minimum run length of <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>T by the shortest record mark 4/3 bit by use of a thermomagnetic recording method such that approximately 3 hours of video and audio signals may be continuously recorded. Additionally, the video and audio signals may be recorded efficiently with a redundancy of 23 (%) or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Further, by successively recording video and audio signals to the optical disk with a unit of ECC data block of 32 (KB), an interval between codes in error correction processing can sufficiently be secured and the bit error rate may be improved. Further, by recording and reproducing with the unit of ECC data block, data processing may be simplified in a special reproduction mode as in alternately exchanging recording and reproducing processings and in the case where data is recorded discretely by interposing seeking operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> In these cases, when the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is of a phase change type or a write once type, the amount of laser beam may be switched intermittently by the laser drive circuit <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> at the timing in synchronism with the reading/writing clock R/W CK and in accordance with ECC block data modulated by (1, 7) RLL modulation whereby similar pit row is formed and the user data DU is recorded with line record density of 0.21 (&mgr;m/bit) or with the shortest mark length or the shortest pit length 0.3 (&mgr;m) or less and video and audio signals are recorded continuously for 3 hours. Thereby, the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may provide a recording time period similar to that of a video tape recorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> Further, data may be recorded to the optical disk by land and groove recording by which video and audio signals can efficiently be recorded by effectively utilizing the information recording face. Such recording may be carried out with a track pitch of approximately 0.5 (&mgr;m). Video and audio signals of 3 hours may be recorded on one side of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> In the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the use:r data DU of 1 ECC block may be successively allocated and recorded to 4 sectors and the record start timing can be accurately detected by the clock having high accuracy and correct timing can be detected by interpolation even with the presence of dust or the like so that high density recording may be performed even by an optical system having a high numerical aperture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> In contrast thereto, in a reproducing operation, the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may detect a corresponding sector as in a recording operation. After binarizing the reproducing signal RF or MO obtained from the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the reproduction clock may be formed, the reproducing data may be obtained with the reproduction clock as a reference and the reproducing data may be decoded and outputted. The reproducing signal MO obtained from the magneto-optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may have a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio smaller than that of the reproducing signal RF obtained from pit row. Meanwhile, the address area AR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by pit row may be formed radially in each zone and, accordingly, cross talk from pit row to the reproducing signal MO can effectively be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> When access is made to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by use of the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the user data may be inputted and outputted to and from the encoder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the decoder <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> via the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having a relatively large capacity and the user data may be intermittently recorded to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a data transmitting speed of 11.08 (Mbps) which is faster than the data transmitting speed in the encoder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the decoder <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the user data may be discretely recorded in a cluster unit(s), sufficient seek time period can be secured, and further, even when detracking may be caused by vibration or the like, continuous video and audio signals can be recorded and reproduced with no interruption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> Further, when follow-up reproduction, multichannel mode and postrecording mode are selected in which 2 channels of video and audio signals are simultaneously processed by the user, the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be switched to a rotational speed twice the normal rotational speed. Thereby, in recording and reproducing continuous video and audio signals intermittently to and from the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by use of the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, sufficient idle time can be secured between accesses to the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the idle time may be allocated to recording and reproduction of another channel or a seeking operation involving the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> whereby 2 channels of video signals and audio signals are simultaneously processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> In follow-up reproduction, 1 channel of video and audio signals may be intermittently recorded to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and, during this period, another channel of video and audio signals may be intermittently reproduced from the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Further, the 2 channels of video signals and audio signals to be recorded or reproduced may be continuously inputted and outputted to and from an external device via the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> In multichannel mode, and in particular in a recording operation thereof, 2 channels of video signals and audio signals may be continuously inputted from external devices via the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and the 2 channels of video signals and audio signals may be recorded to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> alternately and intermittently. On the other hand, in a reproducing operation thereof, the 2 channels of video signals and audio signals may be reproduced from the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> alternately and intermittently and may be outputted continuously to external devices via the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> In postrecording, 1 channel of video and audio signals may be intermittently reproduced from the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and outputted continuously to an external device via the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Further, video and audio signals which have been processed by the external device may be continuously inputted to the memory <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the video and audio signals may be intermittently recorded to original recording positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> Thereby, the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be as easy to use as a videotape recorder and may have superior performance compared to a tape recorder such as by use of a random access function particular to an optical disk. In providing such access to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, there is a concern that since the thickness of the light transmitting layer is set to 0.1 (mm) by an optical system having a high numerical aperture, the signal levels of the reproducing signals RF and MO may be changed due to small dust or the like piled up on the surface of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> whereby the error rate is adversely affected. As a result, the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>) may be stored in the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> such that the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is difficult to take out and is loaded to the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> so as to avoid the adhesion of dust or the like to a surface of the optical disk. Further, in the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is stored within sheet members <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> formed in a bag-like shape in which the sheet members <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are pressed by the pressing members <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and wherein, clearances between the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and the uppercase <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the lower case <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are blocked by the damping members <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>D and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>D whereby adhesion of dust or the like is effectively avoided. Further, the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (as illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) may be constituted such that the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is not slid unless after releasing restriction of movement of the second stoppers <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>B by the first stoppers <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>B by pressing the buttons <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>B arranged at side faces, theme shed state between the second stopper <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>A or <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>B and the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is released by pressing the button <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>A or <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>B whereby the openings <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>A are prevented from being exposed by erroneous operation of the user and invasion of dust or the like dust by such an erroneous operation car effectively be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference>, when the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is arranged on the tray <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be slid on the tray <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> by driving a drive mechanism by the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the buttons <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>B of the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be pressed by the projections <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>B formed at the tray <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, in respect of the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the button <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>A may be pressed by the roller <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> may be pressed such that the shutter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is slid and the openings <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>A are exposed, and the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be advanced to the openings <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>A whereby loading of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> In the above state, the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may detect the presence or absence of the recess portions <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> by the disk discriminator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</cross-reference>) in the identification region <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>B or <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>B formed in the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which may correspond to the information recording face of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so as to determine the kind of the information recording face. Further, the setting of the switch <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may provide an indication as to whether a write prohibition or inhibit has been set regarding the information recording face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> Thereby, in the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, when the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a magneto-optical disk, the operation of the modulation coil drive circuit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the laser drive circuit <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> may be started and the user data DU is thermomagnetically recorded to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Further, when the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a phase change type or a write once type, the operation of the laser drive circuit <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> may be started and the user data DU recorded by mark row or pit row. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> In the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the laser beam L may be irradiated to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by an amount of reference laser beam in accordance with the kind of each optical disk held in the memory <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and an optimal beam amount may be set on the basis of the result of irradiating the laser beam L. Thereby, in the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, desired data can be recorded to various kinds of the optical disks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> Further, in the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), when access is made to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by an optical system having a high numerical aperture while applying a modulation magnetic field to the optical disk where the thickness of the light transmitting layer is set to 0.1 (mm) by the modulation coil <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> arranged on the side of the object lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, various data can be recorded not only to an optical disk of a phase change type or an optical disk of a write once type but a magneto-optical disk whereby the range of application of the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is significantly expanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> Further, when 2 channels of signals are processed with the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in respect of a channel on the recording side, the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be controlled by ZCLV such that the rotational speed is twice the rotational speed in a normal mode, whereas in respect of another channel on the reproducing side, user data may be reproduced at the rotational speed of a channel on the recording side immediately there before. Thereby, in the optical disk device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, when access is made to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> alternately in respect of a plurality of channels, the frequency of switching the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be reduced and the access speed promoted by that amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the above-described device, by recording user data (such as video and audio signals) by irradiating a laser beam having a wavelength of 650 (nm) or less via the object lens <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> having a numerical opening or aperture of 0.70 or more in which the working distance is set to 560(&mgr;m) or less, 8 (GB) of data can be recorded with selected data processing. Moreover, such device may be relatively easy to use and may provide functions unavailable with a tape recorder/player. Further, the optical head <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be fabricated with sufficient accuracy to effectively avoid a collision with the optical disk or the like. Further, user data may be recorded with a line record density of 0.21 (&mgr;m/bit) and at the shortest record mark length or the shortest pit length of 0.3 (&mgr;m) or less and the user data may be recorded by land and groove recording with a track pitch of 0.5 (&mgr;m) whereby 8(GB) of data can be recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> Further, the transmitting speed of the user data between an optical disk and a buffer memory may be set to 11.08(Mbps) and, as such, may be made faster than the transmitting speed of the user data between the decoder or the encoder and the buffer memory by which a continuous video signal can be recorded and reproduced while securing a time period sufficient for a seeking operation or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> Further, user data can efficiently be recorded with a redundancy lower than 23 (%) or that of a DVD system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> Further, by satisfying the relationship &Dgr;t&lE;&plusmn;5.26&times;(&lgr;/NA<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>) (&mgr;gm) involving the dispersion At of the thickness of the light transmitting layer, the numerical aperture NA and the wavelength &lgr;, the video signal and audio signal can be recorded with high density and can be properly recorded and reproduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> Further, the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be stored into the cartridge <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> so that the influence of dust can be reduced whereby deterioration in the recording and reproducing characteristic caused by dust or the like can effectively be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> Further, the rotational speed of the optical disk may be switched successively in steps and access provided to the optical disk by ZCLV. Furthermore, a plurality of sectors may be arranged in one turn of a track and address information may be recorded to the front of each sector in which a video signal is recorded by efficiently using the information recording face of the optical disk and deterioration in the access speed can effectively be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> Further, the information recording face of the optical disk may be efficiently used by use of land and groove recording by which the record density can be promoted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> Further, by making the transmitting speed of the user data between the optical disk and the buffer memory twice the transmitting speed of the user data between the decoder or the encoder and the buffer memory, access may be made to the optical disk intermittently and spare idle time may be effectively utilized such that concurrent processing of a plurality of channels or the like can be executed and the easiness of use of the optical disk device can be accordingly promoted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> Further, user data may be recorded and reproduced in a unit or units of ECC data block(s) and the ECC data block may have 32KB or more in which a sufficient interval between codes can be secured in error correction processing and EL sufficient error correction function can be provided. By recording and reproducing the user data to and from the optical disk in a unit(s) of ECC data block(s), concurrent processing of 2 channels or the like can be executed in a simplified manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the present invention will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> is a diagram of a mastering device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> according to another embodiment of the present invention. In fabricating an optical disk, an original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be exposed by the mastering device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and an optical disk fabricated from the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Incidentally, this embodiment may utilize a number of elements which may be similar to those used in the previous embodiment. Such similar elements have the same notation and a duplicated explanation thereof will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> A track constituted by a groove in a spiral shape having a track pitch of 1.0 (&mgr;m) may be formed by the mastering device <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Further, when an optical disk is fabricated from the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the laser beam L may be irradiated such that widths of a groove and a land are substantially equal. Furthermore, the groove may meander due to wobble data ADIP formed by a wobble data forming circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> Thereby, in this embodiment, in place of pit row, address information may be preformatted by a meandering groove. Further, positional information with high accuracy can be obtained even when the address is preformatted by meandering groove so that a record capacity similar to that of the previous embodiment may be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> According to the wobble data forming circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a timing signal (which may be a frequency generated FG signal or the like) in synchronism with the rotation of original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be received by a spindle motor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or the like and the timing signal counted by a predetermined counter by which a frame number sync no the value of which may be varied successively circulatingly at a period of, for example, {fraction (1/16)} rotation of the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a track number (track no) the value of which may be varied every time the position of irradiating the laser beam L is displaced by 1 track in correspondence with the change in the frame number sync no may be formed. Thereby, the wobble data forming circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may form address data constituted by the frame number sync no and the track number (t:rack no) which respectively have 4 bits and 20 bits. </paragraph>

Such similar elements are designated with the same notation and a duplicated explanation will be omitted herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> In the mastering device <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, a wobble signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> forms the wobble signal WB from wobble data ADIP. The wobble signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> includes a generating circuit <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>A which forms and outputs predetermined reference signals. According to the mastering device <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, the spindle motor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is controlled by using one of the reference signals formed by the generating circuit <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>A by which the wobble signal WB in synchronism with rotation of the original disk <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed. The signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight> further includes a phase modulating circuit <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>B which forms the channel signal ch by modulating the phase of the wobble data ADIP by allocating a first reference clock &thgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in synchronism with- the reference signal and a second reference clock &thgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having a phase different from the phase of the first reference clock &thgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by 180&deg; in accordance with the logical level of the wobble data ADIP. As shown by FIGS. <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>C,<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>D and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>E, the phase modulating circuit <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>B allocates the first and the second reference clocks &thgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and &thgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such that an even number of channels are formed at the earlier half and later half of each bit (2 channels in this case) with a timing tc in correspondence with the center of each bit of the wobble data ADIP as a boundary and periods of Logic 1 and periods of Logic 0 are equalized at earlier halves and later halves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> That is, according to the phase modulating circuit <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>B, when the wobble data ADIP is at Logic 1 and after allocating 1 period of the first reference clock, 1 period of the second reference clock is allocated whereby the channel signal ch is formed such that channels of 0110 are successively formed (FIGS. <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>A-D). On the other hand, when the wobble data ADIP is at Logic 0 and after allocating 1 period of the second reference clock, 1 period of the first reference clock is allocated by which the channel signal ch is formed such that channels of 1001 are successively formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> The signal generating circuit further includes the signal generating circuit further includes a frequency modulating circuit <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>C wherein the frequency of the channel signal ch is modulated and the modulated signal is outputted as the wobble signal WB. In this processing, the frequency modulating circuit <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>C forms the wobble signal WB by modulating the frequency of the channel signal ch without interposing synchronization pattern and, as a result, reduces the redundancy by a corresponding amount. Further, if the central frequency cf frequency modulation is designated by a notation n, the frequency modulating circuit <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>C forms the wobble signal WB by allocating sine wave signals of the frequencies n&minus;d and n&plus;d to Logic 1 and Logic 0 of the channel signal ch. Such sine wave signals are allocated in units of a 0.5 wave such that zero crossings are carried out at timings is and to in correspondence with the bit center and the bit boundary of the wobble data ADIP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the signal generating circuit <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>, an even number of channels are formed at an earlier half and a later half of each bit with regard to the timing to in the center of each bit of the wobble data ADIP and the first and the second reference clocks &thgr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and &thgr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are allocated such that periods of Logic 1 and periods of Logic 0 are equalized at the earlier half and the later half whereby, according to the channel signal ch, the number of channels of Logic 1 are maintained to be the same as that of Logic 0 at the earlier half and the later half. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> When sine wave signals having frequencies of n&minus;d and n&plus;d are allocated to the channel signal ch in units of a 0.5 wave, in periods corresponding to the periods of the earlier half and later half of each bit of the wobble data ALIP, the wobble signal WB can be formed by canceling out phase displacements of the carrier signal having a frequency n. Accordingly, the wobble signal WB can be formed such that zero crossings exist at the timings is and to in correspondence with the bit center and the bit boundary of wobble data ADIP. Further, by allocating sine wave signals having frequencies of n&minus;d and n&plus;d in units of a 0.5 wave, the timing of the signal level of the wobble signal WB rising from 0 level and falling from 0 level, are maintained at the timings ts and to in correspondence with the bit center and the bit boundary of the wobble data ADIP and correct phase information of the carrier signal can be maintained. </paragraph>

The clock CK and the wobble clock WCK are formed with edge timing having correct phase information as a reference so that a clock with high accuracy and having no variation in frequency and phase can be formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49E and 49F</cross-reference>). Further, as shown by the arrow marks, with regard to the remaining edges, the phase difference &plus;&thgr; and &minus;&thgr; of the clock CK represent the logical levels of an earlier half and a later half of the channel signal ch and, therefore, the wobble data ADIP can be decoded with the phase differences &plus;&thgr; and &minus;&thgr; as references. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</cross-reference> is the block diagram of the wobble signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>. The wobble signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> amplifies the push pull signal PP by an amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> having predetermined gain and, thereafter, samples the wobble signal WB by way of a band-pass filter (not illustrated). A comparing circuit (COM) <highlight><bold>183</bold></highlight> binarizes the wobble signal WB with regard to a 0 level so as to form a binarized signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in which edge information is detected or obtained from the wobble signal WB (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52A through 52D</cross-reference>). In this way, either a rising edge or a falling edge of the binarized signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is provided with correct phase information and phase information of the remaining or other edge corresponds with information of the wobble data ADIP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> A phase comparing circuit (PC) <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> which may include constituted by an EXCLUSIVE OR circuit compares phases of the wobble clock WCK and the wobble signal WB and outputs a result SCOM of such phase comparison (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52D through 52G</cross-reference>). A low-pass filter (LPF) <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> limits the phase comparison result and outputs the low frequency component to a voltage control type oscillating circuit (VCO) <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> which forms and outputs the reading/writing clock R/W CK. The voltage control type oscillating circuit <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> forms the reading/writing clock R/W CK with a frequency that is 4 times larger than the frequency of the wobble signal WB. A dividing circuit <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> successively divides the reading/writing clock R/W CK and forms the clock CK and the wobble clock WCK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the phase comparing circuit <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, the dividing circuit <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>, the low-pass filter <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> and the voltage control type oscillating circuit <highlight><bold>187</bold></highlight> constitute a PLL circuit which forms the clocks R/W CK, CK and WCK by synchronizing the phases with timing corresponding to where the wobble signal WB rises after a zero crossing(s) (timing having correct phase information). Further, the wobble clock WCK is formed by shifting the phase of the binarized signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by &pgr;/2 with respect to the correct edge thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to this embodiment, with regard to the optical disk, due to the timing where the signal level of the wobble signal WB rises from 0 level or falls from 0 level and the maintaining of correct phase information of the carrier signal, in the case where the wobble clock WCK is in phase synchronism with the binarized signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the oscillating frequency is controlled such that a mean value of the phase comparison result SCOM provided via the low-pass filter <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> has a constant value. In this case, for example, when the phase of the wobble clock WCK is advanced (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52H</cross-reference>), the mean value of the phase comparison result SCOM is decreased by that amount (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52I</cross-reference>) and is controlled such that the oscillating frequency is decreased. Thereby, the PLL circuit forms various clocks with the rise of wobble signal WB having correct phase information as a reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, with regard to the binarized signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, in a time period T from when the logical level rises to when the logical level falls again, a difference between the time period where the logical level rises and the time period where the logical level falls is changed by timing of a falling edge during the time period T. The difference is provided with phase information of timing where the wobble signal WB falls after a zero crossing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> The wobble signal processing circuit <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight> reproduces the wobble data ADIP by effectively utilizing the above relationship. That is, a counter (CNT) <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight> clears a count value with a rise edge of the binarized signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as a reference, counts up the reading/writing clock R/W CK during a time period where the logical level of the binarized signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> rises and counts down the reading/writing clock R/W CK during the time period where the logical level of the binarized signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> falls (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53A through 53F</cross-reference>). Thereby, the counter <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight> detects an advance phase and a retard phase of the wobble signal WB in respect of the wobble clock WCK by the count value CNT with a half period of the wobble data ADIP as a unit. A flip flop (FF) <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> retards the count value CNT by the half period of the wobble data ADIP. A subtracting circuit <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> subtracts output data of the counter <highlight><bold>189</bold></highlight> from the output data of the flip flop <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. The subtracting circuit <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight> detects a change in timing where the wobble signal WB carries out zero crossing before and after the respective references of a bit boundary and bit center of the wobble data ADIP. When the timing change is advanced in respect of the wobble clock WCK, the subtraction result is a negative value L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is twice the count value CNT. When the timing change is retarded in respect of the wobble clock WCK, the subtraction result is a positive value H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that is twice the count value CNT. When the phase remains unchanged, the subtraction result is a value 0 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53G</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> With regard to the timing where the wobble signal WB carries out zero crossing before and after the respective references of the bit boundary and the bit center, an intermediary before and after the reference can be determined as a bit boundary from a phase modulation rule. When the value of subtraction before and after the bit boundary is positive and negative, respectively, the wobble data ADIP can be determined to beat Logic 1 and 0. Incidentally, the value of subtraction which interposes a portion remote from the bit boundary by 1 has no significance. According to this embodiment, bit reversion is set to occur always once in one address data block so that the bit boundary can be detected in a predetermined time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> The decoder <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> detects the bit boundary from output data &Dgr;&thgr; of the subtracting circuit <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>. Further, by determining the subtraction value &Dgr;&thgr; at every period with the detected bit boundary as a reference, the wobble data ADIP is decoded and outputted (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 53G and 53H</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> According to the constitution of this embodiment, even when the wobble signal is meandered or varied by phase modulation, an effect similar to that of the first embodiment can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> Further, in this case, the wobble signal can be formed such that the phase error becomes 0 when zero crossings occur at the timings ts and tc which correspond to the bit; centers and the bit boundaries of the wobble data ADIP and the wobble data ADIP is averaged in one bit of the wobble data ADIP whereby clocks with small variation in frequency and small variation in phase on an average and with high accuracy can be formed and the user data can be recorded with high density and the information recording face can be effectively utilized. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> That is, in this embodiment, if the multichannel mode is selected, the system control circuit sets the rotational speed of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> twice the normal rotational speed and enables access to the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> alternately by respective channels. In this case, the system control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> records the user data by allocating a track of the optical disk <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprising an idle region alternately to respective channels from the inner peripheral side to the outer peripheral side (FIGS. <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). An effect similar to that of the first embodiment can be provided even when the user data is recorded alternately by the track units in this way. Further, the recorded user data may be reproduced. </paragraph>
