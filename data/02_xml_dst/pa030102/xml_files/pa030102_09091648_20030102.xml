<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an ostomy appliance, a method for the use of the body member and a body side ostomy member. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In connection with surgery for a number of diseases in the gastrointestinal tract a consequence is, in many cases, that the colon, the ileum or the urethra has been exposed surgically and the patient is left with an abdominal stoma and the effluents or waste products of the body, which are conveyed through these organs, are discharged through the artificial orifice or opening and are collected in a collection bag, which is usually adhered to the skin by means of an adhesive wafer or plate having an inlet opening for accommodating the stoma. Also in connection with a fistula, the patient will have to rely on an appliance to collect the bodily material emerging from such opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Ostomy appliances are well known. Such appliances may be two-piece or one-piece appliances. In both types of appliances, a body side member is attached to the wearer&apos;s abdomen, and optionally a receiving member or bag is attached to the body side ostomy member for receiving exudates from the ostomy in case of a two-piece appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When using one-piece appliances, the whole appliance, including the adhesive wafer or pad securing the appliance to the skin is removed and replaced by a fresh appliance. When using two-piece appliances, the body side ostomy member is let in place for several days, and only the receiving member or bag is replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The service time of the body side ostomy member depends on the amount and aggressiveness of the exudates and of the tightness between the ostomy and the body side ostomy member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the known appliances it is necessary to change the body side member of two-piece appliance when the centre part of the adhesive wafer or pad has been sufficiently deteriorated to allow access of the aggressive exudates to the skin surrounding the stoma, irrespective of the fact that the wafer as such has a much longer wearing time. The access of aggressive exudates to the skin is causing skin problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Skin problems are common for persons having a stoma. Generally, about 40% have skin problems (Pearl et al. 1985 &ldquo;Early local complications from intestinal stomas&rdquo;, Arch. Surg. 120; 1145-1147.) and the frequency is especially high for persons having an urostomy or ileostomy. About 80% of the persons having an ileostomy have skin problems (Hellman, J. D., Lago, C. P. 1990 &ldquo;Dermatologic complications in colostomy and ileostomy patients&rdquo;, International Journal of Dermatology, 29 (2); 129-133.). The skin problems are mostly pronounced in a circular area about the stoma (&frac12; inch from the stoma) (Hellman and Lago 1990). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Frequent changing of the body side member of a two-piece appliance or the frequent exchange of a one-piece appliance is undesirable due to the irritation of the skin and the quality of life may be improved and the nuisance of the wearing of an ostomy appliance reduced if the intervals between exchanging of body side member can be increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is known to place a ring on the skin before applying the body side member or to make a filling between the edge of the stoma and the shaped whole of the ostomy appliance in order to form a seal between the stoma and the ostomy appliance in order to alleviate the problems using a commercially available medical grade adhesive paste. Such pastes are e.g. sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the trademark Stomahesive&reg; or by Coloplast under the trade mark Coloplast&reg; Paste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These pastas, however, do not have a composition which has a sufficiently cohesion ensuring safe removal thereof without leaving residues on the skin and, on the other hand, the pastes often are so sticky that they cannot easily be shaped using the finger without sticking to the finger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A paste should have a composition which is sufficiently tacky to secure the appliance or skin barrier to the abdomen, a cohesion ensuring safe removal thereof without leaving residues on the skin. On the other hand, the paste must not be so sticky that it cannot easily be shaped by a finger or hand without sticking to the finger or hand. Furthermore, the paste must show a sufficient elasticity in order to be able to follow the movements of the patient without slipping the skin and should also show a great resistance to erosion caused by aggressive exudates from an ostomy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> WO 92/18074 discloses a device in a stoma bandage comprising a sealing ring filled with a fluid to be applied around a stoma, said sealing ring being flexibly adjustable and having a variable diameter by the pressure of said liquid being increased or decreased for adjustment to the stoma of a user in order to seal between the stoma and the bandage. The sealing ring may be made of a material such as latex functioning aseptum through which an injection needle can be inserted in order to supply or remove fluid, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In GB Patent Application No. GB 2 290 974 is disclosed an ostomy appliance wherein a body-side is combined with a mouldable mass of non-hypoallergenic, non-memory putty-like adhesive, particularly based on hydrocolloid or hydrogel </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> GB Patent Application No. GB 2 290 974 discloses a body-side ostomy member comprising a ring to which a bag-side coupling ring or a bag can be attached, said ring comprising a rib and a flange, said flange being mounted on a wafer of medical grade adhesive having a central whole of diameter at least 65% of the internal diameter of the ring. A mouldable mass of non-hypoallergenic, non-memory putty-like adhesive, particularly based on hydrocolloid or hydrogel, is disposed radially inward of the wafer so that it forms a protective mass surrounding the stoma. The mouldable mass has a thickness of 1.25-3 times that of the wafer and a central hole therein of a diameter no more than {fraction (1/10)} th of the internal diameter of the ring. Both the medical grade adhesive and the mouldable adhesive are adhered to the skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> European Patent application No. EP 0 686 281 discloses an ostomy appliance comprising a collection pouch and faceplate assembly including a flexible patch having a stoma-receiving opening, a first layer of skinfriendly hydrocolloid-containing adhesive material along one side of said patch about said opening for securing said faceplate assembly to peristomal skin surfaces, and a second layer of relatively soft, easy-deformable and extrudable, adhesive sealant material of a composition that is resistant to being dissolved or disintegrated by stomal fluids and that immediately surrounds said opening; said second layer being displaceable inwardly and axially into said opening for forming a stoma-engaging annular gasket to prevent stomal fluids from contacting the peristomal skin and said first adhesive layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The sealing ring disclosed in WO 92/18074 does not provide a safe seal against stomal liquids if not being inflated to relatively high pressures which may cause irritation to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The mouldable mass of non-hypoallergenic, non-memory putty-like adhesive or flexible patch disclosed in GB Patent Application No. GB 2 290 974 and European Patent application No. EP 0 686 281 both are secured to the rim of the hole for receiving the stoma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The ostomy appliances disclosed in GB Patent Application No. GB 2 290 974 and European Patent application No. EP 0 686 281 both suffers from the drawback that the mouldable sealing material is only foreseen to be changed together with the body side member of the appliance. There is no teaching nor indication that the mouldable sealing material might be exchanged separately without removing the body-side member from the skin. Such separate exchange is not possible either for the embodiments shown in the drawings of these applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It has surprisingly been found that it is possible to provide an ostomy appliance having a separate sealing member disposed in the hole of the wafer or pad surrounding the stoma offering a convenient and comfortable solution to the above problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> None of the above mentioned patents describes the use of a separate sealing member which may be exchanged or substituted separately. Two different types of adhesives can be used for the sealing member&mdash;both being adaptable to the stoma without the use of tools. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> 1. Mouldable adhesives which can be adapted to the stoma by displacement, either inwardly or outwardly, of the adhesive mass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> 2. Flexible adhesives which can be adapted to the stoma due to the flexibility and compliance whereby it forms a protective layer on the peristomal skin surrounding the stoma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> 3. Medical grade adhesives known per se but being supplied as a disc having an outer diameter corresponding to the hole in a body side ostomy member and being supplied with a pre-formed hole or for custom-adaptation or fit using a tool and/or a template for use as a sealing member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> This idea according to the invention differs from the above mentioned patents since the central ring in this case can be substituted without substituting the outer adhesive, which carries the bag. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The invention relates in its broadest aspect to an ostomy appliance comprising a body side member, an optionally separately exchangeable receiving member or bag secured to the body side ostomy member and further a separate sealing member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In a second aspect, the invention relates to an ostomy sealing member in the form of a mouldable mass which shows a sufficient cohesion to be removed in one piece, independently of removal of the ostomy appliance, without leaving remaining adhesive on the skin or the ostomy appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In a third aspect, the invention relates to an ostomy sealing member in the form of a flexible medical grade adhesive which can be adapted to the stoma as a consequence of the flexibility and compliance of the adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In a fourth aspect, the invention relates to an ostomy sealing member in the form of a medical grade adhesive in the form of a disc having an outer diameter corresponding to the hole in a body side ostomy member and being supplied with a pre-formed hole or for custom-adaptation or fit using a tool and/or a template. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In a fifth aspect, the invention relates to the use of a mouldable mass of a hypoallergenic, substantially non-memory putty-like adhesive as a separate sealing member to be disposed in a hole of a wafer or pad of a body side member of an ostomy appliance for securing the ostomy appliance to the user&apos;s skin, said hole receiving a stoma, and said appliance optionally comprising a separately exchangeable receiving member or bag secured to the body side ostomy member for receiving secretions from the ostomy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In a sixth aspect, the the invention relates to the use of a medical grade adhesive in the form of a disc having an outer diameter corresponding to the hole in a body side ostomy member and being supplied with a pre-formed hole or for custom-adaptation or fit using a tool and/or a template as a separate sealing member to be disposed in a hole of a wafer or pad of a body side member of an ostomy appliance for securing the ostomy appliance to the user&apos;s skin, said hole receiving a stoma, and said appliance optionally comprising a separately exchangeable receiving member or bag secured to the body side ostomy member for receiving secretions from the ostomy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In a seventh aspect, the invention relates to the use of a flexible medical grade adhesive as a separate sealing member to be disposed in a hole of a wafer or pad of a body side member of an ostomy appliance for securing the ostomy appliance to the user&apos;s skin, said hole receiving a stoma, and said appliance optionally comprising a separately exchangeable receiving member or bag secured to the body side ostomy member for receiving secretions from the ostomy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In an eight aspect, the invention relates to a method of applying an ostomy appliance body side member comprising an adhesive wafer or pad for securing the appliance to the user&apos;s skin, said wafer or pad having a hole for receiving a stoma and a sealing member for sealing around the stoma disposed in said hole, said sealing member having a hole for receiving the stoma wherein the hole in the sealing member is enlarged by everting the inner rim of the hole towards or away from the stoma or by displacing the inner rim radially outwardly adapting the size of the hole of the sealing member to the size of the ostomy, aligning the stoma and the hole of the sealing member for accommodating the stoma and placing the sealing member and body side member on the abdomen of the ostomate with the stoma projecting into the hole and moulding the sealing member to seal around the stoma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The sealing member may be applied to the abdomen together with the body side member or separately. When applying separately, the sealing member may be placed first and the body side member afterwards or, if desired, vice versa, provided that the outer diameter of the sealing member is smaller than the diameter of the hole in the body side member. Thus, a greater degree of freedom in placing the body side member around the stoma is obtained.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The separate sealing member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may preferably be a uniform mouldable mass of a hypoallergenic, substantially non-memory putty-like adhesive or it may comprise further constituents such as a protecting film or a mouldable mesh. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The separate sealing member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be replaced together with the receiving member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> leaving the body side member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In the different embodiments of compositions of the sealing member shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, all adhesive surfaces may be protected by release liners to be removed before application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Reference is made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. A sealing member in the form of a mouldable adhesive ring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a centrally located opening. The mouldable adhesive ring is applied by placing the opening over the stoma and adjusting it to the stoma by displacing the adhesive mass inwardly by finger pressure whereby it forms a protective mass surrounding the stoma. The mouldable adhesive may also be adjusted to the stoma by displacing the adhesive radially outwardly to adapt the hole to the size and the shape of the stoma before application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The mouldable ring may be a composite made of 2 different materials laminated together: a mouldable adhesive layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a mouldable backing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The mouldable adhesive may be composed of a hypo-allergenic, soft, easy-deformable, non-memory putty like adhesive material and is preferably a hydrocolloid based adhesive or a hydrogel. The mouldable backing may e.g. be a Parafilm&reg; or made from a polymer solution which is sprayed on the surface and protects the surface of the adhesive against dissolution by secretions from the stoma and prevent a tacky surface on the side facing the bag. The mouldable backing streches out beyond the outer perifery of the ring in the form of a flange or adhesive layer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> This embodiment offers the following advantages: it is simple/easy to handle, it may be adapted to a stoma without use of tools, and it may easily be adapted to complicated shapes of the stoma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in the form of a sectional view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the mouldable ring is made in the form of a composite made of three different materials laminated together: A medical grade adhesive <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a mouldable adhesive mass <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and a mouldable backing <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The medical grade adhesive secures the sealing member to the peristomal skin. A variety of such barrier adhesives are known in the art and may be used here, one such formulation being disclosed, for example in patent DK 147035 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,551,490. The mouldable adhesive mass is laminated on top of the medical grade adhesive and is used for adapting the sealing member to the stoma by displacing the material. The mouldable adhesive may be composed of a hypoallergenic, soft, easy-deformable, non-memory putty like adhesive material and is preferably a hydrocolloid based adhesive or a hydrogel. The mouldable backing, e.g. Parafilm&reg; or a polymer solution which is sprayed on the surface, protects the surface of the mouldable mass against dissolution by secrete from the stoma and prevent a tacky surface on the side facing the bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The medical grade adhesive improves the performance due to elimination of the risk of dissolution of the mouldable adhesive mass. This also eliminates the risk of having residues from the mouldable material remaining on the skin after removal. The best performance is achieved if the medical grade adhesive is extended to cover the edges of the mouldable adhesive in order to protect the edges from erosion and dissolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> This embodiment offers the following advantages: it is simple/easy to handle, it may be adaptated to stoma without use of tools, it gives rise to no or very little residues on skin after removal, it gives rise to no or little erosion of adhesive, and it may easily be adaptated to complicated shapes of the stoma. </paragraph>

This composition is a water-insoluble, hydrophilic, pressure-sensitive adhesive including at least one irradiation cross-linked synthetic organic polymer (predominantly of derived from vinylpyrrolidone) and an adhesive plasticizer (polyethylene glycol). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The composition disclosed in EP 0 048 556 B1 suffers from the drawback that it comprises a considerable amount (25% to 45% by weight) of alcohol, ethanol and isopropanol being preferred. When using such a paste, there it is to be observed that only a limited time for forming the paste after the application as the paste cures when exposed to air. Furthermore, the amount of alcohol trapped in the paste paste must be minimised in order to avoid less attractive physical properties due to an adverse effect on the properties of the adhesive of an ostomy appliance which is placed upon the paste. Still further, the considerable amount of alcohol may irritate the skin and such a composition is not advisable to use on skin which has been sensibilised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The pastes disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,204,540 suffers from the drawback that the shapeability is very dependant of the content of mineral oil. If an insufficient amount of mineral oil is added the composition will be too tough to shape and if too much mineral oil is added the composition becomes sticky and difficult to handle. Generally, pastes consisting of polyisobutylene, butyl rubber and mineral oil may be very hard, if the content of butyl rubber is high and hence, the paste will be difficult to shape, or it will be very soft and liquid if the content of butyl rubber is low and the content of mineral oil is high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The mass used according to the invention is preferably in the form of a mouldable mass of a hypo-allergenic, substantially non-memory putty-like adhesive. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the sealing member is made from a mouldable mass of a hypoallergenic, substantially non-memory putty-like adhesive comprising </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> a) a blockcopolymer having a major content of di-block copolymer, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> b) a tackifying liquid constituent, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> c) a waxy constituent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The content of blockcopolymer is preferably from 1 to 20% by weight, the content of tackifying liquid is preferably from 5 to 60% by weight, and the content of waxy constituent is preferably from 1 to 10% by weight, calculated on the total composition of the mass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The mouldable mass further comprises one or more optional constituents such as petroleum jelly in an amount of up to 20% by weight, polybutylene oil in an amount of up to 30% by weight and/or liquid paraffin in an amount of up to 30% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The block copolymer preferably has a low molecular weight and a high content of di-block component. The molecular weight of the block copolymer is from 20,000 to 150,000, preferably from 30,000 to 100,000. The content of diblock copolymer in the blockcoplolymer is preferably above 10%, more preferred above 25% and more preferred above 30%. The content of diblock copolymer imparts cohesion to the mass and renders the mouldable mass less elastic than a corresponding mass comprising a threeblock copolymer due to a minor degree of physical cross-linking and imparts to the plasticity or substantially non-memory putty-like characteristics of the mass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The mouldable masses of the invention comprise a tackifying viscous liquid constituent. The action of the tackifying liquid constituent is to plasticize and tackify the copolymer. Such a plasticizer should be compatible with the copolymer as compatibility with the copolymer ensures that the adhesive may be removed as an integrated unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the mouldable masses of the invention comprise a waxy constituent. The role of the waxy constituent is to render the mass plastic and mouldable and impart non-memory characteristics to the mass. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The blockcopolymer may be a copolymer comprising a block of a relatively hard polymer which may form physical cross-linking and a block of a softer polymer. The constituents of the blockcopolymer may be the same as are conventionally used for blockcopolymers such as SBS, SIS or SEBS copolymers, e.g. styrene and butadiene, isoprene or ethylenebutylene copolymers. The preferred copolymer is a SEBS (styrene-ethylenebutylene-styrene copolymer) having a content of diblock component above 30%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The tackifying viscous liquid constituent is preferably a viscous polymeric material being compatible with the blockcopolymer. The tackifying liquid may be a polybutylene or polyisobutylene and is preferably a saturated component which cannot give rise to chemical cross-linking deteriorating the non-memory putty-like characteristics of the mass. The tackifying liquid component is more preferred a polybutylene and more preferably polyisobutylene. The molecular weight of a tackifying viscous polymeric component is preferably form 10,000 to 120,000 when determined by GPC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The mouldable mass may, if required, comprise a further oily plasticiser for plasticizing SEBS and polyisobutylene/polybutylene in order to reduce the elasticity. Such oily plasticizer is suitably a viscous polymeric material having molecular weight from 300 to 10.000 when determined by GPC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The mouldable mass may comprise a tackifier increasing the adhesive properties of the composition in order to ensure a good contact between the appliance and the skin. Such a tackifier is preferably a hydrocarbon tackifier homogeneously distributed in the mass. The tackifier is preferably a terpene tackifier resin or a dicyclopentadiene tackifier resin. Especially preferred according to the invention as hydrocarbon tackifier resin are polymers and copolymers of dicyclopentadiene, alpha-pinene and/or beta-pinene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The waxy component may e.g. be a mineral wax or petroleum jelly and is most preferred microcrystalline wax being compatible with the preferred blockcopolymer SEBS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention the mass comprises a hydrocolloid which are able to absorb moisture or liquids from the body and thus to increase the wearing-time of the adhesive and thus of the ostomy appliance. A hydrocolloid component may e.g. be a water absorbing and water swellable component being mixable with the main components of the mass. Any hydrocolloid known per se for ostomy or wound care purposes may be used. The hydrocolloid may e.g. be sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), hydroxyethylcellulose, pectin, gelatine, guar gum, karaya, locust bean gum, carrageenan, xanthan, or sodium or calcium alginate. A hydrocolloid will typically be present in an amount of from 20 to 70% by weight of the total composition in order to have a sufficient absorbent capacity and still retain the characteristics of the mouldable mass. More preferred, the total amount of hydrocolloids is from 30 to 60%, and preferably the total amount of hydrocolloids is from 45 to 60% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> For some purposes it is suitable also to include smaller amounts of a filler in the mass of the invention which may add to the cohesion and also contribute to the plasticity. Such filler may e.g. be any filler known per se for ostomy or wound care purposes such as talc, calcium carbonate, china clay, zinc oxide or the like. Such filler may constitute up to 3-20% by weight of the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Still further, the masses used according to the invention may optionally comprise further constituents such as emollients, disinfecting agents and/or bactericidal agents known per se for use for ostomy or wound care purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> An especially preferred embodiment of the invention is constituted by a mouldable mass comprising SEBS, polybutene, polybutene oil, a tackifier resin, microcrystaline wax, CMC, pectin, gelatine and zinc white. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The sealing member may according to the invention be in the form of a paste or in the form of a mouldable ring comprising a hypoallergenic, substantially non-memory putty-like adhesive. In one embodiment of the invention, the sealing member is in the form of a mouldable ring having a slot for facilitating adaptation to stomas having a small diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, the mouldable mass used is a pressure sensitive adhesive composition suitable for application to human or animal skin comprising a water dispersible polymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Such a pressure sensitive adhesive composition may, in a preferred embodiment, comprise a water dispersible polymer, one or more polymer(s) selected from the group consisting of polyolefins or copolymers or blends thereof, one or more physically cross-linked elastomers selected from block-copolymers comprising styrene and one or more olefins, polyethylene glycols and glycerol; optionally a butene polymer or copolymer, optionally a tackifying resin which may be partly or totally hydrogenated, optionally a microcrystalline wax, optionally a plasticizer, optionally one or more hydrocolloids and optionally a pigment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> By introducing a water dispersible polymer in a self-adhesive elastomeric matrix an improved adhesion in moist environment is achieved. This is ascribed to the fact that the water dispersible polymer is present at the surface of the adhesive agent and thus is able to cause an immediately absorption of water. The water-absorbing polymer furthermore remains sticky after having absorbed water which is in contrast to the non-absorbing elastomers used in conventional skin friendly adhesives and hence, a better adhesion over longer periods of time is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Such a pressure sensitive composition typically comprises 10-50% of a water dispersible polymer, 10-70% of one or more polymer(s) selected from the group consisting of polyolefins or copolymers or blends thereof, one or more physically cross-linked elastomers selected from block-copolymers comprising styrene and one or more olefins, polyethylene glycols and glycerol; 0-15% of a butene polymer or copolymer, 0-30% of a tackifying resin which may be partly or totally hydrogenated, 0-10% of a microcrystalline wax, 0-10% of a plasticizer, 0-50% of one or more hydrocolloids and 0-5% of a pigment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The water dispersible polymer is preferably a water-absorbing elastomer and more preferred a water-dispersible branched polyester. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The use of branched water-dispersible polyester in adhesive agents gives the following advantages: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The adhesive agent shows a superior adhesion in moist environments by having an immediately absorption of water giving a better wet tack as compared to conventional adhesive agents based on non-absorbing self-adhesive elastomers. The branched water-dispersible polyester is also contributing by giving a good adherence over a longer periods of time since the stickiness of the elastomer is retained even after absorption of body fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The adhesive agent is easily removed by washing due to the water-dispersibility of the polyester in tap water, but the adhesive agent is not affected by body fluids. The body fluids are ionic solutions in which the polyester component is not dispersible. Adhesive residues left on the skin can thus be removed very easily using tap water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Suitable water-dispersible branched polyester are polyesters having the following physical properties: a Brookfield Thermosel viscosity at 177&deg; C. of 1,000-500,000 mpa.s, more preferred 1,000-50,000 mPa.s, and preferably of 2,000-8,000, a ring &amp; ball softening point of 50-150&deg; C. more preferred of 80-90&deg; C., a penetration hardness as determined according to ASTM D 5 of 5-50 dmm, preferably about 30 dmm and a glass transition temperature T<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>according to ASTM D 3418 of from 5 to &minus;10&deg; C., preferably about &minus;5&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> A reduction or even omission of the amount of hydrocoloids is rendered possible as the branched water-dispersible polyester contributes to the absorption. A reduction of the amount of hydrocolloids improves the stability of the adhesive due to the reduction of the disintegration caused by the considerable swelling of the hydrocolloids in conventional skin friendly adhesives upon absorption of body fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> When hydrocolloids are present, suitable hydrocolloids are naturally occurring hydrocolloids such as guar, locust bean gum (LBG), pectin, alginates, gelatine, xanthan or karaya, semisynthetic hydrocolloids such as cellulose derivatives (e.g. salts of carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose), sodium starch glycolate and synthetic hydrocolloids such as polyvinylalcohol, polyethylene glycol or polyacrylates.. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Pigments may be used as fillers or for dying the adhesives of the invention. Suitable pigments are pigments conventionally used in adhesive compositions, e.g. titanium dioxide or zinc oxide. Zinc oxide offers the advantage of showing an antibacterial effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Preferred adhesives to be used according to the invention are e.g. adhesives comprising branched water-dispersible polyester and amorphous poly-alpha-olefines and having the composition:

<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The olefin component of the block-copolymers comprising styrene and one or more olefins is preferably a diene, especially a polybutadiene such as butadiene, isobutylene or isoprene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment the sealing member has a flange stretching from the outer rim thereof. Such a flange provides an extra security against leaks and excludes direct contact between the exudates and the coupling part of the ostomy device. Thus, a pollution or contamination of parts of the body side member during service or exchange of receiving member or bag is avoided. Avoidance of pollution or contamination of the body side member is of great importance when extending the weartime of the body side member as remains of the exudate on the body side member which may cause odour are avoided. The flange preferably has an adhesive on the side facing the body side member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment, the separate sealing member disposed in the hole of the wafer or pad surrounding the stoma shows overall plastic properties, wherein at least the area covering the separate sealing member is provided with a guide for adaptation of the hole of an ostomy appliance to the size of an ostomy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> It is especially preferred that the guide is visible from the side of a release liner facing the sealing member as this allows for a very simple adaptation of the hole before placing the sealing member around the stoma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The present invention enables the user to apply an ostomy appliance without the use of any tools. Thus, it is only necessary to use body side members having a sufficiently big hole, no adaptation by cutting using scissors is necessary, and the sealing member is adapted snugly to the stoma and the body side member using the finger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention relates to an ostomy sealing member in the form of a mouldable mass or ring which shows a sufficient adhesiveness to adhere to the skin and seal around an ostomy and between the ostomy and an ostomy appliance adapted to receive secretions from the ostomy and which shows a sufficient cohesion to be removed in one piece, independently of removal of the ostomy appliance, without leaving remaining adhesive on the skin or the ostomy appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In a further aspect, the invention relates to an ostomy sealing member in the form of a medical grade adhesive in the form of a disc having an outer diameter corresponding to the hole in a body side ostomy member and being supplied with a pre-formed hole or for custom-adaptation or fit using a tool and/or a template. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The sealing member of the invention may be used together with any ostomy appliance known per se for sealing between an ostomy and a body side member. This is also considered an aspect of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect, the invention relates to the use of a mouldable mass or ring of a hypo-allergenic, substantially non-memory putty-like adhesive as a separate sealing member to be disposed in a hole of a wafer or pad of a body side member of an ostomy appliance for securing the ostomy appliance to the user&apos;s skin, said hole receiving a stoma, and said appliance optionally comprising a separately exchangeable receiving member or bag secured to the body side ostomy member for receiving secretions from the ostomy. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Such a sealing member preferably comprises a hole for receiving the stoma. When applying the sealing member, the size of the hole may be enlarged to fit to the stoma or even larger whereafter sealing is provided by pressing the sealing member to fit snugly around the stoma. In one embodiment of the invention, the hole of a sealing member is provided with incissions from the rim of the hole, preferably radially, which renders it possible also to use sealing members having some elasticity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect, the invention relates to a method of applying an ostomy appliance body side member comprising an adhesive wafer or pad for securing the appliance to the user&apos;s skin, said wafer or pad having a hole for receiving a stoma and a sealing member for sealing around the stoma disposed in said hole, said sealing member having a hole for receiving the stoma, wherein the hole in the sealing member is enlarged by everting the inner rim of the hole towards or away from the stoma or by displacing the inner rim radially outwardly adapting the size of the hole of the sealing member to the size of the ostomy, aligning the stoma and the hole of the sealing member for accommodating the stoma and placing the sealing member and the body side member on the abdomen of the ostomate with the stoma projecting into the hole and moulding the sealing member to seal around the stoma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> This method allows for a simple adaptation of the ostomy appliance to the actual size of the stoma before placing the appliance around the stoma. </paragraph>
