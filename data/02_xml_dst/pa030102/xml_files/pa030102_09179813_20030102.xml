<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing cold-formed shaped forms of packaging from a metal plastic-laminate in which the laminate is held between a retaining tool and a die exhibiting at least one opening, and a stamp is driven into the die opening causing the laminate to be formed into a shaped form of packaging featuring one or more recesses. The present invention relates also to a device for performing the process of cold forming a metal-plastic laminate into a shaped form of packaging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is known to manufacture shaped forms of packaging such as e.g. base parts for blister packs, also known as push-through packs, or other forms of packaging e.g. by deep drawing, stretch-drawing or thermoforming. The shaped packaging may be manufactured from thermoplastics or from composites or laminates such as e.g. aluminium foils and plastic films or extruded layers of thermoplastics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> If the packaging is made of laminates containing metal foils, then shaping tools comprising a stamp, a die and a retaining tool may be employed for its manufacture. As it is being deformed, the laminate is clamped securely between the die and the retaining tool, and the stamp moved towards the laminate. As it is lowered, the stamp moves deeper into the openings in the die thereby deforming the laminate. In that process the flat laminate is converted into a shaped part exhibiting one or more recesses which are surrounded by shoulders corresponding to the original flat plane of the laminate. Only that part of the laminate in the region of the die opening can flow or be stretched to form a shaped part. Adequate lateral distance must be maintained between the stamp and the die opening in order that the laminate, especially laminates containing metal foil, can be deformed without cracks and pores forming. If the laminate contains a metal foil, only recesses of small sidewall height can be achieved by this cold forming process. The result is poor drawing ratios i.e. shallow recesses of large diameter and, therefore, forms of packaging which are too large in relation to the contents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One possibility for obtaining more laminate for shape-forming purposes may be to reduce the retaining force and to employ deep drawing methods. However, folds would form in the edge or shoulder regions, and so this type of technology may not be used e.g. for making blister packs from laminates containing metal foil. The edge region and, if desired, the shoulder region of shaped forms of packaging are normally employed for sealing on the lid. If there were folds present there, however, then it would not be possible to seal the edge and shoulders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The object of the present invention is to describe a process which enables shaped forms of packaging, or shaped parts, to be made from laminates containing metal foil by means of cold forming whereby the forms of shaped packaging so produced are free of folds, and the recesses exhibit large wall height. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> That objective is achieved by way of the invention in which a the die and the retaining tool feature a facing edge region and the die, within the edge region, features a shoulder region that surrounds the die opening or openings, and the surface of the shoulder region lies 0.1 to 10 mm lower than the surface of the edge region of the die, and a first stamp or stamps&mdash;featuring a high friction forming surface&mdash;pre-forms the metal-plastic laminate in one or more steps up to 100% of the final depth of the recess, and subsequently a second stamp or stamps&mdash;featuring a low friction forming surface&mdash;forms the pre-formed metal-plastic laminate in one or more steps to at least 100% of the final depth of the recess. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the present invention the various stamps are advantageously employed one after the other and, in a series of steps down maximum depth via pre-forming, each stamp is lowered into the die opening by the same amount or further than the preceding stamp. As the metal-plastic laminate springs back, at least the last forming step must exceed the full, desired depth of deformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a useful version of the invention the stamp is driven in a first step or steps down to 90%, especially usefully to 70% and advantageously to 50% of the final depth of the recess, and in a second step or steps is driven down to 100-115%, advantageously 103-110% of the final depth of the recess. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Usefully, the stamps or stamping tools, which exhibit a high friction forming surface and are employed in the first step or steps, are cylindrical, blunted cone, blunted pyramid or barrel shaped. The stamps employed for the second step or steps have the shape of a cone, pyramid, blunted cone, blunted pyramid, segment of a sphere or cap. The stamps for the first step feature in particular vertical or steep sidewalls, and the edge or periphery at the bottom of the stamp has a small radius. The lower friction surface stamp for the second step, may be vertical or less steep and in particular exhibit sloping sidewalls, and the transition to the bottom of the stamp may be rounded or roundish in shape. This enables the metal-plastic laminate to slide only poorly over the edge or periphery between the sidewall and bottom of the stamp so that the metal-plastic laminate material from other regions is deformed first, then in a second step or steps, because of the low friction and the rounded shape of the stamp, the metal-plastic laminate material from the bottom region of the stamp is also deformed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a second useful version the stamp with a high friction forming in contact with the laminate may exhibit higher friction than the stamp with a low friction forming surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The process according to the invention be performed e.g. using a die and retaining tool and two or more stamps which are lowered one after the other into the openings in a die then raised again. On their surfaces that effect forming the stamps or stamping tools exhibit different degrees of friction. For pre-forming a first stamp with high friction forming surface is employed; this tool is then withdrawn and a second stamp with low friction forming surface performs the final shape-forming in the same die. Likewise, one may employ three or more stamps with forming surfaces of two different degrees of friction or gradually smaller degrees of friction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The process may be advantageously performed in such a manner that the stamps are arranged coaxially or telescopically inside each other. A first stamp, featuring in particular a low friction forming surface and ring-shaped in plan view, can effect pre-forming by lowering it into the die. The first stamp may be left in the pre-forming position and a second cylindrical-shaped stamp which slides telescopically in the first ring-shaped stamp and exhibits a high friction forming surface, is then lowered effecting the final forming of the laminate. Such stamping tools may be made up of two or more ring-shaped stamping tools and an innermost cylindrical stamping tool all of which slide telescopically inside each other. The degree of friction of the surfaces effecting forming may decrease gradually from a high degree of friction on the outermost stamping tool to a low degree of friction on the innermost stamping tool, usefully at least in two steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The process may also be performed preferably in such a manner that several dies, in particular two dies with their retaining tools, are arranged one after the other and with a stamp appointed to each die. Correspondingly, with two dies and their appointed stamps arranged one after each other, the surface of the first stamp that effects forming may exhibit high friction, the second stamp low friction. Working at a set rhythm the laminate is pre-formed in a first step in the first die, then formed to the final shape in a second step in the second die. It is also possible to perform the pre-forming in two or more steps and to divide the final shaping operation into two or more steps, with the result that the total number of steps in the process used is three, four etc., etc., whereby the friction may be reduced in two steps or gradually in the course of the individual steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The recesses formed out of the area of laminate material may be cup-shaped, dish-shaped, cap-shaped, barrel-shaped, cylindrical etc. As viewed in plan view, the recesses may be round, oval or polygonal, such as two, three, four, or more cornered. Preferred are recesses with steep to vertical sidewalls which are as straight as possible and bases which are as domed as little as possible. The recesses are surrounded by a, normally flat, shoulder area of laminate material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The preferred form of die is such that the surface area of the die lies 0.1 to 2 mm, preferably 0.15 to 0.3 mm lower than the surface of the edge region of the die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The device according to the present invention may contain a die with one or more openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Usefully, the device, and therefore the die, exhibits 1 to 200 die openings, preferably 8 to 40 die openings. The deformation of the metal-plastic laminate is effected by a stamp, which may as such penetrate a die opening. If the die features several openings, then the stamp may exhibit a support or support plate or holder plate or the like with a corresponding number of stamping tools attached to it. The stamps or stamping tools are dimensioned in such a manner that that they can penetrate the die openings while shape-forming the metal-plastic laminate. Usefully, the diameter of the stamp or the stamping tool is 3 to 35% smaller than the diameter of the related die opening, preferably 1 to 15% smaller and in particular 5 to 10% smaller. By the diameter of the stamp or stamping tool or die opening in the case of a non-circular cross-section&mdash;such as a convex cross-section e.g. elliptic, oval, polygonal, rectangular, trapezium or rhomboid shaped etc.,&mdash;is meant the smallest diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As a rule, the walls of the openings in the die stand at an angle of 90&deg; to the surface of the shoulder region. The edges that the wall of the opening and the surface of the shoulder region form with each other may be rounded, with a radius e.g. of 0.1 to 10 mm, usefully 0.1 to 1 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In another preferred version the edge regions of the retaining tool and the die are each from 1 to 100 mm wide, usefully 2 to 30 mm and preferably from 3 to 20 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The die exhibits an edge region and within this edge region the shoulder region. The die openings are arranged in particular symmetrically or also asymmetrically within the shoulder region with the shoulder region forming struts that surround the die openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The shoulder region of the die exhibits distances of 1 to 50 mm, preferably 5 to 25 mm between the edge region of the die and the die openings and between the individual openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The edge region of the retaining tool or the edge region of the die, or the edge regions of the die and the retaining tool, may exhibit a roughness pattern over part or the whole of the surface there. Typical roughness patterns are corrugations, waffle patterns, embossed patterns, honeycomb patterns, knobs, tooth-like patterns, roughened surfaces etc. Instead of or in addition to the roughness pattern, peripheral strips e.g. of an elastic material such as rubber and the like may be employed. In the working position the edge regions of the retaining tool and the die usefully lie together over the metal-plastic laminate and, if desired with the support of the roughness pattern, hold the laminate in place such that it cannot be stretched. The shoulder region of the die usefully lies a distance from the parts of the retaining tool facing it; in this region the metal-plastic laminate does not make contact with the retaining tool, and the metal-plastic laminate can be stretched or flow according to the degree to which the stamp is lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The shoulder regions of the die may be covered wholly or partly with a layer that, at least on the surface, exhibits a low degree of friction. A low degree of friction here means friction values of 0.2 to 2.1 (dimensionless number), as measured according to method <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>A in British Standard 2782. The low friction layer may e.g. contain or be of plastics such as polytetrafluorethylene, polyoxymethylene (polyacetal POM), polyethylene or polyethylene-terephthalate. The low friction layer may also exhibit in mixture form two or more of the plastics mentioned by way of example or one or more of the plastics in mixture form along with hard substances in divided form such as glasses in spherical form. Instead of plastics, other materials may be considered for the low friction layer. This means, for example, metals such as aluminium or chromium steel, especially with polished surfaces. Other low friction layers such as ceramic layers or layers containing graphite, boron nitride or molybdenum disulphide may be employed. The thickness of the low friction layer on the shoulder of the die is not critical as only the surface is of consequence. Under industrial conditions the layer is subjected to large demands with regard to frictional forces and so preference should be given to a thickness that permits some degree of material loss. For that reason the thickness of layer of the above mentioned plastics may be e.g. from 0.5 to 20 mm. The layer of plastic may be inserted in the lowered region of the die as a preform, or it may be deposited by spraying, brushing, wiping or some other method of deposition. The plastics may also be deposited for example in a matrix of other materials such as ceramic or metal using chemical methods or physical methods such as electroplating or electrolytic deposition, plating or vapour deposition in vacuum, or the die may be made, at least in part, of the metals in question </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As a rule, high friction stamps and low friction stamps, both with surfaces effecting forming, comprise a retaining device such as a retainer plate and a number of stamping tools. The number of stamping tools usefully corresponds to the number of die openings. The stamping tools penetrate the openings in the retaining tool and the openings in the die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the case of stamp with high friction surfaces effecting forming, at least the surface effecting forming, i.e. the surface of the stamp or the stamping tools coming into contact with the laminate, exhibits a high degree of friction. By a high degree of friction in the present case is meant friction values&mdash;according to method <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> A, British Standard 2782&mdash;of e.g. 1.0 to 3.0 (dimensionless numbers). The high friction surface may contain or be e.g. of metals such as steel, or plastics such as polyacetal (POM), polyethylene, rubber, hard rubber or caoutchouc, including acrylic polymers. Using treatments such as roughening, a metal surface may be endowed with the properties producing high friction behaviour. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the case of stamps with low friction forming surfaces, at least the surface effecting forming, i.e. the surface of the stamp or the stamping tools coming into contact with the laminate, exhibits a low degree of friction. By a low degree of friction in the present case is meant friction values&mdash;according to method <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> A, British Standard 2782&mdash;of e.g. 0.3 or less to 2.1 (dimensionless numbers). The low friction surface may contain or be e.g. of metals such as steel, or plastics such as polytetrafluorethylene, polyoxymethylene (polyacetal, POM), polyethylene, polyethylene-terephthalate. The low friction layer may also exhibit in mixture form two or more of the plastics mentioned by way of example or one or more of the plastics in mixture form and, additionally in divided form, hard substances such as glasses in spherical form. Instead of plastics, other materials may be considered for the low friction layer. This means, for example, metals such as aluminium or chromium steel, especially such with polished surfaces. Other low friction layers such as ceramic layers or layers containing graphite, boron nitride or molybdenum disulphide may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In using the process according to the present invention the high friction stamp or stamping tools advantageously exhibit a higher friction value or higher friction values than the friction value or values of the low friction stamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Metal-plastic laminates that may be used are e.g. laminates containing a metal foil which is 8 to 15 &mgr;m thick, preferably 20 to 80 &mgr;m thick. The foil may be e.g. of steel, iron, copper and preferably aluminium. Included are also metal foils of alloys containing mainly one of the above mentioned metals. Preferred aluminium foils may e.g. be aluminium having a purity of at least 98.0%, usefully 98.3%, advantageously 98.5% and especially 98.6%, the remainder making up the 100% being the accompanying impurities. Further, aluminium foils e.g. of the type AlFeSi or of the AlFeSiMn type may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The plastics used may be e.g. layers, films or laminates, whereby the films and laminates may also be uniaxially or biaxially stretched, be of thermoplastics of the polyolefin, polyester, polyvinylchloride type and other types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Typical examples of thermoplastics of the polyolefin type are polyethylenes such as MDPE, HDPE, uniaxially, or biaxially stretched polypropylenes, polypropylenes such as cast polypropylene and uniaxially or biaxially stretched polypropylenes or polyethyleneterephthalate from the polyester series. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The thickness of the thermoplastic, whether as layer, film or laminate in the metal-plastic laminates may be e.g. 12 to 100 &mgr;m, preferably 20 to 60 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The metal foils and thermoplastics may be converted into a laminate e.g. by adhesive bonding, calandering or extrusion adhesive bonding. To join the layers, adhesives and bonding agents may be applied as required and the surfaces to be joined may be modified by a pre-treatment involving plasma, corona or flame treatment methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Examples of metal-plastic laminates are those having a first layer e.g. a film or a film-laminate of the above mentioned thermoplastics, a second layer in the form of a metal foil and, on the free side of the metal foil, a third layer viz., a sealing layer of a polyolefin such as polyethylene or polypropylene or PVC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Further useable metal-plastic laminates may exhibit a first layer e.g. a film or film-laminate of the above mentioned thermoplastics, a second layer in the form of a metal foil, and a third layer, for example a film or film-laminate or an extruded layer out of one of the above mentioned thermoplastics. Further layers such as sealing layers may be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The metal-plastic laminates may feature a sealing layer in the form of a sealable film or a sealable coating at least on one of the outer lying sides, or on both outer sides. The sealing layer is of necessity the outermost layer in the laminate. In particular the sealing layer may be on one outer side of the laminate, and should be directed towards the contents or shoulder side of the shaped packaging, this in order to enable the lidding foil or the like to be sealed into place. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Within the scope of the invention is the use of shaped packaging forms which have been cold formed by the process according to the invention, as a container for accommodating individual items in the recesses. Examples of such items are e.g. one, two or three tablets, drag&eacute;es, pills, ampoules etc. in each recess of a shaped form of packaging such as a blister pack or push-through pack.. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The device according to the invention may be employed for manufacturing cold formed shaped packaging forms such as blister packs for pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs and luxury consumables, technical articles, for base and lid parts of semi-rigid and rigid packaging, for enclosing purposes etc. out of metal-plastic laminates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> When thermoforming plastic films such as e.g. PVC into blister packs it is possible to achieve high sidewalls. Up to now it has not been possible to achieve such high sidewalls on the recesses of shaped forms of packaging such as blister packs made from laminates containing metal foils. This meant that the form of packaging that had to be used was much too large in comparison with the contents. It is now possible using the present process to produce shaped forms of packaging that do not exhibit the disadvantages experienced to date i.e. such as the low wall height compared to that achieved with thermoformed plastic films. With the present process it is now possible to manufacture shaped forms of packaging which with respect to size of packaging, are at least comparable, if not better compared e.g. with plastic blisters. The packaging can therefore be designed to look more attractive and to have a better image from the ecological standpoint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A drawing ratio&mdash;i.e. a ratio of diameter to the height of the recess formed&mdash;of e.g. 2 to 3 may be achieved. The diameter of the recess, if not round in cross-section, is to be understood as the smallest diameter i.e. in the case of non-circular cross-sections, such as a convex cross-section e.g. elliptical, oval, polygonal, rectangular, trapezium shaped, rhomboid etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The largest diameter of individual recesses may be e.g. 1 to 500 mm, preferably 3 to 30 mm, and the height of a recess from 1 to 100 mm, preferably 3 to 30 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The number of recesses in the base part is not critical and may e.g. be one, two or more. In pharmaceutical applications packs with 6 to 40 recesses are normal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> By cold forming is meant here forming at temperatures of e.g. 10 to 35&deg; C., preferably 20 to 30&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The laminates that are processed into shaped forms of packaging such as blister packs and in particular base parts of blister packs remain pore-free even at high drawing ratios, and the reject rate due to forming is substantially reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> explain the present invention in greater detail by way of example. </paragraph>

<detailed-description>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a state-of-the-art device comprising a die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> a retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a stamp <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In the present case the stamp features a support (not shown) and mounted thereon a number of stamping tools <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The number of stamping tools corresponds to the number of openings in the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The stamps or the stamping tools <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> penetrate the opening <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the retaining tool. A metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is placed between the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. By applying force, the retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is pressed against the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as a result of which the metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is held securely at all places of contact between the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, essentially unable to be stretched. The stamping tools <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are lowered under the application of force and enter the openings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the retaining tool, press against the metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&Prime; and&mdash;while deforming the metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime;&mdash;pass through the die openings <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the die, until the desired degree of deformation of the metal-plastic laminate has been achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The metal-plastic laminate is held both in the edge region and in the shoulder region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> between the retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, essentially unable to be stretched, and the deformation of the laminate effected solely within the metal-plastic laminate material covering the die opening <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> the process according to the invention is shown in two stages; the device&mdash;illustrated here in cross-section&mdash;shows the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the stamps (stamping tools) <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> features an edge region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; also the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> features an edge region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A roughness pattern <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is provided in the edge region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the die. The whole shoulder region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> i.e. the region of the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that is located within the die region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and forms the shoulders that surround the die openings, is lower than the edge region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> A layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided in the shoulder region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and is shown shaded in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. Layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a layer of a low friction material such as e.g. polytetrafluorethylene, polyoxymethylene, polyolefins or polyethyleneterephthalate etc. Advantageously, layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> extends over the whole shoulder region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which only covers part of the shoulder region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is possible in some cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Lowering the shoulder region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be achieved by a chip-forming process such as milling, grinding or spark erosion etc. The die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may also be in two parts such that the edge region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the shoulder region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be moved and adjusted with respect to each other and, on reaching the desired difference in height, may be secured in place with respect to each other. The die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may also be a casting that already exhibits the lower height in the shoulder region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Likewise, it is also conceivable for the retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> not to exhibit a flat surface facing the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, but an edge region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a shoulder region that is lower than the edge region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shape-formed in the device according to the invention. The metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be introduced into the device in the form of an endless strip from a supply roll or in sheet form. The different parts of the metal-plastic laminate that undergo different degrees of deformation are indicated by <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&Prime; and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime;. The metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is positioned, clamped between the retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and, especially in region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which is covered by the edge region of the retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, is unable to be stretched. The stamping tools are lowered under the application of force through the openings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the retaining tool, and press against the metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&Prime;. While deforming the metal-plastic laminate, the stamping tools <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are lowered through the openings <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the die until the desired degree of deformation of the metal-plastic laminate has been reached. The metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; in the whole of the shoulder region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> i.e. along the edge regions and the shoulders between the die openings <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, is able to flow and is deformed by stretching according to the extent to which the stamp <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is lowered into the die openings <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. In addition, the metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&Prime; between the shoulder region and the stamping tool <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is deformed by stretching. The stamping tools <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> have a surface exhibiting a high degree of friction and are to advantage cylindrical or barrel shaped. This means that the periphery or edges between the base and sidewall of the stamping tool are of small radius and the sidewall of the stamp form a steep angle or is vertical to the base of the stamp. The deformation is performed until e.g. 100% of the final depth of the recess has been reached. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The second stage in the process according to the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. There is no essential difference with respect to the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, openings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the roughness pattern <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the edge region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the edge region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the shoulder region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> as far as the device is concerned. In the second stage of the process other stamping tools <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are lowered into the die openings <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> thus deforming the metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further until the desired degree of deformation of the laminate has been achieved. The metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime;&Prime; can flow and be stretched further in the whole of the shoulder region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> i.e. along the edge regions and the shoulders between the die openings <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and to an extent according to the amount to which the stamping tools <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are lowered into the die openings <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Also the metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime; between the shoulder region and the stamping tool body <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is stretch-formed further. A stamping tool with e.g. a body <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of blunted cone cross-section is employed for the second stage of the process. The surface of the stamping tool body <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> effecting forming exhibits low friction. Consequently, the metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&Prime; in the region of the surface of the stamping tool effecting forming is also able to flow. The forming operation is performed e.g. at least until the final depth of the recess has been reached i.e. at least to 100% of the required depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> plan view of a die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, shows the edge region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the shoulder region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The edge region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may feature a roughness pattern <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The shoulder region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> lies 0.01 to 10 mm lower than the edge region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In an advantageous version the shoulder region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, is partly and especially fully covered with the described low friction deposit or layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The die openings <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are shown by way of example in a regular array in the shoulder region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As a rule these are holes i.e. openings or recesses that are round in cross-section or openings that are oval in cross-section. Also openings that are polygonal in cross-section e.g. rectangular, square or six sided may be created without any difficulty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> A retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is shown in plan view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which faces the die and comes to rest on the laminate during manufacture may be flat. In the production stage the laminate is securely clamped across the areas of contact with the edge region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the edge region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and viz., such that the laminate can not stretch or flow there. Instead of a flat surface the retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may also feature an edge region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and lower region within the edge region, or the retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may essentially comprise only of the edge region i.e. a ring. A roughness pattern may be provided over part or the whole of the surface in the edge region <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The edge region of the retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is usefully positioned and essentially of the same dimension as the edge region <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> exhibits a plurality of openings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> or recesses, in the present case openings. The openings <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are penetrated by the stamps or stamping tools and, accordingly, the holes are arranged in the same manner and at least approximately the same size as the openings <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The lines A-A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and B-B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> are the lines of cross-section through the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The process according to the present invention is shown simplified and schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. A metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is uncoiled from a roll <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and fed to a first stamp with body <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&prime; then to a second stamp with body <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&Prime;. Recesses are thereby pressed into the metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in two stages. The result is a shaped form of packaging to which the contents <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are then added. Thereafter, a lidding foil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be continuously uncoiled from a roll <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and sealed or the like onto the shaped packaging. The endless packaging strips can then be cut to the desired pack sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> is a further version of the process according to the invention taking place in two stages, the device, illustrated in cross-section, showing the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the retaining tool <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the stamp <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Further details and their notation being as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. A layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided in the shoulder region <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> the layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is shown shaded and is the layer of low friction material, known from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the first step in the process. The metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is being shape-formed by the stamps <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> which make up a unit and are in e.g. two parts. A hollow, cylindrical stamp <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which in plan view is ring-shaped and has a high friction forming surface, is lowered and pre-forms the metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the final shape-forming of the metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> takes place in the second stage. A cylindrical stamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> slides telescopically inside stamp <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> which in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> has reached its lower end position where it remains. The stamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> slides telescopically out of stamp <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and is lowered beyond stamp <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. As a result, the stamp <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with its low friction forming surface deforms the metal-plastic laminate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> advantageously up to and beyond the desired 100% depth of formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a single piece stamp <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> made up of materials <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> with different coefficients of friction. Accordingly, shape-forming surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the stamp <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> exhibits higher coefficient of friction than shape-forming surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and, in turn, shape-forming surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> exhibits a lower coefficient of friction than surface <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In the present example a relatively small die is shown. It is also possible to design dies according to the present invention with the shoulder region subdivided by transverse and/or longitudinal struts. The metal-plastic laminate is held, clamped securely in place, in the region of these struts. This enables a plurality of shaped packaging to be produced e.g. with one die and one stroke of the stamp. After the shaping process, the shaped packs that are produced simultaneously may be separated e.g. at dividing lines along the struts. </paragraph>
