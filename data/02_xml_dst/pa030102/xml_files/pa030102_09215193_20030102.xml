<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to testing method and apparatus of a glitch noise and a storage medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A differential non-linearity (hereinafter, abbreviated to DNL) is used as a representative value showing converting characteristics of an A/D converter. At present, there is a histogram method as a general DNL testing method. According to the histogram method, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B, a</cross-reference> signal having a ramp waveform <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</cross-reference> is inputted to an input terminal of an A/D converter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and an A/D conversion is performed at a clock frequency which is fairly higher than that of the input ramp waveform. Each code of converted digital output data <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference>. The number of times of generation of each code converted by a clock corresponds to the DNL between the conversion bits. Therefore, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D, a</cross-reference> histogram in which an axis of abscissa shows a digital output code and an axis of ordinate indicates the number of conversions is obtained. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D, a</cross-reference> mean value <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the numbers of conversions of all of the digital output codes corresponds to 1 LSB of the A/D converter <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The value having the largest difference among the numbers of conversions of the codes for the mean value <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is set to the DNL of the A/D converter. The histogram method has an advantage such that even if random noises are mixed into an input signal or the like upon testing, by getting the mean value of the histograms due to the repetition of a few times, the noises can be reduced and a DNL test can be performed at relatively high precision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, such a histogram method has the following problem. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, in an A/D converter for generating a glitch noise <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in output data, its histogram becomes as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B and a</cross-reference> glitch noise of the n-th bit is hidden into a digital output code of the (n&plus;2)-th bit. Therefore, it is difficult to find a defect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There is also a drawback such that in the case where the standard of the DNL of the A/D converter is equal to or less than &minus;1 LSB, a defect in which monotonousness (data changes one bit by one in a manner such that the (n&plus;1)-th bit appears after the n-th bit) is missing occurs, for example, in the case where the (n&plus;2)-th bit comes after the n-th bit, the histogram data of the (n&plus;1)-th bit is equal to 0, the DNL of the (n&plus;1)-th bit is equal to (0&minus;1 LSB)&equals;&minus;1 LSB, and the monotonousness of the A/D converter cannot be guaranteed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, an object of the invention to solve the foregoing problems and to provide testing method and apparatus of providing testing method and apparatus for easily testing a glitch noise and a storage medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To accomplish the above object, according to the invention, a signal of a ramp waveform is inputted to an A/D converter, a difference between a digital output code outputted from the A/D converter and another digital output code obtained by shifting the output code by predetermined clocks is obtained, and a glitch is detected on the basis of a peak value of such a difference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the predetermined clocks are one clock. </paragraph>

When those amplitudes coincide, it is determined that the glitch noise has occurred in a flat portion of the relevant bit of the output code. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the glitch noise which cannot be detected by only the histogram method can be detected at high precision. Further, an amplitude of the glitch noise, a generating position, and a generating position (whether it is a change position of bits or a flat portion) on the relevant bit can be known. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described hereinbelow with reference to the drawings. Since a method of recognizing converting characteristics of an A/D converter is similar to the method described in the related art, its description is omitted here. A testing method of a glitch noise will now be mainly explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C are explanatory diagrams of an embodiment of the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> shows digital output data <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> including a glitch noise <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> after completion of the A/D conversion. The output data is shifted by one clock (to the right) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. Data is obtained by subtracting output data <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> from the output data <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. Resultant data <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> obtained by this subtraction is shown in Fig. of a portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> corresponding to the glitch noise largely appears as compared with the other portions. The amplitude of the portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shows an amplitude of the glitch noise. By detecting (measuring) to which number of clocks from the start of the A/D conversion the amplitude corresponds, the position at which number of bits of the output code a defect occurs can be tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> If the glitch noise occurs at a change position from the n-th bit to the (n&plus;1)-th bit, the amplitude of the portion corresponding to the glitch noise on the plus (&plus;) side does not coincide with that on the minus (&minus;) side (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, if a glitch noise <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> occurs at a flat portion of the relevant bit of digital output data <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> after completion of the A/D conversion, the output data <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shifted by one clock (to the right) as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B and data <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> obtained by subtracting output data <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> from the output data <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> becomes as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>. It will be understood from the data <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that the value on the (&plus;) side of the amplitude of the portion corresponding to the glitch noise and that on the (&minus;) side coincide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, by obtaining a difference between the digital output data after the A/D conversion and the data obtained by shifting the digital output data by one clock, the glitch noise can be detected, the amplitude can be known, and its feature (for example, generating position or the like on the relevant bit) can be known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the first embodiment. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> denotes an A/D converter to be tested; <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> a ramp generator; and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> a timing generator. In response to an input of a trigger signal from the timing generator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the ramp generator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> inputs a signal having a ramp waveform to the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In response to a clock signal from the timing generator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> executes an A/D conversion of the inputted signal of the ramp waveform and stores digital output data into memories A and B. Subsequently, in response to a clock signal from the timing generator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the storage data is read out from each of the memories A and B while delaying a phase of the data in the memory B by a time corresponding to one clock from the data in the memory A. In a calculator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the read-out data of the memory B is subtracted from the read-out data of the memory A and a peak value of a subtraction value is detected by a peak detector <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. If the peak value lies within a range of &plusmn;1, a discriminator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> determines that no glitch noise occurs. When the peak value exceeds the range of &plusmn;1, since this means that the glitch noise has occurred, the discriminator <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> decides that there is a defect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the second embodiment. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, reference numeral <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> denotes a CPU for executing a control procedure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> in accordance with a program stored in an ROM <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> denotes an RAM having a work area of the CPU <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>; <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> a display for displaying a result or the like of a test, which will be explained hereinlater; <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> a printer for printing the result or the like of the test, which will be explained hereinlater; <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> a keyboard for inputting an instruction or the like to the CPU <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>; and <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> an interface for inputting output data from the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A testing method of the second embodiment will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. First, in response to the input of a trigger signal from the timing generator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the signal having the ramp waveform is inputted to the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (step F-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). In response to a clock signal from the timing generator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the A/D converter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> executes an A/D conversion of the inputted signal of the ramp waveform and fetches an obtained digital output data through the interface <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (F-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). The output data is stored (copied) into an arbitrary array <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the RAM <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the output data is similarly copied into an arbitrary array <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a form in which a phase is shifted by one clock (F-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). Subsequently, data obtained by subtracting the array <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the array <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is stored into an arbitrary array <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (F-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). A peak value of the array <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is detected (F-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). A check is made to see if the peak value lies within a range of &plusmn;1 (F-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). If the peak value lies within the range of &plusmn;1, since this means that no glitch noise is generated, the data of the array <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is extracted and a next test of the histogram method or the like is executed (F-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). When the peak value exceeds the range of &plusmn;1, since this means that the glitch noise has occurred, it is decided that a defect has occurred, and the testing operation is stopped (F-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment, although the program has been stored in the ROM, a program stored in a floppy disk, a CD-ROM, or the like can be also installed to an RAM or a hard disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the foregoing embodiments but many modifications and variations are possible within the spirit and scope of the appended claims of the invention. </paragraph>
