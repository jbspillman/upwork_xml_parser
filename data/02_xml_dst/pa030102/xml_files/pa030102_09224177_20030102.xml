<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Air travel is becoming increasingly prevalent in both business and leisure travel. As a result, airports are experiencing increasing amounts of air traffic. Accordingly, air traffic control needs to become more efficient to safely bring in more aircraft with limited resources, i.e., runways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Currently, airports that have aircraft landing on runways that are less than 4,300 feet apart suffer a serious reduction in capacity when Instrument Approach Procedures (IAPs) are implemented due to weather conditions. The weather conditions under which IAPs commence are not as severe as Instrument Meteorological Conditions, defined by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to be ceilings less than 1,000 feet or visibility less than 3 miles. For example, a midwestern airport adopts IAP when the ceiling is less than 3,200 feet or when visibility is less than 8 miles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For a number of years, the quest for capacity improvements to make Airport Arrival Rates (AAR) robust to weather changes has been pursued with vigor. Recently, a system called the Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) has been developed by the FAA, which gives the controllers high-update surveillance capability and an alerting function to determine if aircraft are blundering and need to perform a &ldquo;breakout&rdquo; maneuver to avoid a potential collision. PRM applies to runways with spacings, centerline to centerline, of at least 3,400 feet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> But airports are not always afforded the luxury of runway spacings of at least 3,400 feet. Busier airports tend to be associated with large metropolitan areas where real estate is at a premium. Runway spacing may be as low as 2,500 feet or even lower in many airports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As will be seen from the above concerns, there exists a need for an airborne alerting system to provide capacity improvements, especially for the case of runway spacing below 3,400 feet. The above mentioned problems with AAR and other problems are addressed by the present invention and will be understood by reading and studying the following specification. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a method of assuring separation of aircraft during approach. In one embodiment, tracking information for aircraft is obtained through data transmissions by the aircraft. An observer is alerted if the tracking information indicates at least one of the aircraft is blundering from an assigned approach. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention provides a method of assuring separation of aircraft between a first aircraft and other aircraft. The method includes determining whether the other aircraft are transmitting tracking information. Aircraft transmitting the tracking information are armed aircraft. The tracking information comprises position and velocity, wherein the position is defined in a geographic coordinate system. The method further includes obtaining the tracking information from each armed aircraft, applying separation assurance algorithms to the tracking information for each armed aircraft within a predetermined zone relative to the first aircraft, and alerting an observer when the separation assurance algorithms are indicative of a threat to the first aircraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment of the invention includes an alerting system. The alerting system includes a track file. The track file contains data including latitude data, longitude data and altitude data for each aircraft providing ADS-B position reports to support the alerting function associated with closely-spaced parallel approaches. The data are defined in a geographic coordinate system. The alerting system generates alerts to an observer when a comparison of the positions and trajectories are indicative of a threat to the observer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The various embodiments of the invention may be implemented on computer systems and provide an improvement over the Precision Runway Monitor system because the embodiments of the invention are applicable to runways spaced as closely as 2,500 feet. While the concepts of the invention are applicable to runways spaced closer than 2,500 feet, current FAA rules associated with Wake Vortex protection require that two runways be treated as a single runway if they are closer than 2,500 feet. The airborne alerting system further provides pilots proximity awareness of the adjacent traffic. The airborne alerting system allows for minimal ground infrastructure, reducing installation and operational costs. It further reduces air traffic controller personnel requirements, since PRM requires two dedicated controllers and the system embodied in the invention does not. By leveraging existing TCAS II protocols, pilot training is minimized. And the airborne alerting system embodied by the invention also facilitates quicker alerting of pilots to potential problems, given that alerting comes directly from an on-board system and not via an air traffic controller over the radio. Subsequently, safety is increased and/or false alarms are reduced.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that structural, logical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims. Like numbers in the figures refer to like components, which should be apparent from the context of use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the following description, the terms own ship (or aircraft), other ship (or aircraft) and adjacent ship (or aircraft) will be used. Own ship refers to the aircraft from which a frame of reference is established, e.g., a pilot&apos;s own aircraft. Other ship refers to any aircraft other than own ship. Adjacent ship refers to another aircraft in a parallel approach with own ship. An adjacent ship, by definition, is also an other ship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The invention includes an airborne alerting system to provide separation assurance during closely-spaced parallel approaches. Closely-space parallel approaches are defined as approaches to parallel runways separated by less than 4,300 between runway centerlines. The concepts embodied by the invention are referred to herein by the modified acronym CASPER for Closely-Spaced Parallel Runways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts own ship <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> approaching first runway <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and adjacent ship <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> approaching second runway <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. First runway <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and second runway <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are a pair of parallel runways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Each aircraft, or ship <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, uses Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) navigation to fly a precision approach. The precision approach is uplinked to each aircraft from a Satellite Landing System (SLS) ground station <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The SLS ground station <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> also provides the differential corrections to the on-board GPS (not shown) to enable DGPS navigation. Each aircraft broadcasts its position, velocity, and intended glidepath using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B). The CASPER system uses the received ADS-B information from the other aircraft in combination with its own aircraft state-data to determine if either aircraft is flying a threatening trajectory (i.e., blundering off its approach course) with respect to the other. An aircraft flying such a threatening trajectory will be referred to herein as a threat to the other aircraft. In one embodiment, the invention includes criteria for determining which aircraft are landing on a parallel runway and could be threats, auditory and visual status annunciations, a methodology for interacting with the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and communication of alerting system status to the ground to keep Air Traffic Control informed. In another embodiment, the invention further includes precise navigation along the approach path, enabled by the Differential Global Positioning System ground station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The embodiment further includes a sharing of position, direction of flight, alerting system status and TCAS system status, and approach information via the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) link between the aircraft. The embodiment still further includes an alerting function that checks the velocity and direction of flight for the various aircraft, checks the trajectory to determine if it is hazardous to surrounding aircraft, and provides visual and auditory alerts to an observer, e.g., a pilot, if a hazardous situation is developing. In addition, the embodiment includes a concept of operations which provides linkage between the constituent parts and a sequence to the events, including system modes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating the various functions of an embodiment of the invention, identified in the previous paragraph, and indicates what hardware may be used to host the functions as well as the nature of the links and information flow between the various hardware elements.

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Precise Navigation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The AILS (Airborne Information for Lateral Spacing) separation assurance algorithms use navigation data two ways. Aircraft position is used to evaluate how well the pilot is following the glidepath. Aircraft position and velocity are used to predict future position to determine whether aircraft on parallel approaches threaten one another. AILS is the NASA program for developing alerting algorithms for closely spaced parallel approaches. AILS also refers to the alerting logic used once the aircraft are established on a parallel approach. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The GNSSU contains a GPS receiver that provides navigation data. When the aircraft is within range of the SLS ground station, the GPS data is differentially corrected. The GNSSU outputs a variety of navigation-related parameters on an ARINC <highlight><bold>429</bold></highlight> bus. Most data is available at 1 Hz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Aircraft position is described using GPS latitude, longitude, and altitude. GPS latitude and longitude use two labels each, i.e., octal labels 110/120 and 111/121 respectively. Aircraft velocity is described as North/South velocity, East/West velocity, and vertical velocity using octal labels 166, 174, 165 respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> To evaluate the validity and accuracy of the navigation data, the airborne alerting system algorithms make use of the horizontal and vertical figures of merit (HFOM and VFOM). HFOM and VFOM use octal labels 136 and 247 respectively. These provide an estimate of the accuracy of the position data output by the GNSSU. The FOM is the 95% confidence level (2&sgr;) for the accuracy of the position solution. For example, if the HFOM were 0.7 nm (nautical miles), we would expect that 95% of the time the aircraft horizontal position that is output by the GNSSU is within 0.7 nm of the true position. When the GNSSU is in differential mode, VFOM is typically 2-3 m, while HEFOM is typically 1-2 m. When the GNSSU is in navigation mode, VFOM is typically 80-100 m, while HFOM is typically 50-80 m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> To assure that the navigation data between the own ship and other ship can be synchronized, the alerting system utilizes UTC (Universal Coordinated Time) time from the GNSSU. UTC time is divided into two ARINC labels and is available in a variety of ways. Use of octal labels 150 and 140 allows obtaining UTC time to 1 msecond resolution. Although UTC time is currently available to 0.9 nanosecond resolution, such precision is expected to provide only marginal improvement in accuracy or safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> To synchronize system time and UTC time, the time mark on the GNSSU is used. The time mark is a 1 Hz signal with its rising edge corresponding to the time when the navigation outputs on the ARINC <highlight><bold>429</bold></highlight> bus are valid. This synchronization is performed by a time manager function, described later, and is part of the functionality of CASPER module <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> hosted in the TCAS hardware, i.e., TCAS box <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The differential corrections to the GPS signal come from the VHF Data Link Unit (VDLU) (not shown). The VDLU can experience dropouts, depending on the approach an aircraft is on and the distance from the VHF transmitting antenna. It is uncommon to experience an outage in the VDLU link once the aircraft is on course at the final approach fix at 4.5 nm. Outside of 6.5 nm from the runway threshold, the coast time for the SLS is 30 seconds. Inside of 6.5 nm, the coast time is 6 seconds. Once the coast time is exceeded, the GNSSU currently drops out of differential mode. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The fact that the aircraft is equipped with a Mode S capable of both generic and event-driven ADS-B messages will be reflected by a unique identifier in the Mode S identifier block on the ATC&apos;s plan view display. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a plan view of own ship <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, with identifier block <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>, approaching closely-spaced parallel runways <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and depicting radio communications associated with approaching own ship <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> in a conversation bubble <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>. The unique identifier provides ATC personnel with advance notification that the aircraft is capable of accepting a CASPER approach, therefore eliminating the need for the extra spacing usually required for dependent parallel approaches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> CASPER Eligible </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The following description presumes a nominal approach. First, the pilot receives clearance from Air Traffic Control (ATC) to perform a CASPER approach. Next, the pilot dials in the specified CASPER approach using the Control Display Unit of the Flight Management System or a control-head dedicated to the Satellite Landing System. Once the aircraft is within range of the ground station, the approaches for the local airport are received by the aircraft VDLU. The VDLU demodulates the radio signal and passes the approach information to the GNSSU, which selects approach data corresponding to the approach selected by the pilot. Once the CASPER approach is confirmed, the aircraft is eligible to perform a CASPER approach. This is indicated to the ground and other aircraft by the mode flag Eligible. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a plan view of approaching CASPER-equipped aircraft, own ship <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, depicting radio communications associated with own ship <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> regarding clearance for a CASPER approach in a conversation bubble <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Once the CASPER approach is confirmed (mode transition to Eligible), transmission and receipt of CASPER-specific ADS-B messages begins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> CASPER Armed </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Once Eligible, integrity checking of messages from all the other CASPER-Eligible aircraft is initiated. The integrity check is performed by comparing the TCAS range and the ADS-B range to determine if the two position estimates are adequately correlated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In addition, the navigation FOM is checked for own ship and other aircraft. Aircraft should not perform a CASPER approach if potential CASPER targets might have degraded or failed navigation data or ADS-B messages. The CASPER system is considered to be Armed (ready to do an approach with trajectory alerting) if the ADS-B messages pass the integrity check and all aircraft FOM are within range. For convenience, all aircraft that are either unequipped to perform CASPER approaches, in Equipped mode or in Eligible mode, but not in Armed mode or Active mode, will be referred to as unarmed aircraft. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a plan view of approaching CASPER-eligible aircraft, own ship <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and other ship <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, indicating the ADS-B messages <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> transmitted by both aircraft. Each CASPER-eligible aircraft is a CASPER target to the other aircraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> CASPER Active </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Once the aircraft are near the extended runway centerline, the two position estimates (from TCAS and ADS-B) are determined to be adequately correlated and the ADS-B messages are determined to be of sufficient integrity, the CASPER system will inhibit Resolution Advisories for CASPER targets and provide blunder protection for those aircraft. At this point, the pilots, with the support of the CASPER system, are responsible for lateral separation assurance. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a plan view of approaching CASPER-active aircraft, own ship <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and adjacent ship <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, making CASPER approaches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The CASPER system, from the pilot&apos;s viewpoint, is similar to TCAS in that a collision alert requires immediate action in executing the evasive maneuver. Unlike TCAS, however, the evasive maneuver is envisioned to be procedural in nature, consisting of a climbing turn away from the parallel runway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Blundering Aircraft </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> If a CASPER target blunders and ignores the navigation alerts generated by the AILS algorithm, the CASPER system will sound an alert. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a plan view of approaching aircraft, own ship <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and adjacent ship <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, showing adjacent ship <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to be blundering from its assigned approach. Adjacent ship <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is thus a threat to own ship <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> If the deviating aircraft adjacent ship <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> continues to blunder, an alert is annunciated and the aircraft should perform an Emergency Escape Maneuver (EEM), turning away from the parallel traffic and initiating a climb to the Missed Approach Procedure (MAP) altitude. AILS will alert for an EEM for all aircraft that have the blunderer as a CASPER target once the blunderer crosses the centerline between the runways. Once the aircraft are on a missed approach, the blunderer will be treated as a TCAS threat. The blunderer will transfer from Active to Armed once it crosses the parallel runway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; Missed Approaches </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Once an aircraft is on a missed approach, for whatever reason (e.g., pilot cannot see runway environment at Decision Height, equipment failure or other reason), the CASPER system changes modes from Active to Eligible and all surrounding aircraft are transferred from CASPER targets to TCAS targets. If an aircraft finds that one of its CASPER targets is no longer Active, it should transfer that aircraft from a CASPER target to a TCAS target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The aircraft will execute the published MAP and receive vectors from ATC to sequence it back into the landing pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Missed Approach vs. Emergency Escape Maneuver </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The MAP should remain unchanged from its fundamental structure and function as currently used and recognized in the art. The MAP will be a much more common event than the Emergency Escape Maneuver (EEM) resulting from an alert as part of a system to support Closely-Spaced Parallel Approaches (CSPA). Pilots elect to execute a MAP for a variety of operational reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: the airport environment cannot be visually acquired at Decision Height, an equipment malfunction during the approach (e.g., a generator drops off-line), or the runway environment is not clear (runway transgression). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The EEM is only in response to an ALERT that an aircraft on the parallel runway is threatening own ship. The quickest way to resolve the hazardous proximity is to turn away from the other aircraft and climb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The turn-climb maneuver, if executed with the frequency of MAPs, would become an operational nuisance because of the effect on the surrounding airspace. The EEM is &lsquo;proceduralized&rsquo; so that the flight crew can execute the maneuver the moment an alert is sounded. It is anticipated that the controller would issue vectors to the aircraft that have departed the Final Approach path to sequence those aircraft back into the traffic pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The EEM LOST COMM situation can be accommodated by using the following approach. Upon reaching the MAP altitude (this altitude will be site specific, as is the HOLD altitude for each MAP), the aircraft is turned toward the applicable MAP HOLD fix. The aircraft then enters the HOLD using the appropriate entry procedure. The remainder of the EEM LOST COMM procedure would be identical to the MAP LOST COMM procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> ADS-B, Navigation, or other System Failures </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> If the overall system integrity is violated at any point during the approach because of equipment failure, either airborne or ground-based, the system will annunciate a system failure, an EEM breakout procedure will be executed to initiate the Missed Approach, and TCAS will resume active collision avoidance responsibility. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Because of these discrepancies between the desired and nominal data exchange, the ADS-B information required by CASPER will be broadcast as what is known as an on-condition report or message. The ADS-B broadcast rate should be matched to processing rate of the CASPER algorithms. The recommended rate for processing of the CASPER algorithms is 1 Hz, so the ADS-B broadcast rate should be sufficient to provide the ADS-B report at 1 Hz. It is noted that the invention is operational at data rates other than 1 Hz, but that 1 Hz is identified as a desired rate for system response time and related safety considerations </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> If the standard ADS-B broadcast becomes time tagged and sufficiently accurate and timely, the aircraft position and velocity could be broadcast and received in a standard ADS-B message, while the CASPER mode flags and glidepath description, or approach data, could be broadcast and received in an on-demand message. Other methods and apparatus may be used to provide the position, velocity, mode flags and glidepath description to the CASPER algorithms. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> To facilitate efficient implementation of the invention, the controllers on the ground need some of the same information that the other aircraft do about the state of the CASPER system. Controllers can get this information via ADS-B, as the other aircraft do. However, it is noted that most airports are not equipped to receive ADS-B messages at the present. As an alternative, the mode of the CASPER system may be communicated using the Mode S identifier block. The ground will then know: 1) if an aircraft is equipped to do CASPER approaches, i.e., Equipped; and 2) if the aircraft has successfully dialed in the CASPER approach and is broadcasting and receiving ADS-B messages from other aircraft, i.e., Armed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Starting and Stopping the CASPER-Specific ADS-B Broadcast </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The CASPER-specific ADS-B broadcast need not be continuous. Such broadcasts are only required when aircraft are near the destination airport. Accordingly, it is desirable to implement ADS-B message control for the CASPER-specific broadcast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The broadcast and reception of the CASPER-specific ADS-B report starts once the aircraft has a confirmed approach from the SLS. The system should also check that the aircraft is in the vicinity of the destination airport, which, for purposes of this description, is defined as being within 50 m of the runway threshold. This value is arbitrary and is with the discretion of the designer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The CASPER-specific ADS-B broadcast stops once the aircraft lands or is no longer in the vicinity of the destination airport for which the SLS approach was confirmed. For purposes of this description, an aircraft that has landed is an aircraft with a speed of less than 50 knots. This value is arbitrary and is within the discretion of the designer. By the definition in the preceding paragraph, an aircraft is no longer within the vicinity of the destination airport if it is more than 50 nm from the runway threshold for the confirmed CASPER approach. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Continuous determination of whether aircraft are in the vicinity of the airport are desirable to prevent inappropriate mode flags. As an example, once the pilot tunes in an approach, and the CASPER approach confirmed flag is set to TRUE, it is only reset if the pilot detunes the approach on the FMS or Control Unit or selects another approach. In the case of a last minute diversion to another airport, this may not be done in a timely fashion by the pilot or crew. Thus, an airport vicinity check is used to both start and stop CASPER-specific ADS-B communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The ADS-B integrity monitor checks the validity of the other ship ADS-B reports. The integrity monitor checks two things. First it checks how current the ADS-B report is. Second, it checks the validity of the data in the report. The ADS-B integrity flags are set based on the results of these checks in accordance with Table 4.

<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The age of the ADS-B report is an issue during two phases of the approach. When the aircraft is on the extended approach, i.e., Eligible mode, before the AILS separation algorithms are active, there is no need to use the ADS-B reports for separation. However, there should be some assurance that the ADS-B communications are working before the aircraft is transitioned to the Armed mode. A dropout of 15 seconds during the extended approach is the recommend maximum to be tolerated before declaring that ADS-B communication from another aircraft has stopped. Upon deeming ADS-B communication from another aircraft has stopped, the VERY OLD integrity status flag will be set to TRUE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The age of the ADS-B report is critical when the aircraft is in the Active mode, since the ADS-B navigation data is used by the AILS algorithms for self-separation. Using simulation analysis, Applicant has found that a dropout of approximately 6 seconds can be reasonably tolerated before declaring the ADS-B information for the other aircraft invalid and setting the OLD integrity status flag to TRUE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> It is difficult to provide an independent check on the information in the ADS-B message, since this is information provided by another aircraft about that aircraft. However, the radar range may be utilized as an independent check on the ADS-B position information. Radar slant range is accurate to about 100 feet after filtering, with a quantization error of another 125 feet. Since the HFOM and VFOM for own ship and other ship are known, a bound on the error between the radar slant range and computed ADS-B range may be established. It is important to take timing errors into account when setting the bound on the error. The recommended equation for setting the range check threshold is:

<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> OS represents own ship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> AJ represents adjacent ship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> HFOM and VFOM are expressed in meters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Range threshold is expressed in feet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Defective ADS-B data is handled in a manner consistent with the phase of the approach and the part of the data that is bad. If own ship is on the extended approach and is Eligible but not Active, ADS-B integrity is checked for every other ship that is Eligible. If all aircraft have VALID ADS-B integrity, own ship mode may be set to Armed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> If own ship is Active, ADS-B integrity is checked for every ship that is Active and a candidate or current CASPER pair, that is, an adjacent ship. If the other ship is a candidate CASPER pair and RANGE INVALID or OLD, the other ship remains a TCAS target. If the other aircraft is a current CASPER pair and RANGE INVALID, a missed approach is performed. An invalid range may be the result of problems with own ship or the other ship. The missed approach is performed for safety reasons in this situation as the source of the problem is generally indeterminable. If the other ship is a current CASPER pair and OLD, the other ship becomes a TCAS target. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Outputs from Mode S Box to TCAS Box </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The CASPER algorithms need own ship state and approach data and the Mode S identifier address from the Mode S box. Own ship data from the SLS/GNSSU is input to the TCAS box after first being input to the Mode S box and then going from the Mode S box to the TCAS box via the XT crosslink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The Mode S identifier address is currently a standard input into the TCAS box, and is used by the TCAS algorithms, so the signal format, units, and resolution are predefined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> When the own ship state and approach data is passed to the TCAS box via the XT crosslink, it should have the same signal, format, units, and resolution as it did when input to the Mode S box, with one exception. The assigned runway should be extracted from the Procedure message and only those bits passed into the TCAS box. The remainder of the inputs to the Mode S box from the SLS/GNSSU are not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> The ARINC labels may or may not be used. The XT crosslink has the ability to load data directly into registers, eliminating the need to use ARINC labels for some of the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Inputs to Mode S Box from TCAS Box </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The data transferred from the TCAS box to the Mode S box on the TX crosslink is not currently part of a standard product output. Thus, signal format and units, range, significant bits, and resolution of this data need to be defined and specified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The glideslope angle, threshold crossing height, datum point height, datum point latitude, and datum point longitude are standard inputs to the SLS, communicated from the ground via the VDLU link. Resolution, range, and units for this data may be the same as those for the SLS. The AILS path length and localizer slew angle are not part of the standard approach data, thus range and resolution for these data are determined by good operational judgment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The CASPER mode and CASPER ADS-B message control flags are the remaining data that need to be communicated from the TCAS Box to the Mode S box. The CASPER mode has four states, i.e., Equipped, Eligible, Armed, and Active. The CASPER ADS-B message control flag has two states (ON and OFF). Together, the CASPER mode and CASPER ADS-B message control flags utilize 3 bits of data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> CASPER Alerting Function </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> TCAS (Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System) is a collision avoidance system currently mandated for all aircraft in the U.S. with 20 passengers or more. TCAS provides important traffic alerting and resolution advisories, but the system is not designed for the special problem of aircraft on parallel approaches. The current TCAS, because of limitations of the surveillance technology, does not provide resolution advisories below 1,000 feet. In addition, TCAS will generate nuisance alerts for two aircraft on parallel approaches if they are within about 2,500 feet of one another, even if the approaches are blunder free. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The AILS algorithms within the CASPER system provide separation assurance for aircraft on parallel approaches. For aircraft that are CASPER targets (that is, aircraft for which CASPER alerting is being performed), the TCAS traffic and resolution advisories for those specific aircraft may be suppressed. In this manner, TCAS protection is maintained without extraneous traffic and resolution advisories. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> summarizes those instances where conventional TCAS alerting is utilized and where it may be appropriate to rely solely on CASPER alerting. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, own ship <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is depicted in relative position to a variety of other ships <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. Zone <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> defines a zone relative to own ship <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> where it would be appropriate to rely solely on CASPER alerting along a parallel approach. Outside of zone <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>, TCAS alerting would be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> With reference <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, and with further reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, zone <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> is generally defined as an area extending perpendicularly between own ship <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and a line parallel to parallel runway <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, wherein the line is laterally displaced from own ship <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> by a distance substantially equal to a separation distance between parallel runway <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and parallel runway <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. There is no absolute size or shape required for zone <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> inherent in the invention. Zone <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> is used as a decision tool to define when an adjacent ship will be monitored using the AILS algorithms for parallel approaches and when alternate alerting methods should be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Integrating the CASPER Algorithms with TCAS Overview </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The CASPER system contains logic to selectively identify the aircraft on which the AILS algorithms will be used, as well as the AILS algorithms for performing the collision avoidance function. A functional flow diagram outlining how the CASPER system integrates into TCAS hardware/software is provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> not only outlines the TCAS/CASPER interaction but also identifies functions required for the CASPER system which are also required for a &ldquo;TCAS-like&rdquo; ADS-B Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> separates functions which reside in the surveillance processor <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight>, from functions which reside in the CAS processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Surveillance processor <highlight><bold>1120</bold></highlight> contains surveillance function track file processing <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>, which supports TCAS, and ADS-B track file processing <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, which is specific to the CASPER system. Surveillance function track file processing <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> further contains aircraft track file elements <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for tracking information corresponding to individual other ships. ADS-B track file processing <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> further contains CASPER modification block <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and aircraft track file elements <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> for tracking data corresponding to individual other ships. Track file elements <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> contain information relative to a frame of reference corresponding to own ship, and commonly include the following data: range, range rate, bearing and altitude. Track file elements <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> contain information in a geographic coordinate system, such as WGS-84, and generally include the following data: UTC time, latitude, longitude, altitude, velocity (NED; North/East/Down), approach data and CASPER mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Surveillance function track file processing <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> accepts input from radar and provides output to CAS tracking block <highlight><bold>1150</bold></highlight>, which in turn provides output to CAS detection block <highlight><bold>1165</bold></highlight>. CAS detection block <highlight><bold>1165</bold></highlight> is coupled to display logic <highlight><bold>1170</bold></highlight> to provide output to display <highlight><bold>1180</bold></highlight> for auditory and/or visual observation by an observer, such as own ship pilot or crew, or ATC or other ground-based observer. Surveillance function track file processing <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> further provides output to function block <highlight><bold>1155</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> ADS-B track file processing <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> accepts input from received ADS-B messages and provides output to ARINC-429 formatting block <highlight><bold>1135</bold></highlight> and other ship conversion block <highlight><bold>1130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Own ship data <highlight><bold>1125</bold></highlight> accepts input from Mode-S box <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> (not shown) and provides output to own ship conversion block <highlight><bold>1140</bold></highlight> and time manager functions <highlight><bold>1145</bold></highlight>. Own ship data <highlight><bold>1125</bold></highlight> is similar to track file elements <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>, containing information relative to a geographic coordinate system, and including the following data: UTC time, latitude, longitude, altitude, velocity (NED) and approach data. Own ship data <highlight><bold>1125</bold></highlight> provides output to ARINC-429 formatting block <highlight><bold>1135</bold></highlight>, own ship conversion block <highlight><bold>1140</bold></highlight> and time manager functions <highlight><bold>1145</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Time manager functions <highlight><bold>1145</bold></highlight> accepts local time of PPS interrupts as an input, along with UTC time from own ship data <highlight><bold>1125</bold></highlight>. Time manager functions <highlight><bold>1145</bold></highlight> provide output to own ship conversion block <highlight><bold>1140</bold></highlight> and other ship conversion block <highlight><bold>1130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Other ship conversion block provides output to function block <highlight><bold>1150</bold></highlight> and computation block <highlight><bold>1160</bold></highlight>. Own ship conversion block further provides output to function block <highlight><bold>1150</bold></highlight> and computation block <highlight><bold>1160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Function block <highlight><bold>1155</bold></highlight> provides output to CAS detection block <highlight><bold>1165</bold></highlight> as well as display logic <highlight><bold>1170</bold></highlight>. Function block <highlight><bold>1155</bold></highlight> further provides ADS-B message control, mode and additional approach data to the Mode S box <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Additional details for each CASPER-related function of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> are provided in the following subsections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> ADS-B Track File Processing </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> A track file element <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> containing the ADS-B related information for each other ship is required. Track file elements <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> are similar to the track file elements <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> provided by the TCAS surveillance function from radar measurements, except the information is in a geographic coordinate system rather than a relative system. It is expected that the CASPER alerting system will require higher resolution and higher rate ADS-B messages than the standard extended squitters to avoid sacrificing safety, therefore a CASPER modification block <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> is shown in the ADS-B track file processing <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> to provide higher resolution data and rates in the ADS-B messages. In addition to position and velocity squitters, the CASPER alerting system will also broadcast approach and mode data. Messages related to these CASPER-specific broadcasts are received, formatted and stored within the track file elements <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Currently, every aircraft equipped with a Mode S transponder spontaneously radiates, i.e., squitters, its unique Mode S address once per second in a 56-bit burst at 1090 MHZ. TCAS uses this information to detect the presence of nearby aircraft equipped with Mode S transponders. The GPS-squitter concept, also known as extended squitter, adds two additional 112-bit squitter messages. One message is radiated every half second and contains GPS position and barometric altitude when the aircraft is airborne; or position, heading, and speed when the aircraft is on the surface. The other message is radiated every five seconds and contains the aircraft flight number, or the aircraft tail number for general aviation aircraft. Existing Mode S transponders can easily be modified to transmit squitter messages aside from, or in addition to, the conventional or extended squitter messages. A software change to the transponder is all that is required. Such software changes are within the abilities of one of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Own Ship Data </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Input for own ship data <highlight><bold>1125</bold></highlight> is received from Mode S box <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> through the own ship TCAS crosslink messages <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> across the TCAS XT input bus. Own ship data <highlight><bold>1125</bold></highlight> contain a UTC time-tag, position, velocity and approach data similar to the ADS-B data received for other aircraft. The own ship CASPER mode is computed in the CAS processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> and should be retrieved and attached with the own ship data received from Mode S box <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> ADS-B ARINC-429 Output </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The contents of the track file elements <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> and own ship data <highlight><bold>1125</bold></highlight> is output on an ARINC-429 data bus. This allows ADS-B applications to reside in external devices, if data latency does not become a limiting factor. After receipt of a contiguous block of labels, the Mode S identifier can be inspected to identify the ship providing the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Time Manager Functions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The purpose of the time manager functions <highlight><bold>1145</bold></highlight> is to provide the ability to convert UTC time to the local processor (CAS processor) time or vice versa. This is accomplished by time tagging the time mark interrupt sent from the Global Navigation System Sensor Unit (GNSSU) with a local time, and correlating that local time with the UTC time for the interrupt received over the Mode S input bus. The UTC time will be latent, so care must be given to match the interrupt with the proper UTC data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Mode Logic/Integrity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The CASPER mode logic/integrity function within function block <highlight><bold>1155</bold></highlight> serves as the CASPER executive within the CAS processor <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight>. The CASPER mode logic/integrity function is detailed in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. An attempt has been made in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to distinguish between logic and actions. Logical statements/functions are enclosed within rectangular boxes while action enclosures are rounded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> provides the elements and actions taken to determine if the system is CASPER equipped. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> logical function <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> is encountered to determine if the own ship is CASPER equipped. Logical function <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> can be a discrete, such as a hardware input or a software switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> If it is determined that the own ship is equipped, the CASPER mode is set to Equipped in action box <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> and a call is made to the CASPER processing module in action box <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight>. The discrete or software switch is checked at the 1 Hz rate of the CASPER alerting system to enable a 1 Hz call to the CASPER processing module detailed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Recall that the CASPER mode is output in the Mode S identifier block. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> A flow diagram of the CASPER processing module logic is provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. CASPER processing begins with action box <highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight>. At logical function <highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight> evaluates whether a CASPER SLS approach is selected. If not, control is transferred to action box <highlight><bold>1345</bold></highlight> to set the mode to Equipped. If the approach is selected, logical function <highlight><bold>1315</bold></highlight> evaluates whether own ship is within the vicinity of the airport. If not, control is transferred to action box <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight> to set the mode to Equipped. If within the vicinity, logical function <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight> evaluates whether the VDLU approaches and corrections are received. If not, control is transferred to action box <highlight><bold>1355</bold></highlight> to set the mode to Equipped. If VDLU approached and corrections are received, logical function <highlight><bold>1325</bold></highlight> evaluates whether the navigation FOMs are within DGPS navigation limits. If not, control is transferred to action box <highlight><bold>1345</bold></highlight> to set the mode to Equipped. If the FOMs are within limits, action box <highlight><bold>1330</bold></highlight> sets the mode to Eligible, action box <highlight><bold>1335</bold></highlight> initiates CASPER-specific ADS-B messaging and action box <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight> makes a call to ADS-B track file processing. Control from action boxes <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1345</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1355</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1360</bold></highlight> all transfers to action box <highlight><bold>1365</bold></highlight> to return to the calling program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The logic/executive flow for other ship track file processing is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. This flow diagram represents an inner loop to process information for all other ships for which an ADS-B message has been received. This processing includes an ADS-B integrity check, logic to change mode from Eligible to Armed or Active, determination of CASPER pairs, and a call to execute the AILS separation assurance algorithms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Other ship track file processing begins at action box <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight>. At action box <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight>, the track file is incremented to process a new, or the next, other ship. Logical function <highlight><bold>1406</bold></highlight> evaluates whether the new other ship is available, i.e., if any remaining other ships have yet to be processed. If processing of all available other ships is complete, control is passed to action box <highlight><bold>1408</bold></highlight> to return to action box <highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight>. If the new other ship is available, logical function <highlight><bold>1410</bold></highlight> evaluates whether the other ship mode is Eligible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> If the other ship mode not Eligible, logical function <highlight><bold>1412</bold></highlight> determines whether that other ship is a CASPER pair. If not, logical function <highlight><bold>1454</bold></highlight> determines whether the other ship is designated as a valid target. If it is designated as a valid target, action box <highlight><bold>1456</bold></highlight> removes the designation and decrements the number of valid targets as the other ship is no longer transmitting tracking information when in Eligible mode. If the other ship is not designated as a valid target, action box <highlight><bold>1450</bold></highlight> maintains the other ship as a TCAS target. If the other ship is a CASPER pair in logical function <highlight><bold>1412</bold></highlight>, action box <highlight><bold>1452</bold></highlight> indicates the need for an EEM due to the uncertainties surrounding the other ship&apos;s tracking information in light of the discontinuance of data transmissions. If the other ship mode is Eligible, logical function <highlight><bold>1414</bold></highlight> evaluates whether the ADS-B messaging is VERY OLD. If VERY OLD, control is passed to logical function <highlight><bold>1412</bold></highlight>. If not VERY OLD, logical function <highlight><bold>1416</bold></highlight> determines whether the TCAS range is available. If not available, control is passed to logical function <highlight><bold>1424</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> If the TCAS range is available in logical function <highlight><bold>1416</bold></highlight>, logical function <highlight><bold>1418</bold></highlight> determines whether the range is INVALID. Range validity is determined by comparing the ADS-B derived range to a TCAS derived range. If the difference between the two ranges is greater than a threshold, the range is declared INVALID. The threshold is preferably about 100 m. If the range is INVALID, control is passed to logical function <highlight><bold>1412</bold></highlight>. If the range is not INVALID, logical function <highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight> determines whether the other ship is designated as a valid target. If not, action box <highlight><bold>1422</bold></highlight> designates the other ship as a valid target and increments the number of tracked targets, and passes control to logical function <highlight><bold>1424</bold></highlight>. If the other ship is already a valid target, control is passed to logical function <highlight><bold>1424</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Logical function <highlight><bold>1424</bold></highlight> determines if the number of valid targets is greater than zero. If the number of valid targets is zero, action box <highlight><bold>1426</bold></highlight> sets the CASPER mode for the other ship in the track file as Eligible. If the number of valid targets is greater than zero, logical function <highlight><bold>1428</bold></highlight> determines whether the CASPER mode of the other ship is Active. If not, action box <highlight><bold>1430</bold></highlight> sets the CASPER mode for the other ship to Armed. If already Active, logical function <highlight><bold>1432</bold></highlight> determines whether own ship is downrange of the other ship and within the AILS path length. In not downrange and within the AILS path length, action box <highlight><bold>1434</bold></highlight> sets the CASPER mode for the other ship to Armed and transfers control to action box <highlight><bold>1450</bold></highlight>. If downrange and within the AILS path length, action box <highlight><bold>1436</bold></highlight> sets the CASPER mode of the other ship to Active. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Upon setting the mode to Active, logical function <highlight><bold>1438</bold></highlight> determines whether the other ship is a CASPER pair to own ship. If not, control is passed to action box <highlight><bold>1450</bold></highlight>. If the other ship is a CASPER pair, action box <highlight><bold>1440</bold></highlight> designates the other ship as a CASPER pair. Logical function <highlight><bold>1442</bold></highlight> determines whether the ADS-B messaging is OLD for the designated CASPER pair. If OLD, action box <highlight><bold>1444</bold></highlight> indicates the need for an EEM followed by action box <highlight><bold>1448</bold></highlight> to deselect the other ship as a valid target, decrement the number of valid targets and deselect the other ship as a CASPER pair. Control is then passed to action box <highlight><bold>1450</bold></highlight>. If ADS-B messaging is not OLD, AILS separation assurance algorithms are utilized in action box <highlight><bold>1446</bold></highlight> to evaluate whether the other ship is a threat to own ship. Control is then returned to action box <highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight> to repeat the processing for the next other ship. Additional detail on the processing of the separation assurance algorithms is provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Action box <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight> signals the initiation of AILS processing. Logical function <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight> first determines whether the other ship is on a MAP or EEM. If the other ship is not on a MAP or EEM, logical function <highlight><bold>1515</bold></highlight> determines whether own ship is on a MAP or EEM. If own ship is also not on a MAP or EEM, action box <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight> executes the separation assurance algorithms. If either the other ship or own ship are on a MAP or EEM, a modified set of separation assurance algorithms are performed in action box <highlight><bold>1525</bold></highlight>. The modified set of separation assurance algorithms use actual states rather than intent for the ship the is executing the MAP or EEM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Upon executing either of the separation assurance algorithms on the tracking information, logical function <highlight><bold>1530</bold></highlight> determines whether a warning alert occurred as a result of the algorithms. If no warning occurred, logical function <highlight><bold>1540</bold></highlight> determines whether a caution has occurred. If no caution has occurred, control is passed to action box <highlight><bold>1545</bold></highlight> to repeat the separation algorithm processing. If a caution has occurred, action box <highlight><bold>1570</bold></highlight> sets the other ship caution alert to true for output to the display logic function <highlight><bold>1170</bold></highlight> for alerting an observer. Control is passed to action box <highlight><bold>1545</bold></highlight> to repeat the processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> If a warning occurred in logical function <highlight><bold>1530</bold></highlight>, logical function <highlight><bold>1535</bold></highlight> determines whether the CAS tracking function of TCAS is active on the particular other ship. If true, the CAS detection inhibit for that other ship is removed in action box <highlight><bold>1550</bold></highlight> and a check for how long the warning has persisted is made in logical function <highlight><bold>1560</bold></highlight>. If the warning has persisted for five seconds, the TCAS alert inhibit is removed in action box <highlight><bold>1565</bold></highlight> and TCAS is allowed to attempt to resolve the conflict using it&apos;s cooperative altitude resolution. Control is then passed to action box <highlight><bold>1545</bold></highlight>. If the CAS tracking function of TCAS is not active, or the warning has not extended beyond the preferred maximum time, control is passed to action box <highlight><bold>1555</bold></highlight>. Action box <highlight><bold>1555</bold></highlight> sets the other ship warning alert to true for output to display logic <highlight><bold>1170</bold></highlight> for alerting an observer.
