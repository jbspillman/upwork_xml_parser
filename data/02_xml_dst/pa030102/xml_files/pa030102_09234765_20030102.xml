<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The field of art to which this invention relates is cryptographic communication. Specifically, this invention provides a method based on physical principles for secretly distributing two sets of binary encryption keys that can be used to encrypt publicly transmitted messages between two parties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, to establish a secret channel between two parties and two parties only, there are three possible solutions. The first method is to use a secret courier who can deliver the message with secrecy. The second method involves the case, that is referred to as the &ldquo;Public Key.&rdquo; In this case party A and party B publicly establish a mutual agreement over two prime numbers p and q. Party A then chooses a secret number x and publicly transmits a public number p<highlight><superscript>x </superscript></highlight>(mod q) to party B. Similarly, party B chooses a secret number y and transmits a number p<highlight><superscript>y </superscript></highlight>(mod q) to A. Party A then computes the number (p<highlight><superscript>y</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>x</superscript></highlight>&equals;p<highlight><superscript>x y </superscript></highlight>(mod q) and Party B computes the number (p<highlight><superscript>x</superscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>y</superscript></highlight>&equals;p<highlight><superscript>x y </superscript></highlight>(mod q). Using this method, a mutually identical key can be established. The secrecy in this method is guaranteed only by the assumption that a third party does not possess the computing power to factorize the numbers. Both the first and second methods are well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The third method is often referred to as &ldquo;Quantum Cryptography.&rdquo; The basic principle of operation for &ldquo;Quantum Cryptography&rdquo; can be summarized as follows. Sender A prepares a twin-particle quantum mechanical state. Such a state consists of two and only two quantum mechanical particles (x and y) (e.g., photons). The state is prepared in such a way that they fall into the general class of &ldquo;Entangled Quantum States.&rdquo; Such a state possesses the property that the behavior of particle X is closely related to that of particle y. For example, if one prepares such a state and measures whether photon x is left or right-hand polarized. The result is closely related to the result if one were to perform a simultaneous measurement of such properties on particle y. In a special case (referred to as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state), the handiness of the polarization of the particles x and y are always opposite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> After preparing the entangled two-particle quantum state, the sender (A) sends one particle (x) through a channel to a receiver (B). The receiver at the right moment after receiving the particle (x), decides to rotate its polarization by 90&deg; (denoting a binary &ldquo;1&rdquo;) or do nothing (denoting a binary &ldquo;0&rdquo;) and send the particle (x) back to the original sender (A). Upon receiving the particle (x) back from B, the original sender (A) can perform two identical measurements on both particles x and y, using a variety of polarization bases. If the outcome of the two measurements are the same for both particles (x and y), the sender (A) can conclude that the receiver (B) replied to the sender (A) a binary number &ldquo;0&rdquo;. If the outcome of the two measurements are rotated by 90&deg;, then a binary number &ldquo;1&rdquo; is registered. Since there is only one quantum x (e.g., a photon) that is sent at a time when one bit of a secret key string is communicated, if the photon (x) is captured or tampered with by an eavesdropper (C), the polarization properties of the photon will be lost. Hence the method is safe from eavesdropping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Prior art schemes which utilize Quantum Cryptography use laser sources instead of a single photon pair source, and therefore cannot be considered a true quantum cryptographic communication channel. While these schemes have their advantages, they are plagued by the following disadvantages: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> 1. The prior art schemes do not provide a secret communication channel between two and only two parties by using a single photon to carry the binary key string information, hence, they do not preserve secrecy based on physical principles; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> 2. The prior art uses a single particle&apos;s polarization entanglement state which requires one of the two entangled particles to travel through the distance between the two communicating parties twice, during this long distance, any disturbance to the pathway channel (i.e., thermally or mechanically induced birefringence) obstructs the polarization of the communication channel and introduces error; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> 3. The prior art uses a single particle&apos;s polarization entanglement state which is prone to naturally occurring birefringence, which can also obstruct the communication channel and introduce error; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> 4. The prior art uses a phase modulation for communication which is required to be preserved for twice the long communication pathway length which is particularly prone to external disturbance (i.e., thermal or acoustic disturbances that are fast enough to cause an inhomogeneous change to the pathway (fiber channel) length during the entire communication period), again this affects the communication channel and introduces error. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention resolves all of the above problems by communicating through a conventional pathway channel using the quantum coherence properties between two single photon sources, and in particular is based upon the physical principle that the quantum mechanical state of a single quantum, if unknown, cannot be copied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a quantum cryptographic communication channel is provided. The quantum cryptographic communication channel comprises: a light source; directing means; first and second sources each capable of generating a pair of photons emitted in the form of signal and idler light beams when energized by the light source, the first and second sources being arranged relative to each other such that the idler beam from the first source is incident upon the second source and aligned into the idler beam of the second source and the signal beams are directed by the directing means to converge upon a common point; a light modulator for changing the phase of the idler beam from the first source between first and second phase settings before being incident upon the second source; a controller for controlling the timing of the phase change from the first phase setting to the second phase setting; first and second detectors for detecting the incidence of the signal beams from the first and second sources; and a beam splitter disposed at the common point for directing the signal beams to the first detector when the phase of the idler beam from the first source has the first phase setting and to the second detector when the phase of the idler beam from the first source has the second phase setting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the detection of the signal beams at the first detector corresponds to a first logical value and the detection of the signal beams at the second detector corresponds to a second logical value wherein the controller controls the timing of the phase change from the first phase setting to the second phase setting corresponding to the first and second logical values, respectively, to thereby transmit a cryptographic key string comprising a plurality of the first and second logical values.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Before discussing the preferred implementation of the present invention in detail, a general overview of the physical principles behind the present invention will be discussed with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a single photon originating from each one of first and second sources <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Both sources <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are second order non-linear crystals that are operated as &ldquo;parametric down-converters&rdquo; and generate a pair of photons that are emitted simultaneously in the form of light beams called &ldquo;signal&rdquo; and &ldquo;idler&rdquo; beams, designated s and i, respectively, i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> being the idler and signal beams from the first source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and i<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> being the idler and signal beams from the second source <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Second order non-linear crystals, their operation modes as parametric down-converters, and signal and idler beams are well known in the art and therefore a detailed description of them is omitted in the interests of brevity. When the system settings are adjusted such that either the first source is emitting a pair of photons (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) or the second source is emitting a pair of photons (s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and i<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), a special situation occurs under the special arrangement illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. When the path lengths of all the beams (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, i<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are well adjusted and the first and second idler beams (i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, i<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are aligned into each other, the first and second signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photons upon entering a beam splitter (BS) <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> will exit from the same side. When the signal beam path length is adjusted to be different by half of the wavelength (a 180&deg; phase shift) of the signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photons, all of the signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photons upon arriving at the BS <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> will exit from the opposite side of the BS <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, a 180&deg; phase shift introduced to the first idler beam (ii) between the two sources <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> has the identical effect of switching the signal beams (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) into the opposite sides of the BS <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In other words, the first and second identical nonlinear crystal sources <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are optically pumped by two strong pulsed pump waves, preferably from a single laser source (not shown). When the phase matching conditions are met, down-conversion occurs either at the first source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with the simultaneous emission of the first signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and idler beam (i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) photons, or at the second source <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> with the emission of the second signal beam (s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and idler beam (i<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photons at a time later. The first idler beam (i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is aligned through the second source <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and into the second idler beam (i<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) mode with a path length C&tgr;<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>between the first and second sources <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, where c&equals;speed of light, and &tgr;<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>&equals;optical delay between the first and second sources <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The first signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) from the first source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is reflected to the BS <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> located at a common point at which the first and second signal beams (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) intersect by mirror <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The first and second signal beams (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are combined at the BS <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> with the two optical paths of abd and cd of lengths c&tgr;<highlight><subscript>s1 </subscript></highlight>and c&tgr;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, respectively. A light modulator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is inserted into the first idler beam (i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) path to control its phase setting between first and second phase settings, preferably, of between a 180&deg; or a 0&deg; phase shift as controlled by driver <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. However, it is understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, that the light modulator could alternatively be in the path of one of the signal beams (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). When the optical paths are balanced, namely, when &tgr;<highlight><subscript>s1</subscript></highlight>&minus;&tgr;<highlight><subscript>s2</subscript></highlight>&equals;&tgr;<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to within the coherence lengths of the first and second signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and first and second idler beam (i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, i<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photons, interference effect occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The interference effect is well known in the art, thus we only emphasize two key features for brevity. The first is that by controlling the phase of the communication channel one can control the probabilities for all the photons to exit from one port (or side) or an opposite port of the beam splitter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in a deterministic fashion. The other key feature is if any part of the communication channel pathways, i.e., paths following beams s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, are tampered with in any fashion, the photons arriving at the beam splitter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> will exit randomly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when the path lengths are well adjusted, the interference effect switches the first and second signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photons to both arrive at a first detector <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> when there is a 180&deg; phase shift and to a second detector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> when there is a 0&deg; phase shift. Thus, the beam splitter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> directs the signal beams (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) to the first detector <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> when the phase of the first idler beam (i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) has a 180&deg; phase shift and to the second detector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> when the phase of the first idler beam (i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) has a 0&deg; phase shift. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> By controlling the phase of the apparatus illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the direction of the first and second signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photons, from the BS <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can be controlled. This special behavior is valid only under the condition that all three light pathways, namely, the first and second signal beams (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and the first idler beam (i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) are open and not disturbed externally. Any external disturbance (eavesdropping) will obscure the certainty in the signal photon&apos;s directionality. Therefore, by periodically testing whether the first and second signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photons can be directed with high certainty, the communication channel can be tested to determine if it has been compromised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the preferred implementation of the present invention is illustrated and referred to generally by reference numeral <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, wherein like elements to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are referred to with like reference numerals. The system has a &ldquo;sender&rdquo; side <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and a &ldquo;receiver&rdquo; side <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. However, it should be appreciated by someone skilled in the art that each &ldquo;side&rdquo; can have both a receiver and a sender such that the signal beams (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) can be either transmitted or received. The sender side <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> consists primarily of an apparatus to produce the coherently superposed quantum state for a single photon. The receiver side <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> consists primarily of an analyzer apparatus. The sender <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the receiver <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are linked via a fiber optical channel <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> for the cryptographic key transmission and a public channel (an insecure data line) <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> for the purpose of verifications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Sender Side </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A light source <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, preferably a mode-locked laser produces a short-wavelength laser pulse train that is used to pump the first and second second-order nonlinear crystal sources <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Preferably the laser is directly incident on one of the crystal sources <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and is reflected onto the other crystal source <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> by way of a mirroring arrangement, such as by mirrors <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. However, any arrangement to provide the laser beam onto both sources <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be used without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> By choosing the appropriate phase-matching conditions, each of the first and second sources <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can produce a pair of down-converted signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and idler beam (i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, i<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photons. The first idler beam (i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) from the first source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is aligned into the same mode of propagation as the second idler beam (i<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) from the second source <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A first light modulator <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> driven by a voltage-control module <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is inserted into the first idler beam(i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). The combined idler beam mode of propagation (i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and i<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is aligned into an idler beam single-photon detector <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, such as a single-photon avalanche photo diode detector whose output is used as a condition signal for the encryption key string transmission. The first light modulator <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is capable of producing either a 180&deg; or a 0&deg; phase shift depending on the control signal from a sender&apos;s computer <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and is timed with a derived signal from a master clock <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> which is synchronized with the mode-locked laser <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The first signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) from the first source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is reflected from a mirror <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and directed into a first polarized beam-splitter (PBS) <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> located at a first common point <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>. Its polarization is so arranged that the first signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) is always transmitted through the first PBS <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> into a second light modulator <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. The second signal beam (s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) from the second source <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> goes through a first half-wave plate (&lgr;/2) <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> such that its polarization is rotated by 90&deg; before being incident upon mirror <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, which directs the second signal beam (s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) to the first PBS <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. Hence, the second signal beam (s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) upon entering the first PBS <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is always reflected into the same spatial mode of propagation as the first signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and also enters the second light modulator <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. The second light modulator <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> is controlled by a voltage driver <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> which can rotate the polarization of the first and second signal beams (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) at its entrance by 90&deg; or by 0&deg;. The rotation is controlled by a timing signal from the sender computer <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> that is synchronized with the master clock <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the clock signals are arranged in such a fashion that at the time when a first signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) photon arrives at the second light modulator <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, its polarization is not rotated. Furthermore, if the arriving signal photon were a second signal beam (s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photon, after it has already been rotated by the first half-wave plate (&lgr;/2) <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to enter the second PBS <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, its polarization is rotated by 90&deg; by the second light modulator <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and hence restored. Because the first and second signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photons are generated at different times, there exists a time window in which the necessary polarization rotation can be performed. Therefore, independent of where the signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photon is coming from (source <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>), only a time-delay will exist between the signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photons; their polarization states will be the same. Upon exiting from the second light modulator <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, the single mode of propagation consisting of both the first and second signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are focussed with a first lens <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> into the single mode fiber <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> for transmission to the receiver side <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The master clock signal, after proper electronic re-shaping and proper delay adjustment is also sent to the receiver side <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> for synchronization via the data line <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The master clock signal need only be sent to the receiver side once for initial synchronization; both the sender and receiver sides can control the transmission and reception via local clocks. An electronic flag signal indicating the successful detection of a first or second idler beam (i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, i<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photon is also sent to the receiver side <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> via the data line <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Receiver Side </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The receiver side <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is constructed with an analyzing apparatus. Upon receiving the single photon superposition states (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) through the fiber channel <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the timing signal through the data line <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the receiver&apos;s computer clock <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> sends out a timed signal to a third light modulator <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> via a third driver <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the first and second controllers <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> can be synchronized by the master clock <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and the third controller <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> can be initially synchronized by the master clock <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and thereafter synchronized by the receiver side clock <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Thus, the master clock <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and receiver side clock <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are in a master/slave relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The third light modulator <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> performs the following function. The clock signals are arranged in such a fashion that at the time when a first signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) photon arrives at the third light modulator <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, its polarization is unaltered. A short time delay later, for an arriving second signal beam (s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photon, its polarization is rotated by 90&deg;. Therefore, a first signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) photon will proceed to transmit through a second polarized beam-splitter (PBS) <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and go into a well-adjusted delay. A second signal beam (s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photon is reflected from the second PBS <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and then through a second half-wave plate (&lgr;/2) <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> and enters a lower arm of the receiver <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the first and second signal beams (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), before entering the second PBS <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> are collimated therein by a second lens system <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>. The first and second signal beams (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are directed to a second common point <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> at which a beam splitter (BS) <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> is disposed, preferably by a mirror arrangement, such as by mirrors <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. With a proper time adjustment, the first and second signal beams (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) interfere. Therefore, if the phase shift produced at the first light modulator <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is set at 0&deg;, all signal beam photons (either an s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or an s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) will exit into one side of a beam splitter (BS) <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> and be detected by a first signal beam single-photon detector <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. Conversely, if the first light modulator <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is set at phase 180&deg;, all signal photons (either an s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or an s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) will exit from the other side of the BS <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> and be detected by a second signal beam single-photon detector <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. By detecting whether the first or the second signal beam single-photon detectors <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> have registered a photon, the receiver <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can determine if the sender has sent a logical value of &ldquo;1&rdquo; or &ldquo;0&rdquo;. A string of logical values, such as &ldquo;1&apos;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;0&apos;s&rdquo; in a binary system, comprises the encryption key string. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Error Detection and Correction </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The sender <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the receiver <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can actively lock the path length difference by using conventional locking techniques known in the art. In this way, the error due to the path length difference at both sender and receiver sides <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can be reduced. Furthermore, the sender <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the receiver <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can detect errors in the signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) transmission and correct such errors by abandoning the failed transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the following, the conditions in which both parties (sender and receiver <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>) can rectify the key string communication results is discussed. First, the sender <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> uses the detection of the first and second idler beam (i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, i<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photons by the idler beam single-photon detector <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> as a condition for a successful communication. Only under the condition of a successful detection of a first and second idler beam (i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, i<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photon by the idler beam detector <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the sender <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> sends a flag signal to the receiver <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> under which a detection by either of the first or second signal beam single-photon detectors <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> will be registered. Second, only under the condition when the receiver side <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> detects a first or second signal beam (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photon by either the first or second signal beam single-photon detector <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, a flag signal is sent back to the sender <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> via the conventional data line <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to indicate the successful detection. Combined with the flag signal for the detection of a first or second idler beam (i<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, i<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) photon, the communication is marked successful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Next, the key string transmission is compared and verified. At this step, the conditions of transmission between the sender and receiver <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are compared through a conventional channel. When there is a discrepancy, the necessary phase change is adjusted to ensure that the encryption key string transmission occurs at a higher successful rate. Furthermore, a testing procedure for the secret encryption key string transmission can be employed to test every bit of the encryption key string transmission. Using such a method, the successfully transmitted encryption key bits are identified and kept and the unsuccessful ones identified and abandoned. Finally, testing procedures can also be employed to test the entire communication channel and determine if an eavesdropper exists. Such a testing procedure preferably employs a scheme where the sender <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> prepares a quantum state (using an algorithm to generate an arbitrary phase sequence) and sends that state to the receiver <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. After a number of repetitions, the sender <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and receiver <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> compare the results. If there is a discrepancy, one can conclude that the communication channel is compromised. Otherwise, the communication is secure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> One skilled in the art can appreciate that the communication of the present invention is one-way. Namely, the sender (<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>) selects a certain binary value for a specific bit in the key string and accordingly sets the phase value for the overall pathway to achieve that value. A testing procedure is preferably first run to ensure the phase relations between the sender side <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the receiver side <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is identical. After which, the system is calibrated. In the present invention, since both the first and second signal beams (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) go through the same fiber pathway (fiber link <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>), any external disturbance to the fiber <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> carrying the first and second signal beams (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) will not result in an overall phase relation change between the two signal beams because, in practice, the two signal beams are only separated by a few nanoseconds in time inside the fiber <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> to allow demultiplexing. Such a short time delay is far too short to be affected by any thermal, mechanical, or acoustic disturbances. Therefore, both the first and second signal beams (s<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, s<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) will experience the same effect due to any external disturbance to the fiber pathway <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and hence their path length difference or the relative phase is preserved. Furthermore, as can be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the present invention does not rely on the preservation of the polarization of a quantum mechanical state which eliminates the aforementioned disadvantages of the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> While there has been shown and described what is considered to be preferred embodiments of the invention, it will, of course, be understood that various modifications and changes in form or detail could readily be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. It is therefore intended that the invention be not limited to the exact forms described and illustrated, but should be constructed to cover all modifications that may fall within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
