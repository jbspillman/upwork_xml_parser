<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to field emitter display (FED) assemblies, and to methods of forming field emitter display (FED) assemblies. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Flat-panel displays are widely used to visually display information where the physical thickness and bulk of a conventional cathode ray tube is unacceptable or impractical. Portable electronic devices and systems have benefitted from the use of flat-panel displays, which require less space and result in a lighter, more compact display system than provided by conventional cathode ray tube technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention described below is concerned primarily with field emission flat-panel displays or FEDs. In a field emission flat-panel display, an electron emitting cathode plate is separated from a display face or face plate at a relatively small, uniform distance. The intervening space between these elements is evacuated. Field emission displays have the outward appearance of a CRT except that they are very thin. While being simple, they are also capable of very high resolutions. In some cases they can be assembled by use of technology already used in integrated circuit production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Field emission flat-panel displays utilize field emission devices, in groups or individually, to emit electrons that energize a cathodoluminescent material deposited on a surface of a viewing screen or display face plate. The emitted electrons originate from an emitter or cathode electrode at a region of geometric discontinuity having a sharp edge or tip. Electron emission is induced by application of potentials of appropriate polarization and magnitude to the various electrodes of the field emission device display, which are typically arranged in a two-dimensional matrix array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Field emission display devices differ operationally from cathode ray tube displays in that information is not impressed onto the viewing screen by means of a scanned electron beam, but rather by selectively controlling the electron emission from individual emitters or select groups of emitters in an array. This is commonly known as &ldquo;pixel addressing.&rdquo; Various displays are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,655,940, 5,661,531, 5,754,149, 5,563,470, and 5,598,057 the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-sectional view of an exemplary field emission display (FED) device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a face plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a base plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and spacers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extending between base plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and face plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to maintain face plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in spaced relation relative to base plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Face plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, base plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and spacers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can comprise, for example, glass. Phosphor regions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are associated with face plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and separated from face plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a transparent conductive layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Transparent conductive layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can comprise, for example, indium tin oxide or tin oxide. Phosphor regions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprise phosphor-containing masses. Each of phosphor regions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can comprise a different color phosphor. Typically, the phosphor regions comprise either red, green or blue phosphor. A black matrix material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is provided to separate phosphor regions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from one another. The three phosphor colors (red, green, and blue) can be utilized to generate a wide array of screen colors by simultaneously stimulating one or more of the red, green and blue regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Base plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has emitter regions <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> associated therewith. The emitter regions comprise emitters or field emitter tips <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which are located within apertures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (only some of which are labeled) formed through a conductive gate layer or row line <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and a lower insulating layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Emitters <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are typically about 1 micron high, and are separated from base plate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by a conductive layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Emitters <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and apertures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are connected with circuitry (not shown) enabling column and row addressing of the emitters <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and apertures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A voltage source <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is provided to apply a voltage differential between emitters <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and surrounding gate apertures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Application of such voltage differential causes electron streams <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to be emitted toward phosphor regions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> respectively. Conductive layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is charged to a potential higher than that applied to gate layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and thus functions as an anode toward which the emitted electrons accelerate. Once the emitted electrons contact phosphor dots associated with regions <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> light is emitted. As discussed above, the emitters <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are typically matrix addressable via circuitry. Emitters <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can thus be selectively activated to display a desired image on the phosphor-coated screen of face plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The emitter tips are typically connected to a conductive column line for energizing selected tips. Further, current limiting resistors, typically comprising doped silicon or silicon-containing material are positioned intermediate the emitter tips and column lines to reduce current and avoid burning up the emitter tips. Various aspects of current-limiting resistors and, more generally, field emitter display assemblies are described in the following U.S. patents, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,712,534, 5,642,017, 5,644,195, 5,652,181, and 5,663,742. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, various aspects of a field emitter display (FED) assembly in accordance with the prior art are described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> substrate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is provided and has a plurality of column lines <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> formed or supported thereover. The substrate can comprise any suitable substrate, with exemplary substrate materials being disclosed in one or more of the patents incorporated by reference in this document. Column lines <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> typically comprise a conductive material such as a conductive metal. Exemplary materials can include materials which are disclosed in one or more of the patents incorporated by reference in this document. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> plurality of resistor islands <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are formed over the conductive lines. Resistor islands <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> typically comprise a silicon-containing material such as polysilicon. Other materials can be used. The resistor islands can be formed through suitable patterning and etching techniques which are known. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</cross-reference>, individual resistor islands <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are received entirely within their associated column lines <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In addition, a plurality of discrete resistors are formed for each column line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 7</cross-reference>, field emitter regions <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are formed over resistor islands <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in accordance with known techniques described in one or more of the above patents. One or more field emitter regions can be formed for each resistor island. The field emitter regions, as perhaps best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, comprise a plurality of field emitter tips <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, conductive grids or row lines <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are formed over the substrate in accordance with known techniques. A plurality of windows <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are provided through grid <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The windows expose the individual field emitter regions <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Each window defines a single pixel having 100 or more field emitter tips thereon. Each individual resistor island <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is received completely within their associated illustrated window. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Up to now, problems have existed in such constructions regarding current leakage arcs and shorts between row and column lines, e.g. grid <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and column lines <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, even though such lines are spaced and separated by a dielectric insulator material. These shorts and leakage arcs can be most pronounced at the edges of the row and column lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, this invention arose out of concerns associated with providing improved field emitter display (FED) assemblies and methods of forming field emitter display (FED) assemblies. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> This disclosure of the invention is submitted in furtherance of the constitutional purposes of the U.S. Patent Laws &ldquo;to promote the progress of science and useful arts&rdquo; (Article 1, Section 8). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, one or more embodiments of the present invention are shown. Like numerals from the above-described prior art embodiment are utilized where appropriate, with differences being indicated by the suffix &ldquo;a&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, field emitter display (FED) assembly is provided and includes a substrate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of column lines <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which are formed and supported thereby. A plurality of field emitter tip regions <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) are disposed in operable proximity to individual column lines <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. At least some of the individual regions define different pixels of the display. In this illustrated example, each separate field emitter tip region <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> comprises a different pixel of the display, as will become apparent below. A continuous resistor, and preferably a plurality of continuous resistors <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 13</cross-reference>) are provided. In this example, and as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, resistor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is interposed between column line <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and at least two different pixels comprised of the field emitter tip regions <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, resistor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> comprises a silicon-containing material, and preferably a silicon-containing material containing a conductivity-modifying impurity. Exemplary materials and impurities are described in one or more of the patents incorporated by reference above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, at least two different pixels have individual lengths, and resistor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has a length which is no less than the combined lengths of the two different pixels. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the rightmost pixels each have a length l.
