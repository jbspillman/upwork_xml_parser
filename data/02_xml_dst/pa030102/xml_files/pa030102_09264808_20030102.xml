<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Remote data entry is performed in such a manner that a plurality of entry items and a plurality of data items are caused to collectively enter within one communication and the check sum is calculated simultaneously with the data entry so that abnormality of the data is easily detected even if the contents of the entry data are changed due to the abnormality occurring in a facsimile apparatus. Data is collectively stored in a receiving buffer and a great quantity of data is caused to remote enter if the capacity of the buffer permits. After all remote data entries have been completed, the check sums of all entry memory regions are performed so that the memory capacity of the program code of the check sum is saved. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a data communication system between computers and facsimile machines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Hitherto, a multiplicity of entry information items must be caused to enter a facsimile machine, for example, shortened dials, user&apos;s telephone numbers, abbreviated names and the like. The foregoing information has been manually caused to enter and read output by a service person or a user. Further, investigations and adjustments have been performed by the service man who has visited the place where the facsimile machine is place. The internal information in the facsimile machine has been read output and setting has been changed. Further, the check sum has been executed whenever one data item is received for each entry information category. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The initialization of the entry data has been performed by a method in which the entry item is initialized by using a data clear menu placed on a control panel or another method in which the data is initialized by using a clear key at the time of entering (registering) the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, the foregoing conventional facsimile machine involves a fact that one communication process is insufficient to enter a multiplicity of data items at the time of the data entry operation. Another problem arises in that, if data is simply caused to enter at the time of the data entry process, abnormality of the entry data, if any, cannot be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing conventional process of initializing the entry data to be performed by using the control panel, data change at the time of the remote data entry can be realized by only over-writing of data. Therefore, each entry data is initialized by selecting the clear key at the time of entering the data. As a result, there arises a problem in that the data deletion operation is too complicated to be completed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> illustrates the unit arrangement for executing a remote reading/entering (registering) operation in a facsimile communication system according to a first embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> illustrates the flow of data taken place in the foregoing system. The facsimile communication system according to this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, comprises a personal computer (PC) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> including an RS232C interface serving as a facsimile adapter and another facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> capable of remote-reading the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The remote-reading operation is an operation to be performed by the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to read, via the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, shortened dials caused to enter the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or communication errors or the like. The remote-entering operation is an operation to be performed by the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to cause data about the shortened dial and the like to be caused to enter the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In order to remote-enter the data from the center side into the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at the center displays a data entry menu (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) of a host program. An operator then inputs data in accordance with the entry menu. The operator inputs a connection number with respect to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected to a public circuit network <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by using a data transmission menu (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>) and selects &ldquo;execution&rdquo; included in the menu. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> As a result of the selection of &ldquo;EXECUTION,&rdquo; the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> transmits an entry command and data to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> serving as the communication adapter via the RS232C. The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> serving as the communication adapter calls the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected to the public circuit network <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. When the circuit is connected between the two facsimile machines <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits the entry command in the form of an HDLC frame format (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C) with a 300 bps procedure signal in accordance with a remote entry communication procedure shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that symbols cr and lf are partition characters for the data entry command and the reading command and are expressed by carriage return (0DH) and line feed (0AH) in the ASCII characters. Symbols ff are partition characters denoting that data about the data entry command and that about reading command are continued to the next frame and are expressed by form field (0CH) in the ASCII characters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The remote entry communication procedure is arranged in such a manner that a T.30 initial identification phase is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, defined as the entrance of the remote entry procedure. The remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> declares that it has a remote entry function in NSF (non-standard function). The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> waits for NSS (non-standard function setting), which is the next machine type declaration to be supplied from the center side facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The NSS contains a machine type reading command for the machine type declaration. When the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> receives the foregoing command, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> makes a machine type declaration response by NSC (non-standard command). When the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> receives the NSC, it transmits MCF (message confirmation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> When a response is made with the MCF by the center, the process is shifted to an entry phase or a reading phase as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>. In the foregoing entry phase, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmits the MCF of the data transmission request command and receives the NSS including entry data supplied from the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. If the entry of the entry data has succeeded, it transmits an affirmative response by using a MCF. If the entry has been failed, it transmits a negative response by using an RTN (negative of re-training). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The data entry operation to be performed by the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a flow chart which illustrates the data entry procedure adapted to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the initial identification procedure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is executed in step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then, the entry phase is started. In the entry phase, frames transmitted from the center side facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are, in step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, stored in a frame buffer in the form of the HDLC format excluding flags, the center side facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> being a facsimile machine which performs the remote entry operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> In next step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, only frame entry data items are accumulated in a data receiving buffer (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). If a discrimination is made in step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that an identifier (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A, 8B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C) of the frame final data is two-byte data (cr&equals;0DH, lf&equals;0HA) denoting the completion of the data, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. If a discrimination is made in step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that the identifier is one-byte data (ff&equals;0CH) (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference>) denoting that data continued to continuation frame is present, the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to receive the next data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> If the final frame has been received, the command in the buffer memory is analyzed in step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. If the command is the data entry command (step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>), it is stored in a memory area for entry data corresponding to the entry item (step S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). In step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, check sum (calculations for summing the data in the memory region for each entry item to confirm the entry) is performed, the contents of the check sum being also stored. The data about the check sum is used at the time of checking the memory when power is supplied to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> If the data entry has succeeded., an affirmative response is transmitted in step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. If the entry has been failed, a negative response is transmitted in step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and transmission of the next data is waited for. Finally, a completion signal is received from the center side facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (if an affirmative discrimination is made in step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), the remote entry communication is completed. It should be noted that step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is a data reading phase shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The check sum to be performed in step S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be performed in such a manner that </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> (1) the calculations of summing the byte data in the respective addresses in only the memory region for the entry item are performed; or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> (2) the respective address data items in all entry memory regions are summed as well as the entry data area; or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The results are, as the check sum, written on the check sum data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The check sum for each storage area (a user data region and a TEL data region) for the entry data is calculated. Further, the sum of all binary data items in the foregoing regions is obtained. For example, first data 00H (H denotes hexadecimal notation) to FFH in the user data region are, for example, calculated as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>00<highlight><italic>H&plus;FFH&plus;</italic></highlight>00<highlight><italic>H&plus;FFH&plus;</italic></highlight>33<highlight><italic>H&plus; . . . &plus;</italic></highlight>34<highlight><italic>H&plus;FFH&plus;FFH&plus;FFH&plus;FFH&plus;FFH&equals;SUM</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Then, the results are stored in the user data (a) in the check sum data entry area. Although digit overflow takes place if the sum is obtained by 2-byte data because the check sum is caused to enter by an unsigned in type, the calculation is performed in this embodiment regardless of the overflow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> When power is supplied to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, similar check sum calculations are performed to be subjected to a comparison with the stored check sum data. Since breakage of the data is expected if the check sum data items are different from each other, the entry memory must be initialized so that the erroneous operation of the system is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> As described above, the remote data entry according to this embodiment enables a plurality of entry items and a plurality of data items to be allowed to collectively enter by one communication. By performing the check sum calculations simultaneously with the data entry, data abnormality, if any, causing the contents of the entry data to be changed can easily be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Since data items are collectively stored in the receiving buffer, a large quantity of data can be allowed to remote enter so far as the buffer capacity permits. By calculating the check sum of all entry memory regions after all remote data items have been caused to enter, the needed memory capacity of the check sum program code can be reduced. In addition, the fact that the check sum calculations are collectively executed finally, the data entry time can be shortened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Since the response for transmitting the success and fail of the data entry is transmitted, the operation of the facsimile machine can also be monitored by the center side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> A modification of the foregoing embodiment will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a flow chart of the operation of a modification of the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the first embodiment. In this modification, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits data in the form in which only one command is present in one frame. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the initial identification procedure is executed in step S<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> similarly to the foregoing embodiment. In step S<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the procedure signal received via the circuit, is recorded into the buffer memory. In step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, recording to the entry memory is performed, and calculations and storage of the check sum are performed in step S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In ensuing steps S<highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, response about the fact that data entry could be executed (success of the entry) or the entry could not be performed (fail of the entry) is transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Finally, a completion signal is received from the center. If an affirmative discrimination has been made in step S<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the remote entry communication process is completed here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Since this modification enables the remote data entry operation to be completed in one frame transmission, the data quantity can be reduced. Therefore, the system can be formed by limiting data to the entry items that can be caused to enter at one frame receipt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Also this modification executes the remote entry of the facsimile data, the side (the center) for executing the remote entry selects the entry menu (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) of the host program on the personal computer (PC) and inputs the data in accordance with the entry menu. Then, the data transmission menu (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>) is used to input the connection number with respect to the facsimile machine connected to the public circuit, and then &ldquo;EXECUTION&rdquo; in the menu is selected. As a result, the PC transmits the entry command and the data (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits the connection number to the public circuit to enable the communication with the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to be performed. Further, the remote entry communication procedure shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is used to transmit the entry command in response to the 300 bps procedure signal in the form of the HDLC frame format (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C) in such a manner that limitation to one entry data for one frame is made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to this modification, the program memory can be reduced because the program data working region is not used though a large quantity of entry data cannot be processed within one entry operation. Further, the communication can be completed quickly because the time needed to analyze the data as is needed in step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> can be shortened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> A second modification of the facsimile communication system according to the present invention will now be described. This modification is arranged in such a manner that all frames transmitted to a large-capacity image buffer within one communication are temporarily stored until all frames are received and then the data entry operation is commenced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> illustrate the remote entry communication procedure according to this modification. In this modification, the machine type declaration phase in the remote entry is defined to be the entry of the remote entry procedure. The center, in this phase, confirms the remote entry function and the machine type of the facsimile machine (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). The center then performs the training shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and transmits the VFR, and then the center side facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits the entry command and the data (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) in the HDLC format in place of the image data. A data capacity of 64K bytes can be, in this case, transmitted in one transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> When the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has received the data, it checks the transmission error of each received frame by using the FCS (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C) of the HDLC frame. If a transmission error has been committed, it transmits retransfer signal PPR to the center side facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to receive again the frame. If all frames have been normally received, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> commences the entry operation. However, a fact that the entry process is being performed is, by transmitting the RNR, informed to the center side facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> because no response is made until the entry operation is completed. As a result, the center side facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits the PR and waits for the completion of the entry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> After the entry process has been, completed, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmits the MCF and waits for the next signal. If the next data is present, the center side facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits the DCN and the communication is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a flow chart which illustrates the operation of the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the second modification of the foregoing embodiment. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the initial identification procedure is performed in step S<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and the entry data received as 9600 bps image data is, in step S<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, stored in the image buffer shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. After the final frame has been received (an affirmative discrimination is made in step S<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>), the command in the image buffer is analyzed to record it in the entry data memory corresponding to the entry item (steps S<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>). It should be noted that the RNR is transmitted to the center during the entry operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> After the entry has been completed in step S<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, the check sum calculation is performed in step S<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to also store the contents of the check sum into the memory. In next steps S<highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, an affirmative response is transmitted if the entry has succeeded. If the entry has failed, a negative response is transmitted. Then, the transmission of the next data is waited for. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Finally, the completion signal DCN is received from the center side facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the remote entry communication is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> As described above, this modification enables a plurality of entry items and a plurality of data items to be allowed to enter collectively within one communication. Further, the contents of the remote command can arbitrarily determined. Therefore, a complicated entry operation, that cannot be usually manually completed, can be completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</cross-reference> are flow charts which illustrate the operation of the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the third modification. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</cross-reference>, the initial identification procedure is executed in step S<highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the HDLC signal received by way of the circuit is stored into the frame buffer. If a discrimination has been made in step S<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> that the entry execution command is present in the final data of the frame, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in which a data continuation flag in the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on before the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. If a discrimination has been made in step S<highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> that no command is present, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in which recording of the entry data to the receiving buffer is performed at the time remote entry process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, a discrimination is made whether or not the final frame has been received. If an affirmative discrimination has been made, the data continuation flag in the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned off in step S<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In next steps S<highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, the analysis of the command in the buffer and recording to the entry memory are performed. In step S<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, a discrimination is made whether or not the data continuation flag has been turned on. If the flag has been turned off, the check sum is calculated and stored (step S<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> In steps S<highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, a response is transmitted denoting whether or not the data entry has been completed successfully or failed. If the completion signal has been received in step S<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the foregoing process is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The entry execution command is an identifier, for example, 00H which is a 1-byte data continuation identifier (ff&equals;0CH). In the remote data entry, only character columns and digit columns are allowed to enter while omitting handling of the binary data to prevent erroneous identification between the identifier and the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The data continuation flag is used to judge at the time of interruption data receipt without a command at the time of the data entry. If the foregoing flag has been turned on, a fact is shown that additional data is present in the previously entry item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> As described above, this modification enables the limitation of the quantity of the entry data to be omitted if the capacity of the receiving buffer is too small. For example, remote entry to a facsimile machine, such as a personal facsimile machine, that has a small memory capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> A remote reading operation of a facsimile communication system according to this embodiment will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> The remote reading operation according to this embodiment is arranged in such a manner that the data receiving menu (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>) on the image screen of the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the remote center is first used so that reading items, such as user data, one touch/shortened dials and service data, are selected, the connection No. is inputted to the remote facsimile machine and the execution menu is selected. Then, the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> transmits the remote reading command to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The foregoing reading remote command is a command for instruction the contents of the data to be read from the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the reading remote command being arranged in this embodiment to define the data item to be read with the ASCII character array each composed of two characters as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. For example, the user data is defined to UD, the service data is defined to be SD, and the one touch/shortened dial entry data is defined to be DD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a chart which illustrates the flow of data in the PC at the time of receiving remote reading data according to this embodiment. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> transmits the reading command to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. When the remote reading communication has been completed, the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> receives data in the same format as that of the remote entry command as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> from the remote facsimile mahine by way of the RS-232C interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> The remote reading communication procedure according to this embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Similarly to the remote entry communication procedure according to the foregoing first embodiment, the 300 bps procedure signal is used in this embodiment. The remote reading operation procedure according to this embodiment is performed in accordance with the foregoing communication procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> When the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has received the data transfer command (NSF) from the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, it transmits the remote reading command shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> by using the NSS. When the NSC has been used so that the reading data in accordance with the contents of the remote reading command has been transmitted from the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> responds the reading data and waits for the next reading data. When the final data has been received, the NSF of the data transfer command is transmitted from the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a circuit disconnection command (DCN) is transmitted from the remote reading facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to complete the communication process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> is a flow chart which illustrates the procedure of the remote reading operation according to this embodiment. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the initial identification procedure is executed in step S<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. In next step S<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, the data received by the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is temporarily stored in the frame buffer in the form of the HDLC frame according to the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, the reading command in the HDLC frame is accumulated in the data receiving buffer (RMD buffer) in the memory shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. After the reading commands have been accumulated, the command of the data receiving buffer is analyzed in steps S<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, the reading data corresponding to the foregoing command is accumulated in the data transmitting buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> After all reading data items have been written on the data transmitting buffer, the transmission of the reading data is commenced. The data transmission is repeated until no data is present (steps S<highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>). If the data accumulation is failed or no transmission data is present any more, the NSF (data request command) is transmitted to wait for the transmission of the next data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> When the completion signal (DCN) has been finally received from the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the remote reading operation is completed (step S<highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> As described above, the embodiment enables a plurality of reading items and a plurality of data items to be collectively read in one communication. Further, the data items can collectively be accumulated in the transmitting buffer. Therefore, a large quantity of data can be remote-read so far as the capacity of the buffer permits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> The remote reading process and the remote entry process can be performed alternately to be completed in one communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Then, modifications of this embodiment will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is a flow chart which illustrates the operation of the facsimile communication system according to a first modification of the second embodiment. FIGS. <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are views which illustrate the remote reading communication procedure according to this modification. In this modification, high speed procedures adapted to 9600 bps and 4800 bps are employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The entrance of the remote reading communication procedure of the system according to this modification is the low-speed procedure of the remote communication, that is, the function of the facsimile machine about remote reading and the machine type declaration phase for confirming the function as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Then, training (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>) is performed to determine the communication rate of the facsimile machine before the flow is shifted to the data reading phase (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>) or the data entry phase (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>). In this data reading phase, the data reading command is, in the HDLC frame format (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C), received from the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> checks the transmission error of each of the received frames by the FCS (Frame Check Sequence) of the HDLC frame after it has received the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> If the frame includes a transmission error, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmits the re-transfer request signal PPR and again receives the frame. If all frames have been normally received, the reading data transmission operation is commenced. Since the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> does not respond until the reading operation is completed, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> notifies the fact that it is performing the reading process upon receipt of the RNR to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmits the RR and waits for the completion of the reading operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> After the reading process has been completed, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits the normal reading response (MCF). Therefore, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmits the data transfer request signal (NSF) and waits for the transmission of the next command. When the circuit disconnection command (DCN) has been transmitted from the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the communication process is completed here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Referring to the flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the operation of the facsimile communication system according to this modification will now be described. In step S<highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, the initial identification procedure is executed. In step S<highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, the foregoing training is performed. In step S<highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, the received image data in the form of the HDLC format is accumulated in the image buffer. When the final frame has been received, the transmission error in the image data is checked (step S<highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>) and the accumulation of the image data is repeated until all data is normally received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> If a discrimination has been made in step S<highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> that the image data includes an error, the data retransfer is requested in step S<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> In steps S<highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>, the remote reading command received as the image data is analyzed to accumulate the reading data to be transmitted to the remote reading center is accumulated in another image buffer which is different from the image buffer to be used in the storage operation to be performed in step S<highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>. When all data items have been accumulated, the data transmission is performed (steps S<highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> When the transmission of the reading data has been completed, the completion of the operation of the center is waited for. If the response (MCF) from the center has been received, the transfer request command (NSF) is transmitted (steps S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). The center transmits the DCN if no next data transmission is made. Thus, the remote reading operation of the facsimile machine is completed (step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is a flow chart which illustrates the operation of the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to the second modification of the second embodiment. According to the flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, the initial identification procedure is executed in step S<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> similarly to the system according to the second embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. In next step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, data received by the facsimile machine is temporarily accumulated in the frame buffer in the form of the HDLC frame format according to the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, the reading command in the HDLC frame is stored in the data receiving buffer (the RMD buffer) in the memory having a similar structure as that of the internal memory of the facsimile machine according to the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. After the reading commands have been accumulated, the command of the data receiving buffer is analyzed (steps S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>). In step S<highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, the reading data corresponding to the foregoing command is stored in the data transmitting buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> After all reading data items have been written on the data transmitting buffer, the transmission of the reading data is commenced (step S<highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>). If the capacity of the buffer for transmitting the reading data is too small to store the transmission data into the transmitting buffer, the data transmission is performed during the data storage operation. In step S<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the contents of the transmitting buffer is cleared and to commence the next data accumulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> When the completion signal (DCN) has been finally received from the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the remote reading operation is completed (step S<highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Since this modification is so arranged that the data transmission is performed simultaneously with the data storage process if the capacity of the remote reading data buffer is too small. Therefore, a large quantity of the reading data can be transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Third Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> A third embodiment of the present invention will now be described. Since the structure of the facsimile communication system according to this embodiment is made to be the same as the system according to the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, the illustration of the system is omitted here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the facsimile machine is initialized at the time of the remote en-try process, the data entry menu is selected on the center side personal computer (PC) <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Further, data initialization (clear) is selected on the input image plane of each entry data to execute the data transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is a view which illustrates an example of the entry menu of the one touch/shortened dial. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> illustrates the menu for clearing the memory, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> illustrates a data transmission menu. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> When the entry data is cleared on the menu shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, the number of the one touch/shortened dial is selected. Further, the entry data read by the remote terminal is displayed on the entry menu so that the change entry of the data are enabled. In addition, the cursor is shifted to the item for clearing the data and a clear key (F5) is depressed so that the entry data is deleted from the image plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> After the change entry operation has been completed, a data transmission menu shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> is selected to transmit the changed data. Then, the PC makes a command file about the clear data and the changed data in response to a command similar to the remote entry command according to the second embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. The partition characters for each data are determined to be a carriage return (cr: 0DH) and a line field (lf: 0AH). The command file is made when the transmission is executed with the data transmission menu and transmitted to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by way of the RS-232C interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> The form of the clear data in the command file is categorized into the following two types: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> (1) In order to perform the data initialization operation by writing the clear data with the initial value, the data entry command and the initial value data are transmitted from the PC to the center side facsimile machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> (2) If no data about clear of the telephone number, and the abbreviated name is present, the initial value of the data is not present. Therefore, a command, to which no data is added, is processed as a data clear command so that the data is cleared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> The following command files are present for clearing the data:

<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, the type of the facsimile machine, which is the remote terminal, and whether or not it has the remote entry function (RMD bit) are confirmed by the NSF (non-standard function) in step S<highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>. If the remote entry function bit is present in the NSF in step S<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, CSI is stored and a parameter is set by the DIS in step S<highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>. In next step S<highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, NSS/TSI/DCS are transmitted to commence the machine type confirmation process in the remote entry operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> If no RMD bit is present in the NSF in step S<highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, the DCN (the disconnection command) is transmitted in step S<highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> so that the communication process is forcible completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> If the response receipt is made in step S<highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and if the NSC (the non-standard function command), which is the response to the NSS (non-standard function setting), is received in step S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference>, the remote entry function bit of the NSC is confirmed in next step S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the result of the confirmation, data about the machine type, destination and the ROM version and the like included in the NSC data field is, in step S<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, stored in the file in the center facsimile machine. The center facsimile machine transmits the MCF (message confirmation) in step S<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> When the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> receives the NSS, it analyzes the command and data in the NSS. If the command and the data are correct data (if an affirmative discrimination is made in step S<highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>), a discrimination is made in step S<highlight><bold>337</bold></highlight> that the received command is the RMD data reading command or the entry request command. If the command is the reading command, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> in which the reading process (to be described later) is performed. If the command is the entry request command, the MCF is transmitted in step S<highlight><bold>339</bold></highlight>, and the command receipt is discriminated in step S<highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</cross-reference> is a detailed flow chart of the reading process.

<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> If the response cannot be confirmed in step S<highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight>, the processes in steps S<highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> are repeated three times (the number of times is counted in step S<highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>). If no response is made within the times, the flow proceeds to in step S<highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> in which the DCN is transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> Then, the entry processing procedure according to this embodiment will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37A and 37B</cross-reference> are flow charts which illustrate the entry procedure of the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37A and 37B</cross-reference>, when the circuit has been established with the remote center side facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the initial identification procedure is executed in step S<highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. In next step S<highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the transmitted NSS signal is stored in the frame buffer, and the entry data in the NSS is stored in the remote entry data buffer in step S<highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, a discrimination is made whether or not the data is the final data, and then the data analysis process is commenced in step S<highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, a discrimination is made whether or not the data entry is made. The analysis of the stored data is performed in such a manner that the data entry item is determined in accordance with the entry command and the entry data is recorded in the item. In step S<highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, branching is realized depending upon whether or not data is accompanying with the command. It should be noted that the initialization process is also performed at the time of the command analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> If the data accompanying with the transmitted command is the previous initialize data, that is, if an affirmative discrimination is made in step S<highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, the initialization is performed in the data entry process in step S<highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>. If no data is accompanying with the transmitted command, the data is deleted as the initialization process in step S<highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. For example, if the data is the destine number of the one touch/shortened dial, the entry of the one touch/shortened dial number is deleted. The abbreviated destination name or the like is processed in such a manner that the entry contents are cleared. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> The foregoing process is continued until the data transmission from the center side facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is completed. In step S<highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>, a discrimination is made whether or not the entry process has been completed normally. If the entry process has been completed normally, the MCF of the affirmative response is transmitted in step S<highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> and the next command is waited for. If the entry process has been failed, the RTN which is the negative response is transmitted in step S<highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and next command is waited for. If the receipt of the completion signal has been confirmed in next step S<highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, that is, if the DCN denoting the completion of transmission of the command file has been transmitted from the center side facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the remote entry process is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> As described above, this embodiment enable the process for initializing each item of the facsimile machine to be performed in a remote manner by the remote data initialization. Therefore, the entry data and various software switches can be initialized while omitting the necessity for the service person to visit the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> Further, the remote initialization can be executed simultaneously with the remote entry. Therefore, if the initialization process accompanies the process for changing the entry data, it can be completed in a remote manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> The contents to be cleared in the remote initialization may be performed in the overall memory region relating to a certain entry item. In order to achieve this, the PC menu shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> is used to simultaneously execute the input of the connection N and the data transmission. In order to perform a partial initialization of the memory region, a remote command shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> The initialization may be performed by using the entry process procedure according to the third embodiment. In the data entry process in step S<highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>, when the command shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</cross-reference> is received, the memory defined by the command is cleared. The foregoing clear process is performed in such a manner that the user data or the one touch shortened dial are cleared by deleting all entered data items. The service software switches and the user software switches are processed in such a manner that the entry data is set to the initial value (default). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> The foregoing method is effective in a case where all data items are cleared in the data initialization operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be applied to a system composed of a plurality of units or a sole apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> As described above, reading of remote data and entry are performed simultaneously so that the entry data is initialized in a remote manner at the time of the remote data entry or the entry confirmation data is generated. As a result, if the entry data is crushed, the abnormality can be detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> Further, the maintenance and service of the apparatus can easily be performed by displaying the entry data on the center facsimile machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> Fourth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment has a DRAM for storing a large-size data file such as image data, the DRAM having a region for use a working region and as a transmitting/receiving buffer and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> &lt;Data Entry Process (Data Registry Process)&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> At the time of the data entry, the user first inputs the entry data to the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by using the host program on the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in accordance with a menu shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>. The PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> transmits, together with command to serve as the entry command, the supplied data to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by way of the RS232C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> The flow of the operation of the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> serving as a communication adapter to be performed at the time of receiving the entry data is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</cross-reference>. The data entry command can be said that it is a variation of the file write command. When the command is received, a file is made from the supplied data in accordance with the file write command process in step S<highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is operated as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference> when the entry data has been transmitted from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The foregoing process is the same as the process to be performed when the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has received the file write command from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> Making of Entry Data File (Registry Data File) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> First a management record of a file to be made is obtained onto an image management table to obtain a file region from the DRAM. The management record corresponds to the image file and the entry data file and the like as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>. When a region has been obtained on the DRAM, ACK is sent out. If no region has been obtained, NACK is sent out (steps S<highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>). When the management record of the entry data file is made, the file is given the file number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> Then, data supplied from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> obtained by way of the interface RS232C is sequentially stored in an exclusive buffer. At this time, the data must be composed of an ASCII code and a control code, the data start must be &ldquo;DT&equals;&rdquo; and the end of the data must be Q&equals;eop. Therefore, when the data is received (step S<highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>), whether or not the start of the data is &ldquo;DT&equals;&rdquo; is checked (step S<highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>). If an affirmative result is obtained, the data receipt is continued (step S<highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>). While storing the received data into the buffer, the data is analyzed in a non-synchronous manner. The data is, in one line units (receipt of &ldquo;crlf&rdquo; denotes the completion of one line), transferred from the buffer to an image area on the DRAM. The process for each one line is repeated until the data transfer is completed. Thus, the data file is closed. That is, when &ldquo;crlf&rdquo; is received (step S<highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>), a discrimination is made that one line is completed, causing data for one line is written into the file formed in the DRAM (step S<highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> The transmitting buffer according to this embodiment means an RMD transmission file shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference>. The foregoing file is the same as the RMD entry data file and serves as a region for storing data supplied from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and also serves as a region for the entry data to be transmitted to the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The receiving buffer is the RMD receipt file shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 46</cross-reference>. The foregoing file is the same as an RMD log file, the file being a region for storing the signal received from the remote facsimile machine and the transmission signal of the communication adapter and also a region for recording the log. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> The entry data file is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>, made in the same file as that for the image file to be made at the time of the image communication operation to be performed by the facsimile machine. Therefore, the entry data and the image data can be handled similarly, and an image can be written into an image area of the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by a similar method for the entry data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> While processing the data, Q given to the trailing portion of the data is tested. If the result is &ldquo;EOP&rdquo;, a discrimination is made that the procedure is completed, and the file is closed (step S<highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> When making of the entry data file in step S<highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> has been completed as described above, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> in which the log file is made in the image area on the DRAM. The procedure for making the log file is shown in a flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> The log file is opened such that the file number of the latest image file (the term &ldquo;image file&rdquo; is the name including the entry data and the log file) is examined (steps S<highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>), and then the file number is given to correspond to the result of the examination (step S<highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight>). Then, the management record of the log file is, similarly to the entry data file, obtained on to the image management table. In order to obtain it, examinations are performed whether or not the management record region can be obtained on the image management table and whether or not the file region can be obtained on the DRAM (step S<highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>). If they can be obtained, a management record is made (step S<highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>) so that the log file can be opened in the image file region (step S<highlight><bold>807</bold></highlight>). The management record can be managed with the file number (corresponding to the file) which is the member. The file number is increased by one from the previous file number at the time of obtaining the image management record on to the image management table. Assuming that the file number of the entry data file is <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and the file number of the log file is <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> When the entry data file and the log file have been opened as described above, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> calls the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the public circuit network in step S<highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. If the circuit has been connected, the entry data form is converted into a transmission signal in the 300 bps HDLC frame format shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C in accordance with a remote entry communication procedure and it is transmitted in step S<highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. The remote entry communication procedure has the introduction thereof which is the T.30 initial identification phase shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. That is, the message change shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is performed in step S<highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. In this phase, the rate of the ensuing communication is set to a high speed procedure of 9600 bps or 4800 bps. The remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which has received the entry data declares that it has the remote entry function in the NSF (Non-Standard Function). The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which has received the declaration, issues a machine type request command, which is the machine type reading command, to the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and waits for the machine type declaration response. The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> then waits for the machine type declaration response. The machine type request command is issued in the NSS (Non-Standard Function). When the NSC (Non-Standard Function) of the machine declaration response has been received, the MCF (Message Confirmation) denoting the completion of the machine type declaration is transmitted. When the machine type declaration phase has been completed, the remote entry procedure is shifted to the data entry phase shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> In the data entry phase, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> receives the NSF, which is the data transfer request command supplied from the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to transmit the NSS which is the entry command and the entry data. The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> waits for the entry response from the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> after it has transmitted the NSS. The NSS is in the form realized by converting the entry data into the HDLC frame format, and FIF (information field) of the NSS is the contents of the entry data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> The response with respect to the NSS and supplied from the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is categorized into an affirmative response and a negative response which respectively are MCF and RTN (training negation). When the communication adapter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has received the MCF, it transmits the NSS of the next command if the next command is present. If no next command is present, it transmits the DCN (disconnection command). If the communication adapter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has received the RTN, it transmits the DCN and completes the process or transmits a next command. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> The process for executing the foregoing procedure is performed in steps from step S<highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> in such a manner that the command is received in step S<highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. Then, the transmitted contents and the received contents are stored into the receiving buffer, that is, the log file in steps S<highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>. At this time, transmission identifier &ldquo;TX&rdquo; is added to the received contents and receipt identifier &ldquo;RX&rdquo; is added to the received contents as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50 and 51</cross-reference> before the contents are written. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> The processes to be performed in steps S<highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> are shown in a flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> First, the log file is opened (step S<highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight>), and an examination is performed that the signal is transmitted or received (step S<highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>). In accordance with the result of the examination, data is written on the log file. If the transmission is made, the contents of the entry data file are read out (step S<highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>) and the identifier &ldquo;TX&rdquo; is added (step S<highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>). If the signal is received, that is, if a signal is received from the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the received signal is read (step S<highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight>) and the identifier &ldquo;RX&rdquo; is added (step S<highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>). Then, data is written on to the log file (step S<highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight>). When the transmission contents are written to the log file, an operation of transferring the data from the entry data, which is the transmitting buffer, to the receiving buffer is performed and an access to the two buffers is made. When the transmission has been completed, that is, when the remote data entry has been completed, the log file is closed (step S<highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> The identifiers &ldquo;TX&rdquo; and &ldquo;RX&rdquo; are effectively used when the log file is transmitted to the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in accordance with the entry confirmation command issued from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and a confirmation is made whether or not it has been allowed to enter normally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> When the transmission and receipt contents have been recorded into the log, an examination is made in step S<highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> whether or not the MCF has been received. If it has not been received, the DCN is transmitted to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the transmission of the entry data is completed. If the MCF has been received, an examination is made in step S<highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> whether or not the command to be transmitted is present. If the command is present, the process of transmitting the entry command in step S<highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is repeated.

The result request command is a command for requesting the transmission of the log file. The command requires the file number to be instructed from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> reads out the file number of the entry data file with the status command at the time of making the previous entry data file (in step S<highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>). Since the file number of the log file is a value obtained by adding one to the file number of the data file as described above, the number of the log file can be obtained by adding one to the file number of the entry data file which has been read out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> The file reading procedure is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A and 43B</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</cross-reference> illustrates the message transmission/receipt, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43B</cross-reference> illustrates the format of the file read command <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> A fifth embodiment will now be described in which entry data allowed to enter the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is read out. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference> illustrates the procedure of the process to be performed by the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which has received the entry data reading command from the PC. The foregoing procedure is substantially the same as the process for setting the entry data described in the fourth embodiment except for the different between the command and the response and a slight difference in the process. Therefore, the common process to the fourth embodiment is described briefly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> The PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> inputs the entry data items to be read from the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in accordance with the host program on the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>) and transmits data to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by way of the interface RS232C (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>D and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> sequentially stores the data transmitted from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into the exclusive buffer to write the data for each line into the entry data file. When the data transmission has been completed, the entry data file is closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> Then, the log file is generated. Assuming that the entry data file number is <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the log file number of the file is <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> The communication adapter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> calls the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the public circuit network. When the circuit has been connected, the communication adapter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmits the entry data in accordance with the remote entry communication procedure while converting it into the 300 bps HDLC frame format (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C). The remote entry communication procedure has the introduction thereof which is the T.30 initial identification phase (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The remote facsimile machine which has received the data declares that it has the remote entry function in the NSF (Non-Standard Function). The communication adapter which has received the declaration issues the machine type request command, which is the command to read the machine type, to the remote facsimile machine and waits for the machine type declaration response. The machine type request command is issued in the NSS (Non-Standard Setting). When the NSC (Non-Standard Function Command) of the machine type declaration response is received, the MCF denoting the completion of the machine type declaration is transmitted. When the machine type declaration phase has been completed, the remote entry procedure proceeds to the data reading phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> The foregoing operations are performed in steps S<highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</cross-reference>. The data reading phase is performed in accordance with the procedure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the data reading phase is performed in such a manner that the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> receives the NSF, which is the data transfer request command issued by the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and transmits the NSS which is the reading command to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. After the NSS has been transmitted, the entry response from the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is waited for. The NSS is obtained by converting the reading data into the HDLC frame format. The response from the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is made in the form of the reading data, which is the NSC. The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> makes a response to the NSC, the response being categorized into an affirmative response and a negative response each of which is composed of the MCF (message confirmation) and the RTN (training negation). After the response has been transmitted, the NSF which is the data transfer command of the remote facsimile machine is waited for. After the NSF has been received, the NSS is transmitted if the reading data item is present. If the item is not present, the DCN is transmitted, and the process is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> The process for executing the foregoing procedure is performed in the step from step S<highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight>, the reading command is transmitted, and the contents to be transmitted and received are stored in the receiving buffer, that is, the log file in steps S<highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight>. At this time, the transmission identifier &ldquo;TX&rdquo; is added to the contents to be transmitted as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 50 and 51</cross-reference>, while the receipt identifier &ldquo;RX&rdquo; is added to the contents to be received.

<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates the procedure of the process to be performed when the entry command has been sent from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> The PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> supplies data to be caused to enter the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by the host program on the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>) and transmits the data to the facsimile machine 1 by way of the interface RS232C (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>D and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 44</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> sequentially stores the data sent from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into the exclusive buffer and writes the data for each line on the data file. When the data has been transferred, the data file is closed. The data file is generated on the image area on the DRAM for the image file to be generated at the time of the image transfer performed by a usual facsimile machine (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> The image file is managed by means of the file number and also the file number is given to the entry data file. The transmitting buffer according to this embodiment means the RMD transmitting buffer shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference> which is a region for storing the reading data of the contents of the generated data file, that is, the entry data to be transmitted to the remote facsimile machine. By possessing the buffer, the formation of the transmission data at the time of the retransfer and data writing on to the log file can efficiently be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> calls the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the public circuit network. The machine type declaration phase of the remote entry is defined as the entrance of the remote entry procedure. In this state, a high speed procedure at 9600 bps and 4800 bps is employed to perform the communication. The procedure of the machine type declaration phase is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> The remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which has received the data declares that it has the remote entry function in the NSF (Non-Standard Function Declaration). The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which has received the declaration issue, to the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the machine type request command which is the command to read the machine type and waits for the machine type declaration response. The machine type request command is issued in the NSS (Non-Standard Function Declaration). When the NSC (Non-Standard Function Command) of the machine type declaration response has been received, the MCF denoting the completion of the machine type declaration is transmitted. When the machine type declaration phase has been completed, training is performed and the CFR (receipt preparation confirmation) is transmitted. Then, the entry command and data are, in the form of the HDLC format, are transmitted similarly to the transmission of the image data. In this case, a data capacity of 64 Kbyte can be transmitted in one transmission operation. When the communication adapter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has received the entry command, it writes the command on the log file. The foregoing procedure is the same as that according to the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> The foregoing processes are performed in steps S<highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> The remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which has received the entry data checks transmission error in the received data. If the transmission data is present, the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmits the PPR (retransfer request signal) to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> waits for the response of the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to test it (step S<highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight>). If the PPR has been received, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> retransfers the frame denoted by the PPR (step S<highlight><bold>1209</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> If the result of the check of the error in the receive data is normal, the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> commences the entry operation such that it transmits the RNR until the entry operation is completed. When the entry has been completed, it transmits the MCF. Therefore, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made standby until it receives the MCF while transmitting the RR with respect to the received RNR (step S<highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> When the response is received from the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, it is written on the log file (step S<highlight><bold>1211</bold></highlight>). The procedure in this case is the same as that according to the fourth embodiment. Then, whether or not the received response is the MCF is tested (step S<highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight>). If the MCF has been received, whether or not next data is present is examined (step S<highlight><bold>1213</bold></highlight>). If the data is present, the next data is transmitted. If the next data is not present, the DCN is transmitted and the communication is completed (step S<highlight><bold>1214</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> The procedure from step S<highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>1214</bold></highlight> is made similarly to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. By employing the procedure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</cross-reference>, only the command received correctly is recorded on the log while preventing recording of the command transferred again due to the transmission error. Therefore, the size of the log file can be made adequately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> The thus-made log file can be read out from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. That is, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is operated in such a manner that the communication adapter transmits the contents of the log file to meet the result request command (file read) issued from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by way of the interface RS232C (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40, 43A</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> The PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> receives the reading data items onto the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from a user by using the host program on the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference>) and transmits the data to the communication adapter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via the interface RS232C (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>D and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> sequentially stores the data transferred from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> into the exclusive buffer to write data for each line on to the entry data file. When the data transfer has been completed, the entry data file is closed. The entry data file is generated on a similar image area to the image file to be generated at the time of the usual facsimile operation (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> The image file is managed with the file number and the entry data file is also given the file number The transmitting buffer according to this embodiment means the RMD transmitting buffer shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference> which is the region for storing reading data of the data file generated here, that is, the entry data to be transmitted to the remote facsimile machine. By possessing the foregoing buffer, the formation of the transmission data at the time of the retransfer and data writing on to the log file can efficiently be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> calls the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the public circuit network. The machine type declaration phase of the remote entry is defined as the entry of the remote entry procedure and the high speed procedure of 9600 bps and 4800 bps is employed to perform the communication (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> The remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which has received the data declares that it has the remote entry function in the NSF (Non-Standard Function Declaration). The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which has received the declaration issues, to the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the machine type request command which is a command to read the machine type and waits for the machine type declaration response. The machine type request command is included in the NSS (Non-Standard Function Declaration). When the NSC (Non-Standard Function Command) of the machine type declaration response is received, the MCF denoting the completion of the machine type declaration is transmitted. When the machine type declaration phase has been completed, training is performed and the CFR (Confirmation of the Receipt Preparation) is transmitted. Then, the reading data items are transmitted in the form of the HDLC format similarly to the transmission of the image data. In this case, a data capacity of 64 Kbyte can be transmitted in one transmission operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> The remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which has received the reading data transmits the PPR (Retransfer Request Signal) if the transmission error is present as a result of the transmission error check. The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which has received the PPR retransfers the frame indicated by the PPR. If a normal result is obtained in the error check performed by the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> transmits the contents of the entry data in the HDLC format. The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> receives the data and performs the process of writing the received data on to the receiving buffer. If an item having no reading data response is present, the MCF is transmitted. If all reading data items are normal, the DCN is transmitted and the communication is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> stores the transmission contents and the receipt signal into the receiving buffer while communicating with the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. At this time, the transfer identifier &ldquo;TX&rdquo; is added to the transmission contents and the receipt identifier &ldquo;RX&rdquo; is added to the receipt signal before they are written. When the transmission is completed, that is, the remote data entry is completed, the log file is closed (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> The foregoing procedure is shown in steps S<highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>1313</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference>, when the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has received the NSF/DIS reading command from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, it obtains, on the image management table, a management record of the file to be made in step S<highlight><bold>1610</bold></highlight> and obtains a memory from the DRAM. The image management record of the data file is made and the file number is given to it (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>). The file number is transmitted to the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as status information by way of the interface RS232C with the status command to be supplied from the PC <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The foregoing file is called NSF/DIS hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> In next step S<highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight>, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> calls the destined remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the public circuit network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> In next step S<highlight><bold>1603</bold></highlight>, the parameter of the NSF/DIS command is instructed as &ldquo;CD&equals;11&rdquo; so that the attribute of the file is made to be NSF/DIS of the RMD. Further, file initialization is performed in such a manner that the page forming the present file is deleted and a new page is formed to examine in step S<highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight> whether or not the initialization has succeeded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> The remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (destined facsimile machine) which has been called transmits the NSF (Non-standard Function Declaration), the CSI (Called-Side Identification) and DIS (Digital Identification Signal) indicating the performance of the called side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> The communication adapter which has received the foregoing signals, it tests in step S<highlight><bold>1605</bold></highlight> whether or not the received contents are DIS. If the contents are the DIS, the communication adapter, in step S<highlight><bold>1606</bold></highlight>, writes the contents on the NSF/DIS file which has been made previously. As an example of this, the HDLC frame of the DIS is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</cross-reference>. The contents to be written on the file are the FIF in the frame. The foregoing operations are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference>, the NSF/DIS file is opened (step S<highlight><bold>1701</bold></highlight>). Then, a discrimination is made whether or not the received signal is the DIS (step S<highlight><bold>1702</bold></highlight>). If the signal is the DIS, the frame length, from which the address of the received frame, the control, FCF and FCS fields are omitted, is calculated (step S<highlight><bold>1704</bold></highlight>). If the DIS could not be received, the DCN is transmitted and the communication is completed here (step S<highlight><bold>1703</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> When the file read command is issued from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the communication adapter transmits the contents of the NSF/DIS file. The results are shown in the right half portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</cross-reference>. In accordance with the foregoing results, the entry items, entry data or reading data items can be set into the remote facsimile machine. Further, the facsimile function of the destined machine can be recognized. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0364" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0364&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the description will be made about the procedure in which the logs of the remote entry data reading command are sequentially recorded as is performed in the fifth embodiment together with the process of the NSF/DIS file according to the tenth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0365" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0365&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</cross-reference> illustrates the procedure of the operation to be performed by the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which performs the NSF/DIS file command and the entry data reading command. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0366" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0366&rsqb;</number> The operator inputs the connection number which is the telephone number of the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by using the host program on the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</cross-reference>). When &ldquo;EXECUTION&rdquo; is selected, the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> transmits the NSF/DIS reading command to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by way of the interface RS232C (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</cross-reference>). The NSF/DIS reading command is in a special form of the file write command shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>D arranged such that the file write data code is made to be &ldquo;NSF/DIS&rdquo; and only data Q (EOP) is written on the file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0367" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0367&rsqb;</number> Further, the operator inputs the entry data items to be read from the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in accordance with the menu by using the host program on the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</cross-reference>) and transmits data to the communication adapter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by way of the interface RS232C. The procedure of the foregoing process is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</cross-reference> illustrates the process to be performed by the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the moment at which it receives the command sent from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which has received the two inputs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0369&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</cross-reference>, when the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has received the NSF/DIS reading command issued from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, it opens the NSF/DIS file in step S<highlight><bold>1801</bold></highlight>. That is, the management record of the file to be made is obtained on the image management table and obtains a memory from the DRAM. Further, an image management record of the data file is made while giving the file number (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>). The file number is transmitted as the status information to the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by way of the interface RS232C in accordance with the status command to be issued from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>D). The foregoing file will be called &ldquo;NSF/DIS&rdquo; hereinafter. By instructing the parameter of the reading command to be &ldquo;CD&equals;11&rdquo;, the attribute of the file is made to be NSF/DIS of the RMD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0370&rsqb;</number> When the remote data entry command is issued from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the entry data file is made in step S<highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight>, the entry data file is made and data is written in step S<highlight><bold>1802</bold></highlight>. When the data transfer has been completed, the data file is closed. The foregoing procedure is arranged similarly to the foregoing description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0371" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0371&rsqb;</number> In next step S<highlight><bold>1803</bold></highlight>, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> calls the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in the public circuit network. In next step S<highlight><bold>1804</bold></highlight>, the page which forms the present NSF/DIS file is deleted and a new page is provided so that the file is initialized. In next step S<highlight><bold>1805</bold></highlight>, the results of the initialization are examined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0372" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0372&rsqb;</number> The remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which has been called, transmits the NSF (Non-Standard Function Declaration), the CSI (Called-Side Identification) and DIS (Digital Identification Signal) indicating the performance of the called side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0373" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0373&rsqb;</number> When the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has received the response from the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, it examines in step S<highlight><bold>1806</bold></highlight> whether or not the DIS has been received. If it has been received, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1807</bold></highlight> in which the received contents are written on the NSF/DIS file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0374" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0374&rsqb;</number> After the foregoing writing operation has been completed, the procedure of the machine type declaration phase shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is executed in step S<highlight><bold>1808</bold></highlight>. The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> issues the machine type request command, which is the command to read the machine type, and waits for the machine type declaration response. When the machine type request command NSS (Non-Standard Function Declaration) is issued and the NSC (Non-Standard Function Command) of the machine type declaration response has been received, the MCF denoting the completion of the machine type declaration is transmitted. When the machine type declaration phase has been completed, the remote entry procedure is shifted to the data reading phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0375" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0375&rsqb;</number> The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> stores the contents to be transmitted and the receipt signal into the NSF/DIS file while communicating with the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in steps S<highlight><bold>1809</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>1811</bold></highlight>. At this time, the transmission identifier &ldquo;TX&rdquo; is added to the contents to be transmitted and the receiving identifier &ldquo;RX&rdquo; is added to the receipt signal (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>). The foregoing file is not a log file but it is an NSF/DIS file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0376" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0376&rsqb;</number> In the data reading phase, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> receives the NSF, which is the data transfer request command, from the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and transmits the NSS which is the reading command. The NSS is obtained by converting the reading data into the HDLC frame format. After the NSS has been transmitted, the entry response from the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is waited for. The response from the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is the reading data, that is, the NSC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0377" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0377&rsqb;</number> The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> responds to the NSC, the response being categorized into an affirmative response and a negative response which respectively are the MCF (Message Confirmation) and the RTN (Retraining Negation). After the response has been transmitted, the NSF, which is the data transfer request from the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is waited for. After the NSF has been received, a discrimination is made in step S<highlight><bold>1812</bold></highlight> whether or not the reading item is further present. If the reading item is present, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1814</bold></highlight> in which the MCF is transmitted. If no reading item is present, the DCN is transmitted and the communication is completed in step S<highlight><bold>1813</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0378" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0378&rsqb;</number> As a result of the foregoing procedure, the function of the remote facsimile machine and the remote entry data reading log can be stored in the NSF/DIS file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0379" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0379&rsqb;</number> &lt;Reading of NSF/DIS File&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0380" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0380&rsqb;</number> The PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> request the transmission of the NSF/DIS file via the interface RS232C (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A and 43B</cross-reference>). It is the file read command having the contents which are the same as that according to the foregoing embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0381" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0381&rsqb;</number> That is, when the command from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has been received, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transmits the contents of the NSF/DIS file. As a result, the communication function of the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the contents of the read remote entry data can be known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0382" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0382&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be applied to a system consisting of a plurality of units or a sole apparatus. The present invention may, of course, be applied to a structure in which a program is supplied to a system or an apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0383" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0383&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the hystresis of the data entry performed by the communication can be left. Further, the function of the destined apparatus and the state of the communication can be known from the host computer to which it is connected. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</cross-reference> is a block diagram which illustrates the structure of the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0386" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0386&rsqb;</number> Reference numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> represents a network control apparatus for controlling the public circuit network, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> represents a modem for modulating and demodulating the digital signal and the analog signal and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> represents a CPU for controlling the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> represents a ROM for storing, for example, a program to be executed by the CPU <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> represents a RAM to be used as a working area or which stores remote entry data, such as shortened telephone number list and a calling side name and the like. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> represents an operation panel which is operated by an operator, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> represents a reading apparatus for reading an original document, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> represents a recording apparatus for printing information on to recording paper, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> represents a telephone for performing communication, and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> represents a switch for inhibiting/permitting the entry and reading to and from the RMD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0387" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0387&rsqb;</number> The RAM <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes regions as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</cross-reference>, that is, an RMD data region <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> on which a value corresponding to the state of the RMD switch is written, a write inhibited data region <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> on which a value corresponding to the state of the write inhibition switch is written, a service RMD data region <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> on which the value of the service RMD switch is written, and a service reading permission data region <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on which a value corresponding to the state of the service permission switch is written. Although the foregoing switches may be software switches to be inputted as binary data, mechanical and electrical switches provided for the RMD switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are employed in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0388" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0388&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing structure, the operator executes, for example, the program included in the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to instruct and input data to be remote entry in the remote facsimile machine or data allowed to enter the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the input thus-made, the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> sends supplied data and a command such as data entry about the remote entry or a command to read data to be facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by way of the interface RS323C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0389" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0389&rsqb;</number> The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which has received the foregoing commands, makes a remote entry file in accordance with the supplied data, and transmits data filed in the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in accordance with a predetermined control procedure. The predetermined control procedure according to this embodiment is arranged to be a binary procedure. That is, a phase is performed in which the functions of the destined machines are changed, and then a phase is commenced in which data to be allowed to enter or data to be read is sent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0390" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0390&rsqb;</number> The transmission control procedure between the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in each phase is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0391" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0391&rsqb;</number> In the machine type declaration phase shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> called from the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> declares the machine type in accordance with the flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</cross-reference>. The flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</cross-reference> illustrates the procedure of the process to be performed by the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the declaration moment, that is, that performed by the CPU <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0392" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0392&rsqb;</number> In a standby state, the state of the RMD switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is observed at predetermined interval. If the RMD switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is switched on, &ldquo;1&rdquo; (also called &ldquo;ON&rdquo;) is written on the RMD data <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the RAM <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. If it is switched off, &ldquo;0&rdquo; (also called &ldquo;OFF&rdquo;) is written on the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0393" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0393&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</cross-reference> illustrates a state from the foregoing state. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</cross-reference>, an examination is continued in step S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> that the call is received. If the call is received, the RMD data <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the memory <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is tested in step S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0394" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0394&rsqb;</number> If the RMD data is turned on (1), the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in which the bit denoting that the RMD function is possessed is made to be &ldquo;0&rdquo; and a machine type declaration initial identification is transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0395" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0395&rsqb;</number> Thus, the machine type declaration initial identification is sent to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> discrimination whether or not the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has the RMD function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0396" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0396&rsqb;</number> If the bit denoting that the RMD function is possessed is &ldquo;1&rdquo;, the data entry/request phase is commenced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0397" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0397&rsqb;</number> If the bit denoting that the RMD function is possessed is &ldquo;0&rdquo;, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> sends the DCN (disconnection completion signal) to the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to disconnect the communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0398" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0398&rsqb;</number> As a result of the foregoing procedure, the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is able to prevent the remote data entry from the center by operating the switch as well as its original function. Therefore, undesirable data entry can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0399" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0399&rsqb;</number> Another method may be available that the data entry or rewriting is inhibited in place of notifying that the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has not the remote entry function. If writing is inhibited, the entry data can be read. Therefore, a write inhibition switch provided for the switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is used in addition to the RMD switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0400" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0400&rsqb;</number> The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> observes the states of the RMD switch and the write inhibition switch at predetermined intervals in the standby state. If the switches are switched on, &ldquo;1&rdquo; is written on the RMD data <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the write inhibition data <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the RAM <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. If the switches are switched off, &ldquo;0&rdquo; is written on the same. The flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</cross-reference> illustrates the process to be performed by the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the foregoing moment, that is, the process to be performed by the CPU <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which controls the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0401" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0401&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>2101</bold></highlight>, a call from the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is examined. If call receipt from a telephone circuit or the like has been detected, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2102</bold></highlight> in which the RMD data <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is tested. If the RMD data is turned on (1), the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2103</bold></highlight> in which the write inhibition data <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0402" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0402&rsqb;</number> If the write inhibition data is turned on (1) in step S<highlight><bold>2103</bold></highlight>, the bit of the NSF denoting that the RMD function is possessed shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is made to be &ldquo;1&rdquo; and the write inhibition bit is made to be &ldquo;1&rdquo; to send the machine type declaration initial identification in step S<highlight><bold>2104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0403" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0403&rsqb;</number> If the write inhibition data is turned off (0), the bit of the NSF denoting that the RMD function is possessed shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is made to be &ldquo;1&rdquo; and the write inhibition bit is made to be &ldquo;0&rdquo; to send the machine type declaration initial identification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0404" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0404&rsqb;</number> If the RMD data is turned off (1) in step S<highlight><bold>2102</bold></highlight>, the bit of the NSF denoting that the RMD function is possessed is made to be &ldquo;0&rdquo; to send the machine type declaration initial identification in step S<highlight><bold>2106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0405" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0405&rsqb;</number> As described above, the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is able to inhibit data writing in place of the arrangement that the use of the remote entry function is not allowed the center side. In this state, the center side cannot rewrite the data but is able to know the value of the entry data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0406" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0406&rsqb;</number> In the system according to this embodiment, an arrangement may be employed in which the notification from the center, that is, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, of a fact that the remote entry function is not possessed is not permitted for usual users at the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, but is limited to a portion of service persons who maintain the apparatus. Further, the usual users are inhibited to enter or rewrite data. If writing is inhibited, entry data can be read. Accordingly, the service RMD switch allocated to the switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is used in place of the foregoing RMD switch. Since use of the foregoing switch is inhibited for the usual user, it must be displaced, for example, in portion of the apparatus that cannot be usually operated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0407" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0407&rsqb;</number> The facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> looks the states of the RMD switch and the write inhibition switch at predetermined intervals. If the switches are switched on, &ldquo;1&rdquo; is written on the RMD data <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the write inhibition data <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the RAM <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. If the switches are switched off, &ldquo;0&rdquo; is written on the same. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</cross-reference> is a flow chart which illustrates the procedure of the operations to be performed by the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, that is, the CPU <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which controls the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from the foregoing moment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0408" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0408&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>2201</bold></highlight>, a call from the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is examined. If a call from a telephone circuit or the like is detected, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2202</bold></highlight> in which the service RMD data <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is tested. If the service RMD data is turned on (1), the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2203</bold></highlight> in which the write inhibition data <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0409" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0409&rsqb;</number> If the write inhibition data is turned on (1) in step S<highlight><bold>2203</bold></highlight>, the bit of the NSF denoting that the RMD function is possessed shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is made to be &ldquo;1&rdquo; and the write inhibition bit is made to be &ldquo;1&rdquo; to send the machine type declaration initial identification in step S<highlight><bold>2204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0410" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0410&rsqb;</number> If the write inhibition data is turned off (0), the bit of the NSF denoting that the RMD function is possessed shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is made to be &ldquo;1&rdquo; and the write inhibition bit is made to be &ldquo;0&rdquo; to send the machine type declaration initial identification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0411" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0411&rsqb;</number> If the service RMD data is turned off (1) in step S<highlight><bold>2202</bold></highlight>, the bit of the NSF denoting that the RMD function is possessed is made to be &ldquo;0&rdquo; to send the machine type declaration initial identification in step S<highlight><bold>2206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0412" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0412&rsqb;</number> As described above, the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is able to inhibit data writing in place of the arrangement that the use of the remote entry function is not allowed the center side. In this state, the center side cannot rewrite the data but is able to know the value of the entry data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0413" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0413&rsqb;</number> The fact whether or not the remote entry function is possessed is not determined by the user of the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. It is determined at the time of, for example, installing the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> while inhibiting the latter change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0414" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0414&rsqb;</number> As the RMD switch, a service RMD switch which cannot be used for a usual user and a switch for the usual user are disposed, and the fact whether or not the RMD entry function is possessed is determined by the AND. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0415" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0415&rsqb;</number> The system according to this embodiment may be arranged in such a manner that a service reading permission switch which cannot be operated by a usual user is used in addition to the RMD switch and the write inhibition switch. Since the service reading permission switch cannot be used for a usual user, it must be disposed, for example, in the apparatus so as not to be operated usually. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</cross-reference> is a flow chart which illustrates the process to be perfotmed by the CPU <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at the time of transmitting the machine type declaration initial identification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0416" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0416&rsqb;</number> In a standby state, the states of the RMD switch, the write inhibition switch and the service reading permission switch are looked at predetermined intervals. If the switches are switched on, &ldquo;1&rdquo; is written on the RMD data <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, the write inhibition data <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the service reading permission data <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the RAM <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0418" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0418&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>2303</bold></highlight>, the service reading permission data <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is tested. If it is turned on (1), the bit of the NSF shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and denoting that the RMD function is possessed is made to be &ldquo;1&rdquo; and the write inhibition bit is made to be &ldquo;1&rdquo; to send the machine type declaration initial identification in step S<highlight><bold>2305</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0419" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0419&rsqb;</number> If the service permission data is turned off (0), the write inhibition data <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is tested in step S<highlight><bold>2304</bold></highlight>. If the write inhibition data is turned on (1), the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2305</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0420" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0420&rsqb;</number> If the write inhibition data <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is turned off (0), the bit of the NSF shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and denoting the RMD function is possessed is made to be &ldquo;1&rdquo; and the write inhibition bit is made to be &ldquo;0&rdquo; to send the machine type declaration initial identification in step S<highlight><bold>2306</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0421" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0421&rsqb;</number> If a discrimination is made in step S<highlight><bold>2302</bold></highlight> that the RMD data is turned off (0), the bit of the NSF shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and denoting the RMD function is possessed is made to be &ldquo;0&rdquo; to send the machine type declaration initial identification in step S<highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0422" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0422&rsqb;</number> As described above, the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sends the machine type declaration initial setting to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in accordance with setting of the switch. The facsiimle machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which has received the setting, makes a reference to the RMD function bit and that to the write inhibition bit. In accordance with the setting, the flow proceeds to the next phase so that data entry or data reading is performed. As a result, the remote facsimile machine is able to inhibit the usual user to write data by the remote data entry. Therefore, the entry data can be protected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0423" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0423&rsqb;</number> Although the RMD switch is made of metal in this embodiment, the RMD switch may be a software switch by means of a program or a operator&apos;s console input. In this case, data of the RMD switch is written on the data regions <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for reading the value of each switch whenever the data of the RMD switch is caused to enter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0424" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0424&rsqb;</number> Thirteenth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0425" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0425&rsqb;</number> The illustrated PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is called a RMD personal computer which edits and manages entry data to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> such as the input, edition and save of the remote data and which performs data communication with the center facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The remote entry system is formed by the RMD personal computer in such a manner that the system comprises a host program (called RMDHOST.EXE) <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, machine type and image plane data bases (DB) <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and :<highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, a file <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> such as a reservation file, and a program (RSHND) <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> for establishing the connection with peripheral units, such as a CRT and a printer and the like, and the communication adapter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by means of the interface RS232C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0426" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0426&rsqb;</number> The host program <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> is executed to support: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0433" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0433&rsqb;</number> In this system, a plurality of the remote facsimile machines <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are disposed each having peculiar data input format and data form. Therefore, the remote entry system must be supported with respect to the type of the facsimile machine which is expected to be developed in the future by managing the input form and the data form of the facsimile machine of the system by the data base. In accordance with information obtainable from the data base, the entry operation and entry data are checked to form a remote entry system enabling the machine type of the facsimile machine to be discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0434" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0434&rsqb;</number> The data base is categorized by an image plane data base <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for managing the image plane structure that does not depend upon the machine type and a machine type data base <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> that manages the peculiar data for each machine type. The structure of the machine type data base is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> and that of the image plane data base is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 80</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0435" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0435&rsqb;</number> The machine type data base (hereinafter called a &ldquo;DB&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is categorized to a machine type DB <highlight><bold>2111</bold></highlight> and a user DB <highlight><bold>2112</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</cross-reference>. The machine type DB <highlight><bold>2111</bold></highlight> has data for causing the user DB <highlight><bold>2112</bold></highlight> to input data. The user DB <highlight><bold>2112</bold></highlight> is composed of a plurality of tables each of which stores entry/reading data of the actual facsimile machines, the user DB <highlight><bold>2112</bold></highlight> being used as a temporary buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0436" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0436&rsqb;</number> This system has a function for setting the &ldquo;input level&rdquo; at the time of the data entry and adjusting the entry items in accordance with the input level. Therefore, data is set into the machine type DB to correspond to each &ldquo;input level&rdquo; at the time of entering/changing data. The contents of the machine type DB are as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</cross-reference> such that the menu image plane making data, input parameters and messages are set. The user DB is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</cross-reference>, composed of tables for storing data about each entry item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0437" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0437&rsqb;</number> The image plane DB, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C manages the structure of the image plane menu regardless of the machine type, the input parameters, and the message outputs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0438" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0438&rsqb;</number> &lt;Remote Data Entry (Remote Data Registry)&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0439" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0439&rsqb;</number> In order to execute the remote entry, the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> commences the host program (RDMHOST.EXE). As a result, the menu image plane is displayed in accordance with the procedure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0440" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0440&rsqb;</number> When the host program is commenced, a remote entry or remote maintenance mode selection (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82</cross-reference>) image plane is first displayed in step S<highlight><bold>2401</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 82, a</cross-reference> title line <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> is displayed at the leading portion of the menu image plane without exception. When the remote entry is selected from the foregoing image plane by the operator, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2403</bold></highlight> in which the entry level selection menu for limiting the entry is displayed. The menu image plane is formed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83</cross-reference> such that the operator selects any one of levels 1, 2 and 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0441" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0441&rsqb;</number> The entry level is categorized into the following three levels: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0442" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0442&rsqb;</number> Level 1: General entry </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0443" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0443&rsqb;</number> user data (polling ID excluded), name of calling side, one touch/shortened dial </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0444" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0444&rsqb;</number> Level 2: General entry&plus;additional entry </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0445" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0445&rsqb;</number> user data (polling ID excluded), name of calling side, one touch/shortened dial, group dial, F-network dial, mail post, confidence box, relay group and user software SW </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0446" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0446&rsqb;</number> Level 3: General entry&plus;additional entry&plus;service data entry </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0447" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0447&rsqb;</number> user data, name of calling side, one touch/shortened dial, group dial, F-network dial, mail post, confidence box, relay group and user software SW </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0448" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0448&rsqb;</number> Although the entry level is limited in item units in this embodiment, the polling ID of the user data can be caused to enter from the level 3. Further, entry of the detailed parameter, such as the transmission rate of the one touch/shortened dial and the overseas communication mode can be caused to enter from the level 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0449" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0449&rsqb;</number> When the entry level is selected, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight> in which the command menu image plane (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 84 and 85</cross-reference>) for the remote entry is displayed. Since the machine type and name of the remote facsimile machine cannot be known immediate after the host program has been commenced, only three items, that is, the novel entry, the data receipt and the data reading can be selected from the command menu to be displayed at the foregoing moment as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84</cross-reference>. By selecting the machine type and the name of the facsimile machine at the time of the novel entry or the like, an image plane shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</cross-reference> is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0450" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0450&rsqb;</number> When the change entry is selected from the command menu during the display of the menu in step S<highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight>, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2405</bold></highlight> in which the entry menu image planes shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 86, 87</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> displayed to correspond to the entry levels. Information for realizing the foregoing display is present in menu image plane making information (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</cross-reference>) in the machine type DB <highlight><bold>2111</bold></highlight>. Also information for shifting the entry menu to the entry process of each item or the command menu is also stored in the same portion. In step S<highlight><bold>2412</bold></highlight>, a process to be performed after any one of steps S<highlight><bold>2405</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>2411</bold></highlight> branched in accordance with the result of the selection made in step S<highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight> has been performed. If the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2413</bold></highlight>, a process loop is formed in steps S<highlight><bold>2405</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>2412</bold></highlight>. In this case, a process is selected from steps S<highlight><bold>2405</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>2411</bold></highlight> in accordance with the command made in the immediately before step S<highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0451" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0451&rsqb;</number> When the entry of the one touch/shortened dial entry is selected from the entry menu by the operator, an entry menu image plane as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90</cross-reference> is displayed in step <highlight><bold>2413</bold></highlight> and the input of entry data is waited for. The entry items are different among the levels 1, 2 and 3. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> illustrates the menu image plane for the level 1, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90</cross-reference> illustrates that for the level 2. Information for making the entry image plane is stored in the machine type DB (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 78</cross-reference>). When the input has been completed, the menu image plane is again displayed to cause the input to be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0452" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0452&rsqb;</number> The process immediately after step S<highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight> to step S<highlight><bold>2413</bold></highlight> are repeated until the operator completes the input of the needed entry data. When the entry operation has been completed by the operator, the flow returns to step S<highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight> in which the command selection menu image plane is displayed to wait for the input. The operator is able to select data printing if necessary during the repetition of the data input operations. In this case, data is printed out in step S<highlight><bold>2414</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0453" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0453&rsqb;</number> If data transmission is selected from the command selection image plane shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</cross-reference> in a state where the command menu is restored, entry data is sent to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> via the interface RS232C. The procedure of the communication to be performed between the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is the same as that according to the first embodiment. Thus, the remote entry operation is completed. The entry data is transmitted while being formed into the command and data of each entry item. An example of the foregoing structure is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</cross-reference>. Each command has an entry level set thereto which corresponds to the entry level caused to enter the data base. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</cross-reference>, command of the one touch/shortened dial number is &ldquo;DI&rdquo;, and data &ldquo;01&rdquo; input to the command is continued to be formed into data &ldquo;DT01&rdquo; at the time of the transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0454" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0454&rsqb;</number> As described above, the remote entry system according to this embodiment enables the entry level to be selected to correspond to information which is intended for the operator who performs the data entry operation to enter. As a result, the data entry operation can be performed while limiting the same. As a result, an accident that data which must be maintained is erroneously rewritten can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0455" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0455&rsqb;</number> &lt;Remote Data Reading&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0456" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0456&rsqb;</number> Further, the apparatus according to this embodiment is able to limit the subject data at the time of reading data from the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> depending upon the level. Also the foregoing process is realized by the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to execute the host program <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. The foregoing fact will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</cross-reference>. The process from step S<highlight><bold>2401</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight> is the same as that of the data entry operation. The description will be made from the moment at which the data receipt is selected from the command menu in step S<highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0457" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0457&rsqb;</number> When the data receipt is selected from the menu shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 84</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</cross-reference>, the flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>2410</bold></highlight>. When the machine type is instructed and the connection number is supplied, a reading command corresponding to the entry level is sent to the center facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. An example of the command is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</cross-reference>. The command shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</cross-reference> is sent in accordance with the entry level. If the level of each command is lower than the entry level, the reading command is sent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0458" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0458&rsqb;</number> When the command is sent from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, communication is made with the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by way of the center facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the entry data is read, the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> receives the reading data accumulated in the center facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> accumulating the data in the machine type data base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0459" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0459&rsqb;</number> As described above, the reading data can be limited depending upon the level at the time of reading the remote data. As a result, excessive data reading from the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by the operator of the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0460" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0460&rsqb;</number> A modification of the thirteenth embodiment will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0461" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0461&rsqb;</number> 1. The host program (RMDHOST.EXE) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</cross-reference> is commenced on the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and proceeds to an entry level selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0462" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0462&rsqb;</number> 2. Each entry level is inputted while displaying an image plane will which the input of a pass word is urged at the time of the level input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0463" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0463&rsqb;</number> 3. If the supplied pass work is different from the previously set pass word, proceeding is inhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0464" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0464&rsqb;</number> 4. If the pass word is correct, proceeding to the next process is permitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0465" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0465&rsqb;</number> 5. The process after the shift to the next process is the same as that according to the thirteenth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0466" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0466&rsqb;</number> The foregoing process is arranged as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95</cross-reference>, the process from step S<highlight><bold>2401</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>2414</bold></highlight> given the same step numbers are the same as those of the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</cross-reference>. Steps S<highlight><bold>2501</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2502</bold></highlight> placed between step S<highlight><bold>2403</bold></highlight> and step S<highlight><bold>2404</bold></highlight> are peculiar processes in this modification and correspond to the foregoing operation 2 (step S<highlight><bold>2501</bold></highlight>) and the operations 4 (step S<highlight><bold>2502</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0467" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0467&rsqb;</number> As a result, the selection of the entry level is performed with the pass word at the time of executing the remote entry by the operator. Therefore, an erroneous level input and an intended erroneous setting of items by an operator can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0468" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0468&rsqb;</number> Fourteenth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0469" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0469&rsqb;</number> An object of this embodiment is to reduce maintenance cost by grasping the state of use of the facsimile machine by obtaining information of the remote facsimile machine by making use of the remote data entry function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0470" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0470&rsqb;</number> The RAM <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is allocated with counter regions <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> for storing the number of A4 size sheets and B4 size sheets transmitted and received and another counter region <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> for storing the number of the transmission operations. The foregoing counters are collectively called P.G.P counters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0471" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0471&rsqb;</number> The remote entry system according to this embodiment comprises the procedure of the remote entry between the center facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> arranged as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0472" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0472&rsqb;</number> The operation of the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment will now be described with reference to a flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 98</cross-reference>. The process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 98</cross-reference> is realized by causing the CPU <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to execute the program stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is able to read/record both A4 size and B4 size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0473" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0473&rsqb;</number> &lt;Counting of Number of Sheets&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0474" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0474&rsqb;</number> When the usual image transmission/receiving operations are performed by the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the number of sheet are recorded in a transmission sheet counter/received sheet counter for storing the sum of the transmitted/received number of sheets stored in the memory <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0475" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0475&rsqb;</number> In the transmitted sheet counter, the number of sheets depending upon the size is recorded which have been transmitted after a process of transmitting an image for one page has been completed. That is, the count of an A4 transmission counter <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> is increased when an A4 sheet is transmitted, while that of a B4 transmission counter <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> is increased when a B4 sheet is transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0476" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0476&rsqb;</number> In the received sheet counter, the number of sheets depending upon the size is recorded after a recording process for one page has been completed. That is, the counter of an A4 received sheet counter <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> is increased at the time of receiving the A4 sheet, while that of a B4 received sheet counter is increased at the time of receiving the B4 sheet. Further, the count of a transmission number counter <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> is increased. The values of the foregoing counters are maintained even if the power source is turned off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0477" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0477&rsqb;</number> &lt;Remote Reading of Counter&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0478" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0478&rsqb;</number> The counter group having count data is read on to the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by means of communication by the following process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0479" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0479&rsqb;</number> In order to read the P.G.P counters (<highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>) from a remote position, a program for reading the counters is commenced on the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</cross-reference> illustrates an image plane displayed on the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> due to the operation of the program thus-commenced. The operator inputs needed items in accordance with the displayed menu image plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0480" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0480&rsqb;</number> When the input has been completed, the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> makes a message to be transmitted to the center facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and transmits it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0481" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0481&rsqb;</number> When the operator has inputted the connection number, selected the execution of reading of the P.G.P counter and depressed the return key, the message notifying them is sent to the center facsimile machine The side (the center facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) for executing the remote reading receives the message to commence the communication with the remote facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in accordance with the control procedure shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

If a negative discrimination is made, the flow returns to the data transfer phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0547" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0547&rsqb;</number> The remote entry control operation is performed as described above. In this case, the facsimile machine simply sends data to the remote apparatus but it does not relate to the remote entry process while permitting data to pass through. The data transmission state is checked by the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by way of the interface RS232C during the communication. When a command to delete the command file is sent from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the interface RS232C, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> deletes the command file (the foregoing internal file) and thus the data entry process is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0548" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0548&rsqb;</number> When data is read, a command to transfer the file stored in the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is sent from the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the interface RS232C. As a result, the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> transfers the read data to the PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The PC <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> causes data to enter the internal data base DB, and then deletes read data from the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus, the process is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0549" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0549&rsqb;</number> As described above, the present invention comprises steps of: sequentially converting entry character code data to be caused to enter the facsimile apparatus or the plurality of remote facsimile apparatuses into exclusive character code in the facsimile apparatus while referring to a first conversion table in accordance with a data entry command issued by the external unit; causing the exclusive code array thus-converted to be temporarily stored in the external unit; and transferring the stored exclusive character code to the facsimile apparatus or the plurality of remote facsimile apparatuses to be caused to enter the same. Therefore, the character code for exclusively use in the connected facsimile apparatus or the plurality of remote facsimile apparatus can be transferred from outside to be caused to enter them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0550" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0550&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention comprises steps of: receiving entry character code data from the facsimile apparatus or the plurality of remote facsimile apparatuses in accordance with a data reading command issued by the external unit; sequentially converting the entry character code data into exclusive character code in the facsimile apparatus while referring to a first conversion table; causing the exclusive code array thus-converted to be temporarily stored in the external unit; inversely converting the stored exclusive character code array into the entry character code data array while referring to a second conversion table in accordance with an instruction to display or print the stored exclusive character code array; and reading the converted entry character code array to display or print the same. Therefore, the entry data about the facsimile apparatuses on a network can collectively be managed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0551" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0551&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the character code corresponding to special characters for use in only the facsimile machine can be transferred from an external apparatus. Therefore, the special characters for use in only a desired facsimile machine can easily be caused to enter from the connected external apparatus. Further, the same contents as the entry data can be displayed or output by the external apparatus. Therefore, the data entry operation and the display and printing of the entry data can be performed from outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0552" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0552&rsqb;</number> In addition to the foregoing embodiments, an arrangement may be employed in which copying machines, printers, image storage units and image processing units and the like are connected to the facsimile machine <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and internal data in the foregoing apparatuses is read out, caused to enter and rewritten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0553" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0553&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been described in its preferred form with a certain degree of particularly, it is understood that the present disclosure of the preferred form has been changed in the details of construction and the combination and arrangement of parts may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed. </paragraph>
