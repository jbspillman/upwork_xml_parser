<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to interactive television systems capable of two-way communication with networked computer systems operating as information service providers, in particular Internet service providers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The Internet may be viewed as a large group of networked computer systems, each of which has a distinct alphanumeric address. A user terminal which seeks to receive data from one of the networked computer systems will send a command to the desired Internet address through the network to that system requesting that a particular set of data be sent to the terminal. The user terminals are connected to the network through the established telephone system in the user&apos;s community. An Internet address may be limited to the identity of the particular networked computer system, or may include additional information which directs the networked computer system to send a particular set of Internet data. The additional information may include a subdirectory, a file name, or both, which instructs the networked computer system which portion of data is desired by the requesting terminal. The system will thereafter send the requested data through the network to the terminal. Further exchanges of data may or may not take place between the terminal and the networked computer system, depending upon the desires of the terminal user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The World Wide Web (WWW/Internet) is an Internet network designed for popular use. Apparatus sold under the trademark &ldquo;WebTV,&rdquo; provided by Philips-Magnavox and Sony, allow television viewers to access the World Wide Web through their televisions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is therefore desirable to enhance television viewing and Internet browsing by providing a more intimate interface between the viewers television and the Internet access apparatus so that both television viewing and Internet browsing may be performed simultaneously, and preferably interactively such that the Internet data relates to the television program being viewed. </paragraph>

A television signal provider supplies a plurality of television signals to the tuner of each user interface unit, wherein at least one of the television signals has embedded data including a particular data address site. Information representing the particular data address site is displayed simultaneously with the television program on the display device, e.g., either as a graphical icon or text. A data service provider in two-way connection with the modem of each user interface site retrieves and transmits data corresponding to a data address site requested by an individual user interface unit for display on the display device of that user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of the invention, a display controller for coupling to a display device and to a data retrieval terminal in two-way communication with a data service provider is provided. The display controller includes a tuner for receiving a television signal containing a television program and at least one embedded data unit including a data address site, means for extracting the at least one embedded data unit from the television signal, a memory for storing the at least one data unit, and a video display generator. The display controller also includes a microcontroller coupled to the tuner and the extracting means and the memory for storing the at least one data unit in the memory, controlling the video display generator to display the data site address on the display device simultaneously with the television program, selectively retrieving the data site address from the memory in response to a user request, controlling the data retrieval terminal to request data corresponding to the user selected data address site from the data service provider, and controlling the video display generator to format and display the requested data received from the data service provider on the display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> According to yet another embodiment of the invention, a method is provided for enhancing viewing of a television program with interactive information retrieval. The method includes the steps of, at a television signal provider, embedding at least one data unit comprising a data site address into a television signal containing a television program. Then, at a user site, receiving the television signal, extracting the data unit from the television signal, displaying information representative of the data address site simultaneously with the television program on a display device, and then storing the data address site in a memory. Once the user selects the information representative of the data address site, a connection is established with a data service provider having access to data corresponding to the selected data address site, the data corresponding to the data address site is requested and transmitted from the data service provider to the user site. The retrieved data is then formatted and displayed on the display device at the user site.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, television programs are linked to data and/or graphics at Internet sites to expand the on screen information available to a television viewer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> illustrate a specific embodiment of the invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the reference numerals refer to the same elements described in U.S. application Serial No. 08/475,395 filed on Jun. 6, 1995, the disclosure of which is incorporated fully herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> source of television signals <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such as a terrestrial antenna, or a cable is connected to a television tuner <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The output of tuner <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a modulated intermediate frequency signal containing video and audio television information. Tuner <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected by an intermediate frequency amplifier (IF AMP) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a picture detector (PICTURE DET) <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a sound detector (SOUND DET) <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which produce base band video and audio signals, respectively. The audio signal is coupled by a sound amplifier (SOUND AMP) <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to a loudspeaker <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The video signal is coupled by a video amplifier not shown to one input of a switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Sound detector <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and picture detector <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are connected to the audio and video inputs, respectively, of a video cassette recorder (VCR) <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. (Alternatively, television signal source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could be directly connected to the RF input of VCR <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, if its internal tuner and demodulating circuitry is to be utilized.) The output of VCR <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is connected to the other input of switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The output of switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected to one input of a conventional picture-in-picture (PIP) integrated circuit chip <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The output of PIP chip <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is connected to the video input of a television receiver or monitor (TV) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a screen (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Internet data, including Internet site addresses, is stored in Internet data memory <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Internet data memory <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is connected to a microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that is programmed to control the operation of the described equipment (Internet data memory <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> could be part of the RAM of microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>). An operating program for microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is stored in a read only memory (ROM) <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A viewer input device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, preferably in the form of a remote IR controller, is coupled to microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to provide commands from the viewer. A video processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is coupled to microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When the viewer wishes to see Internet site addresses, microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> recalls a portion of the Internet data from memory <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and couples it to video processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, where the Internet site addresses are formatted for display. Preferably, the information stored in video processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a bit map of what is displayed on the screen of television receiver <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Video processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected to the other input of PIP chip <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Preferably, viewer input device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> controls microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by cursor movement on the screen of television receiver <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. To this end, microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and video processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are coupled to a cursor position register <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. (Alternatively, the viewer can select items of information displayed on the screen by keying into viewer input device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> code numbers assigned to these items.) Microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is also coupled to tuner <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for channel change, to VCR <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for play/record selection and start/stop, to switch <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for selection of one of its inputs, and to PIP chip <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for selection of the mode of PIP operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, an Internet service provider (ISP) <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is connected to microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by a transmission link <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> such as a telephone network or a television cable. An interface device such as a telephone or cable modem <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, or digital interface device (not shown) for a fiber optic connection, couples transmission link <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> if necessary. ISP <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is connected to an Internet backbone in well known fashion to access data at any site on the World Wide Web, or preferably the Internet generally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> To enable a television viewer to access data about a television program that the viewer is watching, Internet data is embedded in the vertical blanking interval (VBI) of the television signal carrying the program. According to one embodiment, the Internet data includes the names and Internet addresses of a plurality of Internet sites. When the television signal carrying the program being watched is captured by tuner <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the Internet data embedded in its VBI is stripped out by a VBI decoder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> coupled to microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> then stores the data in Internet data memory <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The memory addresses of the Internet names are linked to the Internet addresses in memory <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> graphical icon <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> appears on the screen of television <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when the television program is displayed full screen, i.e., in a television mode, to inform the viewer that Internet data accompanies the television signal and is stored in memory <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Icon <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> can appear for a limited time period after the television program is first displayed or for the entire time period of the program. If the viewer wishes to access an Internet site in connection with the television program, the viewer presses mode button <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> on a remote controller <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, which introduces an Internet mode of operation described below. Microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is programmed to carry out this operation. By repeatedly pressing mode button <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the viewer can toggle back and forth between the television mode and the Internet mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the Internet site information is placed in a picture-in-picture (&ldquo;PIP&rdquo;) window on the television screen such that the Internet site information may be viewed simultaneously with the television program. Conversely, the television signal may be placed in a PIP window on the television screen as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, the Internet site information occupies the majority of the television screen, and the television program is displayed in a PIP window. In this manner, the television video signal may be viewed simultaneously with the Internet information, and thus supplement the information provided to the viewer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the video portion of the television program last viewed in the television mode is displayed in area <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the audio portion is reproduced by the speaker system of the television set. As an option, a textual description of the program is displayed in an area <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and information about the television program, i.e., program title, station name, and channel number are displayed in a banner <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> underneath areas <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. A message is displayed at the top of an area <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to prompt the viewer to select from a number of Internet site names displayed in area <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> by moving a cursor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> with arrow keys <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). For example, the Internet site names may be related to the particular program (&ldquo;1. &lsquo;MARRIED WITH CHILDREN&rsquo; TRIVIA&rdquo;), the particular broadcaster (&ldquo;2. TONIGHT ON FOX (SCHEDULE)&rdquo;), general services offered by the system provider (&ldquo;3. SPORTS&rdquo;; &ldquo;4. SHOPPING&rdquo;), or directed to the particular user&apos;s Internet account (&ldquo;5. E-MAIL&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> After an Internet site name is selected, the viewer presses INFO button <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on controller <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As a result, the Internet site address to which the selected Internet site name is linked is retrieved from memory <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and sent through the telephone or cable interface to ISP <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Once the microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has been directed to initiate data acquisition, it will instruct the modem <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to connect to an Internet service provider (ISP). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> After establishing a connection to the ISP, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> initiates a data request from the Internet site address which was received along with the graphical icon transmitted in the data unit. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> thereafter receives the requested Internet data, and stores it in RAM. The requested Internet data may include graphics, text, or a combination of both. After receiving the Internet data, the microprocessor may or may not terminate the modem connection to the ISP, depending upon the design of the embodiment, or the configuration options set by the viewer. (If desired, this finction of microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> could be carried out by commercial equipment sold under the trademark &ldquo;WebTV,&rdquo; provided by Philips/Magnavox and Sony.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The information at the addressed Internet site is downloaded from ISP <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> over transmission link <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and then displayed on the screen simultaneously with the television program to which the information relates, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, after being composed by video processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the name of the Internet site can be displayed above the text of the information from the Internet site. If the television program is a television series such as &ldquo;Married With Children,&rdquo; the displayed information could be an Internet &ldquo;page&rdquo; trivia about the show (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), merchandising and home shopping information, or a link to a fan e-mail site. The viewer then navigates about the Internet site in the manner dictated by the viewer&apos;s software to find the desired information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Only an initial portion of the Internet data is displayed, as the amount of Internet data received will likely exceed the amount conveniently displayable at one time. The viewer may &ldquo;scroll&rdquo; through the remainder of the Internet data or &ldquo;page,&rdquo; at his or her discretion, in one embodiment by utilizing arrow keys on a remote control. The user interface of the page viewing may be accomplished in a conventional manner, e.g., in the manner of a typical PC-based web browser, or the user interface associated with WebTV, provided by Philips-Magnavox, or Sony. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> If desired, the display of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> could be eliminated. In other words, only one Internet site address would be embedded in the VBI of the television signal and the viewer would not make an Internet site selection. In this case, inclusion of the Internet site name is optional, because the viewer does not have a choice of Internet sites. When the viewer wishes to access Internet information about a program marked with an icon, the viewer presses button <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the VBI Internet site address is sent through the telephone or cable interface to ISP <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and the display of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> appears directly on the screen with the VBI Internet site name. Preferably, the television program is displayed full screen until the data retrieved from the ISP <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is available for display, i.e., after establishing a connection with the ISP <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, requesting the data, etc. Preferably, the graphical icon <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> ceases to be displayed once the viewer selects the Internet data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In a typical Internet &ldquo;web page,&rdquo; there are &ldquo;links&rdquo; to other Internet addresses, which provide alternative or complementary data to that found in the originally displayed web page. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a user may select one of these links with a remote control, utilizing arrow keys <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and/or on-screen cursor <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the answer to the trivia question is contained in a linked web page the viewer can select to confirm his or her response. These links are commonly referred to as &ldquo;hypertext&rdquo; links. If a link is selected, the microprocessor transmits the desired address to the ISP, and thereafter receives and displays the newly-received Internet data in the manner described above. Thus, if it is desirable to allow the viewer to link to additional Internet site addresses, the microprocessor should maintain the modem connection to the ISP <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> until directed by the user to terminate the connection. In this manner, the repeated request and receipt of successive pages will not necessitate delays associated with initiating a connection to the ISP <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In order to accommodate the simultaneous viewing of both the Internet site Internet information and the television signal, particularized display formats may be used. In a further embodiment, the information for the Internet site is formatted to fit around the PIP window in which the television program is displayed, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Typical Internet data received over the World Wide Web is transmitted in HyperText Markup Language (&ldquo;HTML&rdquo;). A typical HTML file includes text, graphics, and instructions for formatting the text and graphics on a screen, along with other embedded commands. A computer or other terminal displaying an HTML file will format the file for display on the screen, based in part upon the embedded instructions for formatting the text and graphics, and based in part upon the requirements for aesthetic and efficient display of the information on the particular viewing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> When displaying two video signals simultaneously using the PIP format, typically one video signal occupies the majority of the viewing screen, while the second video signal is displayed in or near to one corner of the television screen and typically occupies one quarter of the screen or less. With this type of display format, the second video signal obscures a not insubstantial portion of the first video signal. This can result in an inefficient and undesirable display of information to the viewer when PIP is used in connection with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Hence one aspect of the present invention includes a microprocessor adapted to format the HTML file received over the Internet in such a manner as to accommodate the television program signal in one portion of the television screen. In this manner, the television program signal may be viewed simultaneously with the Internet HTML information, without obscuring any of the Internet HTML information by the television program signal. For example, if it is desired to place the television program signal in a PIP window in the top right hand corner of the television screen, the HTML file should be reformatted by the WebTV terminal (or other Internet display device associated with the system) to display information only in the remainder of the screen, such that it will not be obscured by the overlaid television program signal. In this instance, the HTML file would be reformatted into the &ldquo;L&rdquo; shaped display <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, so that the right hand corner of the Internet video signal contains no information to be obscured by the television program signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the user interface of this embodiment is designed so the television remote controller <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can also be used to navigate the website, in addition to operating the television and guide functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> According to another embodiment of the invention, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> conventional television <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is provided with a Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI) decoder <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and a separate Internet access type terminal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> connected to the Internet, for example apparatus sold under the trademark &ldquo;WebTV&rdquo;. A microprocessor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> that controls the operation of the television <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is programmed to perform the functions described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The Internet access terminal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> includes a microprocessor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, a Random Access Memory <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (RAM), a modem <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, a user input device such as a remote control <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or a keyboard <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, and a video signal generator <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. In typical operation, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of the Internet access terminal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> will receive user input regarding particular data to be received over the Internet; utilizing the modem <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the microprocessor will receive the desired data (typically a &ldquo;web page&rdquo; consisting of formatted text and/or graphic images) and output a video signal suitable for displaying the desired data on the screen of an attached television monitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Television <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has a tuner <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> and RAM <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> coupled to Internet access terminal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The Internet access terminal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> sends a video signal to the television set. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is provided with an infrared transmitter <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to send commands to the Internet access terminal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Additionally, keyboard <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> or remote controller <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is configured to send infrared commands to either the Internet access terminal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> via IR receiver <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> or to the television <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> via IR receiver <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The Internet access terminal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is coupled via a standard telephone line to ISP <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which functions in the displayed embodiment as an ISP. The server is configured to send and receive data over the World Wide Web (WWW/Intemet) to and from computer systems networked thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention corresponding to the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, data representative of on-screen graphical icon, along with an associated Internet site address, is transmitted as a single data unit, packet, or group of packets in the VBI of a television signal. The VBI has been demonstrated over the past two decades to be a suitable vehicle for the transmission of digital data along with a television signal. In particular, the VBI is well-adapted for the transmission of relatively small packets of data. The graphical icon <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is displayed on-screen with the associated television signal as described above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG.2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A television signal incorporating the above mentioned data unit is sent by a television station <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, and is carried by a cable provider. In alternative embodiments, the television signal may be sent by conventional broadcast, or by satellite. When the television signal is carried by cable, the user&apos;s home is typically equipped with a cable decoder <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, which extracts the tuned video signal, which is the television signal combined with the data unit in the VBI. The cable decoder <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is capable of being controlled by the microprocessor by infrared transmitter (not shown in the drawings). The video signal is thereafter delivered to a VCR <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which also is capable of being controlled by the microprocessor by infrared transmitter (not shown in the drawings). Both the video signal and the data in the VBI of the video signal are delivered to the television <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. VBI decoder <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> for separating the data in the VBI from the video signal, and for delivering that data to the microprocessor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Data units may be transmitted in the VBI of all channels serving a particular broadcast region, or they may be included by program creators (producers, advertisers, etc) in the VBI of the videotape provided to a broadcaster. In this manner, when the program is replayed for broadcast by a broadcaster, the data unit containing the Internet site address and other information is present in the broadcast and may be received by any apparatus viewing the program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The information at the Internet site corresponding to the transmitted Internet site address is preferably related to the content of the program currently being telecast in the television signal, which contains the data unit transmitted in the VBI. Preferably, a descriptive title for the Internet site address that will enable the viewer to distinguish the Internet site from other Internet sites is also included in the data unit. When the data unit transmitted in the VBI is received at a television receiver with the program, it is stored in a temporary buffer portion <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the RAM <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the storage capacity of the temporary buffer is one data unit, so that each new data unit overwrites and replaces the previously received data unit. Alternatively, each successively received data unit is placed on the top of a stack in RAM, so that previously received data units will still be accessible to the microprocessor if desired by the viewer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The extracted data includes data representative of an on-screen graphical icon and an Internet site address, as referred to above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The microprocessor superimposes the graphical icon <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> on a portion of the displayed video signal, thus indicating to the user that additional information concerning the television program is available through the Internet. The graphical icon will preferably be placed in an unobtrusive portion of the television signal, e.g. such that it is displayed on a corner of the television monitor as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The viewer is thereby alerted to the presence of additional information concerning the displayed television program. At the viewer&apos;s initiation, the microprocessor may begin the process of acquiring the desired additional information over the Internet. The viewer initiates the process of data acquisition by pressing SELECT button <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> on remote controller <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) or other viewer input device. Alternatively, the viewer initiates the process by pointing a cursor <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, with a mouse or other pointing device (not shown), to the location of the on-screen icon <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, as shown on the exemplary full screen display of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Alternatively, the viewer may direct the microprocessor to store the Internet site address and descriptive title in the manner referred to above for later use responsive to an on-screen selection process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The graphical icon <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is overlaid on the screen as soon as it is received and is thus displayed simultaneously with the program. If the viewer wishes to receive more information about the displayed program, e.g., more details about a commercial, additional details concerning a news story, or statistics about a sporting event, the viewer presses a STORE button <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> on remote controller <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) to transfer the Internet site address and the corresponding descriptive title, e.g., &ldquo;Today&apos;s NFL Game Scores&rdquo; to a directory portion of the RAM and to extinguish the icon on the screen. Any number of Internet site addresses can be stored in the directory in this manner as the television viewing session progresses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the viewer may press a button <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> on the remote control, designated by &ldquo;INFO,&rdquo; or some other informative designation, to access a menu of options. One option is to store the Internet site address and associated descriptive title. Another option may be to immediately access the Internet and obtain the additional information. Other options consistent with the disclosure of the present invention may be present on the menu presented to the viewer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> According to yet another embodiment corresponding to the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the directory is managed as a web browser bookmark memory. The website addresses and titles are stored in the directory until they are deleted or replaced by new addresses and titles on a first-in-first-out basis when the directory is full. Alternatively, the newly received website addresses replace old addresses and titles on a next-in, least-used basis, i.e., when a new website address and title is received, it is stored in memory in place of either the most infrequently accessed website address/title in the bookmark memory, or in place of the least-recently accessed website address/title. Preferably, the microprocessor is programmed to permit the individual user to select which mode of memory management to utilize. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> When the viewer wishes to establish a connection to the Internet site of one of the stored addresses, the viewer presses a MENU button <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> to display the Internet site titles, and optionally the corresponding Internet site addresses, stored in the directory. The viewer selects the desired title with on screen cursor <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and then presses a SELECT button <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. As a result, the microprocessor transfers the corresponding Internet site address to the Internet access terminal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, the Internet site is connected to the Internet access terminal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and information from the Internet site is displayed on the screen instead of the television program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment corresponding to the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the present invention is incorporated into a cable decoder <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. In a standard cable decoder, there are present a microprocessor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, an on-screen display facility <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a VBI decoder <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> (in addressable decoders), and a tuner <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Thus, the present invention may be implemented in a cable decoder environment with the addition of a modem <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> for data connection to an ISP, and sufficient RAM for the receipt and display of the Internet &ldquo;web page.&rdquo; As bi-directional transmission by cable becomes available, the telephone modem <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can be eliminated and the cable system, in conjunction with suitable hardware, can be used to connect the user terminal to the Internet or other data provider. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment, rather than receiving the desired additional information over the Internet, a dedicated computer system <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> could be utilized. In a system of this nature, the dedicated system would serve as a clearinghouse or dedicated database for the storage of the related information. When a broadcaster desired to provide additional information, it transfers the additional information and a unique identifying code to the centralized database utilizing conventional techniques. Additionally, the information may be transmitted to the centralized database on a television or cable signal. Finally, the additional information may be supplied to the user in the form of a CD-ROM or other large scale portable memory device. Thereafter, when a user desired additional information, the microprocessor would initiate a connection to the dedicated system to receive and display the additional information in the manner described above. Such a dedicated system could be integrated with the Internet so that some information could be supplied to the user by Internet and some information could be supplied by the dedicated system. The dedicated system could be the user&apos;s own personal computer system so that the data site addresses received over the VBI correspond to data previously stored, by one of the above-described methods, in the user&apos;s personal computer, e.g., in a CD-ROM or transferred by modem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, Internet data at an Internet site may also be linked to particular television programs to expand the information available to an Internet browser. Specifically, Internet text or graphics at an Internet site is marked with an icon or designated as hypertext to represent that a related television program is scheduled for telecast. If desired, different icons could be used to distinguish between currently telecast programs and programs to be telecast in the future. The icons are linked to data at the Internet site representing channel, day, time, and length (i.e., CDTL) or the related television programs. This aspect of the invention is particularly convenient for a television aficionado who is reading Television Guide-like articles on line to click on hypertext in the article to set up a television program for viewing or recording. If the Internet user wishes to watch or record a television program, the user clicks on the icon with a mouse, e.g., one click to watch and two clicks to record, and the CDTL data is transmitted by the Internet connection to the WebTV terminal at the user&apos;s location. The WebTV terminal couples the CDTL data to the microprocessor. If the CDTL data identifies a currently telecast program, the microprocessor operates the television receiver or the VCR, depending upon whether one click or two clicks were entered, and sets the appropriate tuner to the designated channel. If the CDTL data identifies a future program, the microprocessor stores the CDTL data in the recording/play stack for use in recording or play at the designated time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is therefore capable of performing the functions described above in accordance with the present invention. In addition, the ISP is capable of providing data to be incorporated into the VBI of the transmitted television signal which notifies a particular user that he or she has received electronic mail. Thus, when viewing television, the viewer may be informed by an on-screen icon <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that he or she has received electronic mail, and the viewer may thereafter direct the microprocessor to control the Internet access terminal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to obtain and display the electronic mail message or messages. When this function is implemented, the VBI includes an identification code or address that uniquely designates a particular viewer&apos;s apparatus, so that only the designated apparatus at the site where the electronic mail message is received actually displays the electronic mail icon. The electronic mail data units with identification codes are routed to the respective broadcast regions where the recipients are located. The data to be broadcast to a particular region may be provided to a network affiliate in that region to be inserted into the VBI before broadcast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The data unit transmitted to a particular user to inform him or her that he has received electronic mail may also include the subject or sender of the mail message. In this manner, the viewer may view the subject or sender of the mail message on the television screen without connecting to an ISP to receive the entire mail message. The viewer may therefore &ldquo;screen&rdquo; his or her E-mail, and connect only when the mail message is of interest or importance to him or her. Data units indicating the presence of electronic mail, or other uniquely addressed data units may be transmitted on all channels of a particular broadcast region, or may be provided on a single channel to which the tuner tunes when the television is not in use. When not in use, the microprocessor may therefore monitor the VBI of this single channel and obtain any directly addressed data units. Alternatively, an apparatus may be equipped with two tuners, one of which is constantly tuned to the channel containing the VBI data, and one of which is used to tune to television signals for display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> potential on-screen icons include an icon <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> representative of the availability of additional information in a video program. For example, an extended advertisement, or how-to show, or local information program may be available at another time or on another channel. By pressing an appropriate button on the remote control, the microprocessor may be directed to record that show. Data in the data unit representative of CDTL may be placed into a location in the RAM, such that the VCR is set to record the program at the time of its airing. In addition, a data unit may be transmitted and directed to a particular user&apos;s apparatus which carries a command to the microprocessor to record a television program at a particular channel, date, time, and length. If a user is not present to program his or her VCR for recording, he or she may direct that a data unit be sent to his or her apparatus with a command to record a particular program or programs. The command could be complex recording sequence configured for serially broadcast television programs such as a miniseries which airs at different times on different nights of the week; This can be particularly useful when a user has forgotten to program a future recording, but has left his or her home. The user may direct the transfer of such a data unit using electronic mail to an ISP, or by telephone link to a location which will direct the actual transfer of a data unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Another potential on-screen icon is an icon representative of an Internet website address link <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. As described above in detail, the user may select this icon to obtain an Internet site address for locating and viewing additional information concerning a particular news show, sports event, or advertiser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A third potential on-screen icon is an icon representative of a VCRPlus&plus;link <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> which may be provided, for example, in connection with an advertisement for another television program. When a user presses the appropriate keys on his or her remote control, the microprocessor stores the CDTL of that program, which is transmitted in the data unit, and records or displays the program at its time of airing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> A fourth potential on-screen icon is an icon representative of a Buy Link <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> which may be provided to send an order to the provider of goods or services vial the incorporated modem <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, or via the WebTV terminal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor will be guided by the data in the data unit as to the address or other location to send the viewer&apos;s order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As an alternative to the standard set of icons, which represent the type of option available to the user, the data unit may include a particular descriptive icon which will be displayed on the screen. For example, the transmitted icon could consist of a digitized version of a manufacturer&apos;s logo. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> If the particular embodiment is adapted for displaying standardized icons as set forth in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the digital data representative of the graphical icons could be stored in RAM or ROM at the viewer&apos;s location, with the data unit including a pointer to refer to the stored graphical icon. In this manner, the amount of data to be transmitted may be reduced. In addition, if specialized logos are desired to be used in addition to or in place of standardized icons, the digital data representative of these icons may be sent in bulk at a particular time (such as the late night when the television set is not likely to be used). Afterwards, the data unit need only include a pointer to the graphical icon, rather than the full set of digital data representative of the particular icon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> incorporated into the television is equipped with an infrared transmitter suitable for transferring data to a portable device <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is substantially similar to the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, with identical components having the same reference numbers. The transmitter incorporated into microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may also be provided in the form of a direct wire link, radio frequency transmitter, or some other means for providing digital data to the portable device. The microprocessor is adapted to transmit the received Internet site address and/or the descriptive title thereof to the portable device for storage therein. The portable device must therefore be adapted to receive the transmission as well as to store the transmission in RAM or some other storage means, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Once the Internet site address and/or descriptive title have been stored in the portable device, the user may thereafter transfer the stored Internet site address to a personal computer <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> suitable for connection to the Internet. The portable device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is therefore equipped with a transmitting apparatus, possibly infrared, radio frequency, or direct wire link for sending the digital data representative of the Internet site address to the personal computer. Once received by the personal computer via an interface <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, the user may connect to the Internet and obtain the additional information over the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The portable device may take the form of a portable computer, such as a Pilot or Newton, or may take the form of a portable Internet terminal, which itself is operable to connect to the Internet through an ISP, possibly by wireless two-way communications such as a cellular telephone connection. Alternatively, the portable computer could be removed from the system and the microprocessor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> could be linked in direct communication with the user&apos;s personal computer <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, e.g., by IR emission of information and command signals to PC interface <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The described embodiments of the invention are only considered to be preferred and illustrative of the inventive concept; the scope of the invention is not to be restricted to such embodiment. Various and numerous other arrangements may be devised by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of this invention. </paragraph>
