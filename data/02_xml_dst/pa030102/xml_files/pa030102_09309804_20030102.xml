<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The development of polymer composite liquid oxygen (LOX) tanks is a critical step in creating the next generation of launch vehicles. A composite LOX tank will weigh significantly less than conventional metal tanks. This benefit of reduced weight is critical to enable future launch vehicles to meet required mass fractions. The high strength and low weight of a composite tank allows for a lighter weight craft and/or higher payload capacity which results in lower costs per pound to place an object in orbit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="A-0002" lvl="0">The unique, nontraditional idea described here is to use resin-based composite materials to make such a composite tank or other oxygen carrying component such as a feedline. Polymer composites have traditionally been regarded as being more flammable than metals and therefore deemed not oxygen compatible. However, several halogenated composites have been tested for their ability to withstand ignition in the presence of oxygen, and have shown to be resistant to ignition. A halogenated composite material is a fiber reinforced composite that contains an element or elements from column 7A in the Periodic Table of Elements. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to liquid oxygen tanks and feedline system of a composite material construction and more specifically to resins containing halogen elements or laminates subjected to halogenated treatments, either of which may be suitable for use as an oxygen tank or feedline system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. General Background </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The development of polymer composite liquid oxygen tanks is a critical step in creating the next generation of launch vehicles. Future reusable launch vehicles need to minimize the gross liftoff weight (GLOW) by reducing the dry mass fraction. The (dry) mass fraction is the weight of the launch vehicle without fuel divided by the weight of the vehicle with fuel. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is graph showing the effect of mass fraction on GLOW. Indicated on the graph are the RLV mass fraction target region as well as the mass fraction of the RLV without the weight reduction that composites could provide. It is clear that the benefit of composite tanks are critical to enable future launch vehicles to meet required mass fractions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The required mass fraction is possible due to the reduction of weight that composite materials can provide. Traditional oxygen tanks are usually made from metals. The space shuttle external tank (ET) has historically been made from 2219 aluminum and more recently 2195 aluminum/lithium alloy. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a comparison between these two aluminum alloys and a typical composite material for a liquid oxygen tank for a launch vehicle. The chart shows that a composite tank provides up to 41% and 28% weight savings when compared to 2219 and 2195 aluminum tanks, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In addition to meeting the required mass fraction, a liquid oxygen tank must be compatible with oxygen. The ASTM definition for oxygen compatibility is the &ldquo;ability of a substance to coexist with both oxygen and a potential source(s) of ignition within the acceptable risk parameter of the user.&rdquo; It is imperative that materials are selected that will resist any type of detrimental, combustible reaction when exposed to usage environments. Typically, non-metallic materials are not used in these applications because most are easily ignited in the presence of oxygen. However, there are some polymeric materials with inert chemistries that may be used for this application and resist ignition. These chemistries were evaluated by fabricating coupons and testing them with various ignition mechanisms in the presence of liquid and gaseous oxygen. The testing performed reflected situations in launch vehicles that could be potential sources of ignition in composite. These tests included pressurized mechanical impact, particle impact, puncture, puncture of damaged, oxygen-soaked samples, electrostatic discharge, friction, and pyrotechnic shock. An example of a polymeric material system that resisted reaction to these mechanisms were halogenated composites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Applications include liquid oxygen for future launch vehicles, such as the Lockheed Martin Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV). They could also potentially be used in other aerospace applications, including but not limited to, RFP (rocket fuel propellant) tanks and crew vehicle cabins. Other industries that may be interested in composite oxygen tanks include the air handling and medical industries. The ability to resist ignition may also be useful in chemical storage tanks and NGV (natural gas vehicle) tanks. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A fiber-reinforced composite is defined as a material consisting of fibers of high strength and modulus embedded in or bonded to a matrix with distinct interfaces or boundaries between them. In this form, both fibers and matrix retain their physical and chemical identities, yet they produce a combination of properties that cannot be produced by either constituent alone. In general, fibers are the principal load carrying members, while the surrounding matrix keeps them in desired location and orientation, transfers loads between fibers, and protects the fibers. The matrix material may be a polymer, a metal, or a ceramic. This patent focuses on polymer matrix composites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The fibers can be made from a variety of materials. These materials include glass, graphite or carbon, polymers, boron, ceramics, or metals. Glass fibers include E-glass (electrical) and S-glass (structural) types. Carbon fibers include those made from different precursors, such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN) or pitch. Polymer fibers include, but are not limited to, aramid (Kevlar&reg;), polyethylene (Spectra&reg;), or PBO (Zylon&reg;). Ceramic fibers may include silicon carbide (SiC) or aluminum oxide (A1203). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> For cryogenic tanks, the preferred matrix material is a polymer. The preferred fiber is carbon fiber, more preferably PAN-based fibers, more preferably high strength (over 500 ksi) and high modulus (over 30 Msi) fibers. The most preferred fibers are ultra high modulus fibers (over 60 Msi), specifically M55J fiber by Toray. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Another critical parameter for a composite tank is the ability to withstand repeated temperature changes (thermal cycles) without microcracking. One factor that contributes to microcrack resistance is toughness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The unique, nontraditional concept explored herein is to use halogenated fiber-reinforced composites to create liquid oxygen tanks. A halogenated material is one which contains one or more elements from the halogen family (column 7A in the Periodic Table of Elements) in its chemical structure. Halogens of particular interest include bromine, chlorine, and fluorine. These elements form chemically stable bonds which enhances a material&apos;s ability to be flame resistant and compatible with oxygen and other reactive fuels. A composite material may be halogenated by incorporating halogens various stages of the fabrication process including the neat resin formulation, prepreg processing, and/or cure. A more complete definition of these processes in described in the section titled &Ograve;Detailed Description&Oacute;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Several halogenated resins and composites have been subjected to an extensive battery of tests for their sensitivity to reaction in the presence of oxygen. Historically, the approach was to test the material in the standard mechanical impact test in liquid oxygen (LOX). If the material had an impact threshold of 72 foot-pounds, it was acceptable for use in oxygen environments, such as launch vehicle LOX tanks. If the material&apos;s threshold was less than 72 foot-pounds, it typically was not used. Due to limitations in the testing as well as differences in the material structures between metals and composites, standard high strength composite materials typically have not been able to pass at this level when tested at RLV tank wall thicknesses. The approach taken here, which was developed in conjunction with NASA, was to use the standard mechanical impact test to rank composites with respect to each other. Furthermore, an evaluation of the compatibility of composites in oxygen environments would only be determined after testing composite materials with respect to specific ignition mechanisms while in the presence of oxygen. The ignition mechanisms tested included pressurized mechanical impact, particle impact, puncture, puncture of damaged, oxygen-soaked samples, electrostatic discharge, friction, and pyrotechnic shock. If the material could withstand ignition in these environments, it could possibly be considered oxygen compatible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Halogenated materials which have been evaluated in the standard mechanical impact test include brominated epoxy resin and composite systems as well as a fluorinated resin and composite system. In addition to these candidates, which contained halogens incorporated into the chemical structure of the resin before composite fabrication, a halogenation treatment was applied to already-cured composites and uncured preimpregnated fibers. Specifically, a graphite/epoxy system was treated in a fluorine gas chamber in both uncured prepreg and cured composite states. Many of these halogenated materials were tested in both neat resin and fiber-reinforced composite forms. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows selected results for neat resins while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows selected composite materials. Clearly, the halogenated materials outperformed the epoxy material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> One halogenated material was also tested in each of the ignition mechanisms listed above. In each case, the materials did not react. In addition, this material was tested in a Promoted Combustion test. In this test, the composite material was deliberately ignited using a special igniter material. The time it took to completely burn in a 100% oxygen atmosphere was then measured. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the average complete bum times for 10 samples compared with the average of 10 samples of the leading epoxy candidate. This test indicated the halogenated material took significantly longer than the standard epoxy to burn, indicating another level of safety over conventional composite materials. It is believed that other halogenated materials would behave similarly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The apparatus of the present invention solves the problems confronted in the art in a simple and straightforward manner. What is provided are composite tanks for liquid oxygen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The composite tanks can be made in accordance with any of the methods disclosed in any reference incorporated herein by reference. The invention could be made, for example, using the method of U.S. Pat. No. 5,403,537. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The interior of the tanks disclosed herein typically have a volume of at least 1 liter, more often at least one gallon, and usually have a volume sufficient to allow their use to contain liquid oxygen for typical aerospace applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A mechanical impact of at least 10&plus; ft-lbs at around &minus;300 degrees F. (at around &minus;350 degrees F. when densified oxygen (slush oxygen) is contained in the tank) is preferred, but is not a requirement. Historically materials have been required to pass the Lox mechanical impact test at 72 ft-lbs or otherwise be shown to be safe for use in application. Lox compatible composite materials have demonstrated the ability to resist combustion when subjected to any potential ignition source. For a composite tank, realistic potential ignition sources were determined to include, but are not limited to mechanisms such as pyrotechnic shock, friction, puncture, electrostatic discharge, and particle impact. These tests are taken to extreme levels. For example, in the puncture test, a sharpened serrated spike pierced a composite material while submerged in Lox without igniting the composite. This same puncture test has ignited Titanium, a material that is not oxygen compatible, and does not ignite aluminum. The pyrotechnic shock test was also an extreme test in that composites were placed in Lox and subjected to shock loads equivalent to existing metallic Lox tanks such as that on the External Tank. The friction test was extreme in that the composites were abraded to dust with a drill bit in pure oxygen without ignition. In the electrostatic discharge test, composites were subjected to energies that could far exceed any instrumentation or static build up; specifically, these composites do not ignite when subjected to 112.5 Joules from 5000 Volts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The composite feedline of the present invention preferably has an inner diameter of around 1&Prime; to 36&Prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;form of fiber&rdquo; means uni-directional tape, slit tape, tow, fabric, woven fabric, chopped fiber, or felt.</paragraph>

An example of an ogive tank <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is the external Tank LO2 tank. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> depicts a sketch of this concept. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Any of the tanks of FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may also be part of a winged body vehicle <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> or a cylindrical stage <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</cross-reference>, respectively. Winged body vehicles <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> can be generally cylindrically shaped, with wings on the sides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A composite LO2 may be part of a single stage to orbit vehicle or a multiple stage to orbit vehicle where a multiple stage to orbit vehicle is composed of at least 2 stages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A cylindrical tank is one that has a basic body as a cylinder <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Domes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be facing outward as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, but may also be internal or flat bulkheads capping off a cylinder. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, a cylindrical tank <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown having a general configuration that includes a cylindrically shaped side wall <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and conically shaped dome end portions <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the tank apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in a multi-lobe tank configuration. A multi-lobe tank <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> will have at least 2 lobes as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A multi-lobe tank may also have more than 2 lobes, but typically no more than 5 lobes. A multi-lobe Lox tank <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> may have one lobe with Lox and the other lobe or lobes may contain other propellants such as LH2. In FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, two tank lobes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are shown. However, it should be understood that though there are a minimum of two lobes in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, there may be more lobes for forming tank <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference>, a conformal tank <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is shown mounted between beams including an upper pair of beams <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and a lower pair of beams <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the tank <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference> can be braced with additional vertically extending beams <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Each of the tanks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can have a length of for example 2-150 feet and a maximum transverse dimension of between 2 and 100 feet. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the cylindrically shaped tank provides a diameter of about 1-100 feet and an overall length of about 2-150 feet. The multi-lobe tank 29 of FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provides an overall length of between about 4 and 150 feet, a width of 3-100 feet and a height of 2-100 feet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A conformal tank <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is any tank which aims to conform or shape itself to the vehicle inner mold line. Therefore, the shape of a conformal tank <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will depend upon the vehicle body shape. FIGS. <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> show an example of a conformal tank for a lifting body type launch vehicle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A lifting body type vehicle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. The conformal tank <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference> provides an overall length of between about 4 and 150 feet, a width of between 3 and 100 feet, and a height of between about 2-50 feet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Material Details </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A composite material can be halogenated, but is not limited to, the following or combinations of the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> 1). The first basic approach is to integrate halogen elements into the chemical structure of the resin. Halogens may be integrated into the structure of the neat resin by any of the following methods: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> a). Mixing a halogenated fluid into a non-halogenated fluid in which the two liquids become one homogeneous mixture. An example of this would be the mixture of a fluid containing bromine into an otherwise conventional epoxy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> b). Mixing a halogenated fluid into a non-halogenated fluid in which the two liquids remain somewhat separate; therefore, the resulting mixture is not homogeneous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> c). Mixing halogen solids or pellets, such as Teflon (fluorine containing) microballs, into a liquid resin which results in a 2 phase mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> d). Mixing halogen solids or pellets, into the resin, and subsequently adding heat to the mixture and blending it into a more homogeneous liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> 2). A second approach to halogenate a composite material is to incorporate halogens into the pre-preg process. Prepreg is defined as a material consisting of uncured resin impregnated on fibers. Halogenation of prepregs can be accomplished by any of the following methods: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> a). Exposure of a prepreg to halogen gas or gaseous mixture containing halogens. Exposure may occur at typical ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions or may occur at elevated temperatures and/or elevated pressures. The resulting product is halogenated prepreg. This process may take place before or after the prepreg has been placed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> b). Exposure of a prepreg to halogen particles via a charged fluidized bed. In this method, a continuous pre-preg tow or pre-preg roving, is pulled through a bed of charged halogen particles which are excited and thus adhere to grounded prepreg tow or roving. Likewise, a pre-preg fabric or uni-tape may be subjected to a bed of charged halogen particles so that the charged halogen particles become attracted to and adhere to the prepreg fabric. The resulting product is halogenated prepreg. This process would typically take place prior to placement of the prepreg material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> c). Exposure of plain fiber to halogen particles via a charged fluidized bed. In this method, a continuous fiber tow or roving, is pulled through a bed of charged halogen particles which are excited and thus adhere to grounded fiber tow or roving. Likewise, a dry fiber fabric, woven or unidirectional, may be subjected to a bed of charged halogen particles so that the charged halogen particles become attracted to and adhere to the prepreg fabric. The resulting product is halogenated prepreg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> d). Prepreging fiber with a halogenated resin in which the resin meets any of the description in 1). The method of prepreging may be, but is not limited to, hot melt or solution. An example of this is graphite impregnated with resins such as Bryte&Otilde;s 1522 resins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> 3). A third approach to halogenate a composite material is to incorporate halogens after the composite material has been cured. In this method, a cured composite is exposed to halogen gas or gaseous mixture containing halogens, such as fluorine. Exposure may occur at elevated temperatures and/or atmospheric pressure conditions or may occur at elevated temperatures and/or elevated pressures. The resulting material has a modified surface chemistry. An example of a type of modified chemistry is the replacement less stable hydrogen bonds with more stable fluorine bonds. (This is the same process described in 2a with the exception that in 2a, the material is the uncured prepreg. In the method described here, the material has already been cured). An example of this is the fluorination process by Fluorodynamics in which cured graphite-epoxy was subjected to a mixture of fluourine in GN<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at a slightly elevated temperatures in an oven for a predetermined amount of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Manufacturing Detail Examples </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> A halogenated composite tank or feedline can be fabricated using either of the uncured composite systems, any appropriate placement method, and any curing process. A listing of each of these systems, placement methods, and curing methods is found below. The best system to use depends on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, tank size and shape, composite material used, and available resources. Therefore, a decision on the best fabrication process must be made on a case-related basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A) Composite Tanks from Halogenated Prepregs or Resins </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Uncured Composite Systems: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Prepreg Systems (as described in Material Details, Section 2) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Wet Systems (as described in Material Details, Section 1) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A prepreg consists of reinforcement, such as graphite, glass, or Kevlar&reg;, which is impregnated with a resin, in this case with a halogenated. An example of a halogenated prepreg is fiber impregnated with any of Hexcel&Otilde;s F 155 resin series. Another example of a cyanate ester prepreg is fiber impregnated with Bryte&Otilde;s 1522 resin series. In both examples, the fiber was an intermediate modulus, high strength graphite, such as IM7. Also, in either example the fiber may be either unidirectional tape, slit tape, tow, fabric, chopped fiber, or felt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> A wet process involves working with a neat resin and dry fiber reinforcement. The dry reinforcement may be graphite, glass, or Kevlar. Any dry reinforcement may be in the form of woven fabric, unidirectional, chopped fiber, or felt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Placement Methods for Prepreg Systems (as Described in Material Details, Section 2): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Fiber Placement </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Tape Placement </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Filament Winding </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Hand Lay-up </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Fiber placement is an automated process where a robotic arm with a dispensing head is used to place several pieces of prepreg tow or slit tape, typically approximately 0.125 inches wide by 0.0055 inches thick, onto a mandrel in a desired orientation. Tape placement is a similar automated process, but the placement head is attached to a gantry rather than a robotic arm, and it places prepreg tape, typically 12 or 14 inches wide, onto the tool or mandrel. Filament winding is a process in which continuous prepreg tow is wound onto a rotating mandrel in a prescribed way. Hand lay-up is when prepreg, usually tape or fabric, is manually applied to a tool or mandrel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Placement Methods for Wet Systems (as Described in Material Details, Section 1): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) or Resin Infiltration (RI) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Filament Winding </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Hand Lay-up </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> VARTM and RI are processes where vacuum pressure is used to force wet resin into dry reinforcement, typically fabric, which is previously placed on the tool or mandrel. Filament winding is the same as above, only a dry tow is run through a resin bath prior to placement on the tank rather than using prepreg tow. Hand lay-up is where resin is manually applied to dry reinforcement either before or after placing on the tool or mandrel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Curing Processes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Autoclave </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Oven Cured (with or without vacuum bag) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Radiation Cure (such as electron beam) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Curing of a composite material is the application of energy (heat or radiation) and possibly pressure to cause a chemical reaction and form a compact, solid part. The cure method may be any of the following: autoclave (elevated temperature and pressure), vacuum-bag oven cure (elevated temperature and vacuum pressure), oven cure (elevated temperature, ambient pressure), or radiation cure (typically ambient temperature and pressure with radiation, such as electron beams or x-ray radiation). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrate an example of a bagging scheme and autoclave cure, respectively, for a halogenated (brominated) epoxy prepreg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> B) Halogen Treatment of Composite Materials (as Described in Material Details Section 3) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> An oxygen compatible tank can be made by taking a cured tank made from a non-halogenated material using an appropriate system, placement technique, and curing technique described in Section A of the Manufacturing Details above. A halogenation treatment process is then performed on the cured tank. </paragraph>
