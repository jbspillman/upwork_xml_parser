<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The hearing aid system includes a hearing aid case which is designed to be positioned behind the ear of a user, a tube for conducting sound from the case to the ear canal of the user, and a eartip for anchoring the end of the tube within the ear canal of the user. The tube is formed in a preformed shape of a material with sufficient rigidity to support the hearing aid in a proper position on the user&apos;s ear. The eartip may be one of several different designs which secures an end of the tube in place in the ear canal in a comfortable manner without the need for an expensive custom made ear mold and without complete occlusion of the ear canal. A combination of the light weight and small size of the case, the rigidity of the preformed tube, and one of the eartips for anchoring the tube in the ear canal allow the system to be held in place securely without the need for either an inflexible and aesthetically unpleasing ear hook or an expensive custom made ear mold. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a behind the ear hearing aid system, and more particularly, the invention relates to a hearing aid system having an open ear canal hearing aid eartip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. State of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Present day hearing aids have been developed to correct the hearing of users having various degrees of hearing impairments. Generally, hearing loss is not uniform over the entire audio frequency range. For example, hearing loss for sounds at high audio frequencies (above approximately 1,000 Hz) will be more pronounced for some people with certain common hearing impairments, while hearing loss for sounds at lower frequencies (below approximately 1,000 Hz) will be more pronounced for people having different hearing impairments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The largest population of people having hearing impairments include those having mild hearing losses with normal or nearly normal hearing in the low frequency ranges and hearing losses in the higher frequency ranges. The most problematic sounds for people having such mild hearing losses are high frequency sounds at low amplitudes (soft, high-pitched sounds). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The traditional approach for correcting hearing impairments has been to employ either an electronic &ldquo;in the ear&rdquo; (ITE) hearing aid device inserted into the ear of the user or a &ldquo;behind the ear&rdquo; (BTE) hearing aid device attached behind the ear. The ITE hearing aid devices are custom made to fit within the ear and ear canal of the particular user. The BTE hearing aid devices include a flexible plastic tube connecting a behind the ear device to an ear mold placed within the ear. Both the ITE and BTE hearing aid devices tend to block the ear canal so that little or no sound can reach the ear in a natural, unaided manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Hearing aid systems which block the ear canal almost entirely cause a problem known as the occlusion effect. The occlusion effect is caused by the increased transmission of sound by bone conduction when the ear canal is blocked and ear conduction is impeded. This occlusion effect results in sounds which are unnatural and uncomfortable for the user. In particular, the user&apos;s voice sounds unnaturally higher than normal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Some hearing aid systems have been made employing vents in the ear mold which reduce the occlusion effect partially. These vents allow the user to hear some natural sounds through a device positioned in the ear. Although vents provide some improvement in decreasing the occlusion effect, distortion of the user&apos;s voice remains a problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In an effort to alleviate some of the aforementioned problems, some BTE hearing aids have been designed with a flexible tube that extends into the ear canal and is held in place within the ear canal by an ear mold that leaves the ear canal generally unobstructed. Although the relatively open ear canal of these devices overcomes some of the occlusion effect, these hearing aids suffer from a number of other significant problems. For example, the BTE hearing aids employ a rigid plastic ear hook to secure the BTE device on the ear. The ear hook connects a hearing aid casing positioned behind the ear to a flexible plastic tubing which extends into the ear. The relatively large and rigid ear hook and the connection between the ear hook and the flexible tubing are visible and aesthetically unpleasing. The large size and visibility of the BTE hearing aid components results in a cosmetically unattractive device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A flexible tube is used which can be cut to an appropriate length for a particular user. The ear mold which secures the end of the flexible hearing aid tube within the ear canal has to be custom manufactured to fit the user&apos;s ear to sufficiently secure the hearing aid tube in place in the ear canal and prevent the ear mold from falling out of the ear, for example, when the user is jogging. The custom made ear mold adds to the cost of the device and the time needed to fit the hearing aid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> There are some stock ear canal eartips available which are generally used during a trial period when the hearing aid is being tested or while the ear mold is being made. Some of these stock ear canal eartips are formed of hard materials, some are formed of solid rubber, and some are formed of foam. In general, stock ear canal eartips which are currently available have problems with holding the end of the flexible hearing aid tube securely in place. When these stock ear canal eartips fit tight enough to hold the tube in the ear they are usually uncomfortable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly it would be desirable to address the above-described problems with a BTE hearing aid which avoids the occlusion effect, can be used without an expensive custom made ear mold, and provides an aesthetically pleasing and comfortable device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A hearing aid system according to the present invention includes a hearing aid case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is designed to be positioned behind the ear of a user, a tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for conducting sound from the case to the ear canal of the user, and an eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for anchoring the end of the tube within the ear canal of the user. The tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed in a preformed shape of a material with sufficient rigidity to support the hearing aid in a proper position on the user&apos;s ear. The eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be one of several different designs shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> which secures an end of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in place in the ear canal in a comfortable manner without the need for an expensive custom made ear mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The system is designed to be particularly useful for those users experiencing mild to moderate hearing loss as an alternative to the known devices which may be uncomfortable, very visible, and expensive. A combination of the light weight and small size of the case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the rigidity and shape of the preformed tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the features of the eartips <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for anchoring the tube in the ear canal allow the system to be held in place securely without the need for either an aesthetically unpleasing ear hook or an expensive and large custom made ear mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a first end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is configured to be attached to the hearing aid case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is configured to be inserted into the eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a preformed shape which is shown in the views of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a hook portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> near the first end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is designed to extend from the case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, located behind the ear, over the connecting point of the ear to the head. The hook portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the tube is curved substantially in a plane as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. From the hook portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the tube continues to curve to a location where the tube bends to enter the ear canal. Just before the tube bends to enter the ear canal, a reverse bend <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is provided which allows the tube to curve through the crus of the helix and behind the tragus. A lower bend <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extends from the outside of the ear into the ear canal. The lower bend <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is located substantially in a plane which is approximately perpendicular to the plane in which the ear hook portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> lies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> A distance between a top of the hook portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a lowest part of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> where the tube bends to enter the ear canal is called the run and has a run length L<highlight><subscript>R</subscript></highlight>. A distance between the point where the tube bends to enter the ear canal and the second end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the tube is called a duck in length L<highlight><subscript>D</subscript></highlight>. The appropriate run length L<highlight><subscript>R </subscript></highlight>and duck in length L<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>will vary somewhat between users. Accordingly, a tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having the same general curvature is preferably provided in different sizes by providing two or more different run lengths L<highlight><subscript>R </subscript></highlight>and two or more duck in lengths L<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>to accommodate different users. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the run length L<highlight><subscript>R </subscript></highlight>can be varied between about 3.0 and 3.45 cm and the duck in length L<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>can be varied between about 1.4 and 1.7 cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed in the shape described above by any known preforming process, such as, heat forming or UV light forming. The tube is preferably formed by fixing a connector member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at the first end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the tube and fixing a honey dipper member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the second end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the tube. The connector member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the honey dipper member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are preferably overmolded onto the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by placing the tube into a mold which forms these end connector members. Alternatively, the connector member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and honey dipper member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be molded first and then bonded to the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. After the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed with the end members, a formed wire is positioned within the tube, thus bending the tube to the desired shape. The tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is heated to shaped it in the preformed shape which is then retained by the tube upon cooling and removal of the wire. As one example, PeBax tubing is formed at about 120&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> One method of improving the memory characteristics of the hearing aid tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the present invention is by electron beam radiation of the tube after the tube has been formed in the desired shape and heated to retain the shape. The cross linking established by the electron beam gives the tube a permanent memory of the desired shape that is maintained even in the presence of heat or long periods of deformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed with an outer diameter of about 1.0 to 1.6 mm, preferably about 1.2 mm and an inner diameter of about 0.5 to 0.9 mm, preferably about 0.7 mm. This is substantially smaller than the flexible tubing used in known hearing aids which has outer diameters of about 3.0 mm. The known tubing at about twice the size of the tubing of the present invention is very visible. Although there is a trade-off between inner tube diameter and sound level output of the tube, tubes having an inner diameter of as small as about 0.5 mm have been found to provide sufficient sound level output for hearing aids designed for mild and moderate hearing loss users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The material of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be any material which can be formed in a preformed shape and exhibits sufficient rigidity to hold the eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> within the ear canal and retains it&apos;s shape when positioned on the ear. Examples of tube materials include FEP Teflon, Nylon, PEBAX, silicone, polyurethane, PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), EVA (ethylvinylacetate), and the like. The material of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a shore hardness of about 65 to 85 Shore D, preferably about 72 Shore D. The relative rigidity of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> allows the tube to apply a torque to the eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to maintain the eartip in a position in which the eartip is pressed against an anatomical feature within the ear canal. This ability to apply a torque to the eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provides a substantial improvement over flexible tubing used in known BTE hearing aids in which the ear mold must fix the end of the tube in the ear and the tube provides no retention or support of the hearing aid device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> is a schematic view of a test used to compare the flexibility of a tube according to the present invention to a prior art tube. The tubing of the invention which was tested was a PEBAX tube having an inner diameter of 0.7 mm, an outer diameter of 1.2 mm, and a durometer of 72 Shore D. The prior art tubing tested had an inner diameter of 1.9 mm, an outer diameter of 3.0 mm, and was formed of PVC. A one inch (2.54 cm) piece of tube was tested for both the prior art and the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, the force required to bend a one inch (2.54 cm) piece of the standard PVC flexible tubing 0.1 inch (2.54 mm) is lower than the force required to bend the more rigid tubing of the present invention. Even though the improved tubing is much thinner and hence, substantially more cosmetically attractive, it is also substantially stiffer. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, the force required to deflect the improved tube is about 1.4 to 2.1 g which is two or three times higher than the force required to deflect the standard hearing aid tubing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The hearing aid case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> is sized to fit behind the user&apos;s ear. The case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a curved lower end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and an attachment end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for connection to the connector member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the tube. The case has an overall length which is less than about 2.5 cm, compared to standard BTE devices with overall lengths of about 3.05 to 4.3 cm. One example of a hearing aid case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the present invention has dimensions of approximately 2.16 cm&times;0.81 cm&times;0.61 cm. Typically, the hearing aid case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including electronics and a battery has a weight of about 1.25 g compared to known BTE devices having weights of about 2.7 to 4.4 g. The small size and light weight of the case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> allows the case to be held behind the ear by the small preformed tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> without the need for an inflexible and aesthetically unattractive ear hook and the large custom eartips used in known BTE systems. The case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a microphone <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> at the attachment end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a battery compartment door <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at the lower end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The attachment end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a nipple <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> through which sound is conducted from a speaker inside the case into the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The nipple <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes an annular retention ring <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which allows the connector member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the tube to snap onto the nipple. The attachment end also includes a rectangular key member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which corresponds with a keyway <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the connector member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to insure that a proper orientation between the case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is achieved when the tube is snapped onto the case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> encloses the electronic components including a microphone, a processor unit, and a speaker for delivering amplified sounds to the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. One example of a system for amplification of sounds includes a compressor which adjusts the gain as a function of an amplitude level detected, and is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/781,714 which was filed Jan. 10, 1997 and is incorporated herein by reference. According to the present invention, multiple hearing aid cases may be provided with processors having different frequency responses for use by users having different hearing losses. Further, the cases may be provided in a plurality of colors for aesthetic or color coding purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The connector member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the honey dipper member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are illustrated in further detail in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The connector member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> includes a bore <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which is received on the nipple <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The bore <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes an internal recess which corresponds to the retention ring <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> on the nipple providing the snap fit. The connector member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> also includes a keyway <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which is shaped to be received on the key <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the case as the tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is attached to the case to achieve a proper orientation of the tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The honey dipper member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a cylindrical member having three annular ribs <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The ribs <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> each have an angled or tapered forward surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which assists in inserting the honey dipper member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into one of the eartips <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The connector member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the honey dipper member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are preferably formed of a material which is flexible enough to slide over the retention ring <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> but rigid enough to hold the tube securely once in place. Materials having durometers of about 25 to 60 Shore D, preferably about 40 Shore D provide the desired flexibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> is a side cross sectional view of an alternative embodiment of a tube with a honey dipper member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The honey dipper member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>includes an elongated sleeve <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> extending over the second end <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> has an enlarged cylindrical shoulder <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> spaced from the ribs <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the honey dipper member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> provides the multiple functions of (1) stiffening the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to make installing the eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and inserting the tube into the ear canal easier; (2) providing a visual indication of correct placement of the eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; (3) providing a surface to grasp when installing the eartip; and (4) providing a surface to engage with the finger to push the eartip into the ear canal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The shoulder <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> has a first surface <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which abuts the eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when the eartip is fully installed on the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This visual and tactile indication of proper positioning of the eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> guides the user in proper installation. Improper installation of the eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may result in the eartip becoming separated from the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the ear canal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The shoulder <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> also has a second surface <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, opposite the first surface <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, which gives the user something to grasp when installing the eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and allows the user to push the eartip and tube into the ear by engaging the second surface with the finger tip or fingernail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The sleeve <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> extends a distance of about 1.2 to 1.5 cm, preferably about 1.27 cm along the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This distance is generally less than or equal to the duck in length L<highlight><subscript>D </subscript></highlight>of the tube. The sleeve <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is preferably formed of the same or a similar material and color as the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to maintain cosmetics. However, during use, the sleeve <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> will generally be hidden within the ear and the ear canal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The eartips <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for connection to the honey dipper member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are described below with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> A bud-shaped hearing aid eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. The bud-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a conically shaped member having a through bore for sound transmission and an interior socket configured to allow the bud-shaped eartip to be received on the honey dipper end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the bud-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>functions by &ldquo;hooking&rdquo; up under the roof or superior surface of the ear canal. The stiffness of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> holds the bud-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in this position. The bud-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is particularly suited for users having an upward slanting ear canal or a narrow section of the ear canal roof in which the bud-shaped eartip grabs well. The bud-shaped eartip according to one embodiment of the invention has an overall length of about 6.3 mm and a diameter at a widest part of about 5.6 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> illustrate a flower-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>including a central core <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and three flower petals <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> extending from the central core. Each of the petals <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> has a substantially ellipsoidal shaped end <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Most people have a first bend B in the ear canal that allows one or more of the petals <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to extend behind the bend and grab the ear canal behind the bend to retain the flower-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the ear canal. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, an anterior petal <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>applies a gentle force which keeps the posterior blades <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>behind the first bend B. The flower-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may include a plurality of grooves <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> extending radially outward from a through bore <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> at the posterior end of the eartip. These grooves <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> provide more area for the sound to exit the eartip but due to their narrow dimension prevent wax entrance. The grooves <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> also make it easier for wax to be removed from the through bore <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> if it does enter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a cross sectional view of the flower-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>illustrating the through bore <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and interior socket <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for receiving the honey dipper member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The interior socket <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is configured with internal circular grooves <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to accommodate the ribs <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the honey dipper member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Another variation of the flower eartip is the webbed flower eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> in which the flower petals <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are connected by a thin web <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of eartip material. The webbed flower eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>will reduce the ambient sound passage through the ear canal increasing occlusion. The increased occlusion provided by the webbed flower eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>may be desirable for some users in order to increase the gain in the 1 to 2 kHz frequency range or to reduce the occurrence of feedback oscillation. The webbed flower eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>will also provide added retention by the contact between the web <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and the ear canal surfaces. The webbed flower eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and flower-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may have an overall length of about 6.8 mm and a length from a center of the core to an end of a petal of about 5.4 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A fourth eartip design is the guppie-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of FIGS. <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which includes a central body portion <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and a tail <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. As seen in the top view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> the tail <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is a rounded petal shaped member. The tail <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> hooks behind the tragus T of the ear canal as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> to provide retention in the ear canal of a user. The tail <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> has a soft spoon shaped surface which is pressed gently against the surface under the tragus T. Again, the stiffness of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> keeps the guppie-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>properly oriented and positioned within the ear canal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> A fifth eartip design shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</cross-reference> is the barb-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>including a central body portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and a barb <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> extending from the central body portion. The barb-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is somewhat less occluding than the guppie-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and operates in substantially the same manner as the guppie-shaped eartip. The guppie or barb-shaped eartips according to one embodiment may have an overall length of about 14.0 mm and a diameter at a widest part of about 5.6 mm. However, the dimensions which have been described are merely examples of the eartip dimensions which may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A further eartip design shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is a dome-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>having a bud-shaped core <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and a skirt <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> starting about half way down the bud-shape and extending from the core. The dome-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>has an interior socket <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for receiving the honey dipper member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a through bore <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for sound delivery. A U-shaped groove <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extends across the core <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and intersects the through bore <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The U-shaped groove <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a second groove <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>increase the cross sectional area through which sound exits the eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and provide four vent holes <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> through the eartip beneath the skirt <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The vent holes <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> allow sound to pass through the eartip. These vent holes may be omitted in an occluding version of the eartip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The dome-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>also includes a wax guard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in the form of an integral bridge member which extends substantially perpendicular to the U-shaped groove <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The wax guard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is an arch shaped member which serves as a barrier for direct entry of wax into the through bore <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Although the preferred embodiment of the dome-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>includes the wax guard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the eartip may also be formed without a wax guard, with a wax flap as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</cross-reference>, or with any of the wax guards which are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The dome-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>may be provided in different sizes with varying size skirts <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>functions similar to the guppie-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>or flower-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with the skirt <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> grabbing under the tragus or around the first bend in the ear canal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A final eartip design shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</cross-reference> is a bud-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>having a wax flap <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>includes three grooves <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> forming a T-shape which is centered on the sound delivery bore of the eartip. The wax flap <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> extends over the sound delivery bore and prevents direct entry of wax into the bore which may cause occlusion of the eartip. The flap <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is flexible enough to be pushed down when inserting the eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>but will spring back up. Sound can exit around the flap <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> through the grooves <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the eartip even when the flap is pushed down. The wax flap <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or the wax guard <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be incorporated in any of the eartips <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which have been described above to improve operation of the hearing aid system by preventing wax blockage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The plurality of different eartip shapes are provided because the shape of the ear canal and sensitivity differs from one user to another. For example, some users seem to be more sensitive to pressure in an area behind the first bend in the ear canal. For these users the guppie-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>may be most comfortable because it does not contact this area. In addition, eartips may be provided in different sizes to accommodate differences in the anatomy of users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The eartips <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed of a resilient material which is clear or darkly colored to be less visible. The eartip material may be a soft elastomer, such as silicone rubber or other soft plastic. The eartip material preferably has a durometer of about 30 Shore A. Alternatively, the eartips <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be formed of a foam material. In particular, foam eartips may be used to provide a significant blockage of the ear canal for users needing high gains where other eartips do not provide enough occlusion of the canal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> illustrates the insertion of the honey dipper member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into the flower-shaped eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with the assistance of an insertion tool <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Due to the small size of both the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the eartips <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the resilience of the eartips it may be difficult for some people to manually insert the tube into the eartip when assembling the hearing aid. The insertion tool <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is an elongated rod having a longitudinal slit <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> extending in a longitudinal direction along the rod from an end surface <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The slit <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> has a rounded bottom surface and is sized to accommodate a portion of the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> adjacent the honey dipper member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The insertion tool <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> assists in inserting the tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into the eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by placing a portion of the tube into the longitudinal slit <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the rod until the end surface <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the tool abuts the honey dipper portion <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is stabilized by the insertion tool <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> by grasping the tool and tube together during installation of the eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The hearing aid system which has been described above provides significant advantages in user comfort and aesthetics over known systems. A combination of the light weight case <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the relatively rigid and smaller shaped tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the comfortable eartip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provide a secure and comfortable fit. The small transparent preformed tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is substantially more discrete than the ear hook and tube combination used in the known system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made an equivalents employed, without departing from the present invention. </paragraph>
