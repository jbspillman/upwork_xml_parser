<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to printed matter, including banknotes, security documents and devices, and all other printed matter. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The printing industry is constantly looking for printing techniques which produce printed matter which offers additional security or which is visually appealing in various applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the security printing industry, printed matter which exhibits an effect when visually inspected under various light conditions, but which is not capable of replication using known duplicating methods, such as photocopying or scanning, is highly advantageous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A security document having some of these features is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,420,515&mdash;Amon et al, which includes a metallic film which is printed or embossed to produce a latent image which is viewed to verify the authenticity of the document. However, the process by which this document is produced requires a number of complex steps to apply the metallic film to the substrate before printing and embossing, and since it would be impractical to incorporate these application steps in the usual document printing process, difficulties will be experienced in making the process commercially attractive. Furthermore, the image produced by the printing and embossing of the metallic film is a latent image which may require specific conditions for viewing and verification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The introduction of banknotes printed on polymer substrates has introduced a further dimension to the security printing industry, and the present invention seeks to provide a further improvement in banknotes and other security devices exhibiting the abovementioned desirable effect. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The invention provides a printed document or other device comprising a substrate having a surface to which printed matter is applied, a reflective or brightly coloured layer applied directly to said surface as part of a printing process without embossing the layer, and a raised printed image applied to said reflective or brightly coloured layer by a printing process, at least part of said raised printed image having a height of at least 5 &mgr;m and being visible from all angles of the document, said raised printed image being enhanced by said reflective or brightly coloured layer when viewed at different angles and under different lighting conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> By applying a raised printed image on a reflective or brightly coloured layer, the colour of the printed image is intensified and becomes brighter and is thus enhanced, and an optically variable image is produced when the document is viewed under different lighting conditions or at different viewing angles thereby introducing an optically variable effect of benefit in security applications. Since the reflective or brightly coloured layer is printed on said substrate, or is applied as part of a printing process, it is conveniently incorporated into the printing process to overcome the production shortcomings of the process described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,420,515. Furthermore, the effect of the reflective or brightly coloured layer is to enhance the visible image produced by the raised printed regions, rather than to produce a latent image as in the U.S. Patent The enhanced image is able to be directly viewed and does not require special lighting or other conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The raised printed image is most conveniently produced by an intaglio printing process, although acceptable raised images may be produced by other known printing processes or by a combination of embossing and printing on raised embossed surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The enhanced image effect referred to above is not achieved if the image is printed using the normal offset printing process, and unless the height of the raised print is at least 5 &mgr;m, the enhancement produced by the underlying reflective or brightly coloured layer may be insufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In one form of the invention, the substrate is a polymer film and preferably a laminated film of the type used in the production of Australian banknotes. Alternatively, the substrate can be a paper substrate provided it has a smooth surface on which the reflective or brightly coloured layer is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In certain applications or areas of the document, the reflective or brightly coloured layer can be applied directly to the substrate or film, which can have its own reflective effect, thereby intensifying the reflective properties of the reflective or brightly coloured layer. In other applications, an opaque ink layer may be first applied to the surface of the substrate and the reflective or brightly coloured layer applied to the opaque layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Both the reflective or brightly coloured layer and the opaque layer are preferably applied to the substrate by the Gravure printing process, although the reflective or brightly coloured layer may comprise a metallised foil or a brightly coloured foil which is laminated or adhesively applied to the surface of the substrate as part of the printing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides a method of producing a printed document or other device on a substrate, comprising the step of applying a reflective or brightly coloured layer directly to the substrate as part of a printing process, followed by the step of applying a raised image to the reflective or brightly coloured layer by a printing process so that at least part of said raised image has a height of at least 5&mgr; and is visible from all angles of the document. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In one form of the invention, the reflective or brightly coloured layer is an ink layer applied by the Gravure printing process and the raised print is produced by an intaglio printing process. Alternatively, the reflective or brightly coloured layer comprises a reflective or brightly coloured foil which is laminated or adhesively applied to the surface of the substrate as part of the printing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred form of the invention, the reflective or brightly coloured layer is applied to an opaque layer which has been applied to the substrate.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In a presently preferred form of the invention, a thin polymer substrate comprising laminated polypropylene sheets of the type currently used to produce Australian polymer banknotes firstly has an opaque layer applied to both sides of the substrate by the Gravure printing process, following which a reflective or brightly coloured layer of ink is applied also by the Gravure process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The ink can comprise any suitable ink which produces a reflective or brightly coloured effect. Suitable inks include the following pigments blended at a 30% to 70% w/w concentration in clear varnish suitable for Gravure application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Product Description: Flake oxidation resistant metal powder based on a copper-zinc-alloy. (ca 85% Cu, 15% Zn) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Particle Size: &lt;45 &mgr;m </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Product Manufacturer: ECKART-WERKE GmbH &amp; Co and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Product Name: Aluminium Powder Super Lining GGT </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Product Description: Aluminium Powder (Aluminium based on H-Al 99,5%) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Manufacturer as above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Printed matter is then applied to the surface of the reflective or brightly coloured layer by the intaglio process to produce a print having raised regions having a height of at least 5 &mgr;m. The maximum height of the raised region will be determined by the intaglio or other printing/embossing process, but enhanced effects have been observed with raised regions of about 50 &mgr;m in height. In the present example, the intaglio print can comprise the same prints which are currently applied to Australian polymer banknotes, and these prints are significantly enhanced by the reflective or brightly coloured background and an optically variable image is produced when the intaglio print is viewed under different lighting conditions and viewing angles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Most printed images will have regions in which substantially parallel lines of raised ink are present. When these lines are viewed at an angle other than directly above the lines, significant enhancement of the image is produced by the reflective or brightly coloured layer. Of course, even if there are no parallel lines, some enhancement of the image is still produced by the underlying reflective or brightly coloured layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The reflective effect of the reflective or brightly coloured layer complements the image applied by the intaglio process since the intaglio process transfers a raised print to the substrate, and when such a print is applied to the reflective surface, a novel effect is achieved. An image can be observed by viewing the intaglio image at different angles. If the same intaglio image is printed on a nonreflective substrate, the same effect will not be achieved. The novel image effect may be explained by the following factors: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> When the raised intaglio print is viewed at a specific angle the walls of the intaglio lines hide the background print. The reflective or brightly coloured nature of the substrate intensifies the distinction between the intaglio and reflective substrate revealing and enhancing the raised image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The flat/smooth nature of polymer substrate enhanced by a reflective or brightly coloured printed surface, in addition to the raised surface of the intaglio image intensifies both of these properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the reflective or brightly coloured ink can be applied directly to the surface of the polymer substrate since the substrate has its own reflective effect, and this intensifies the reflective effect produced by the reflective or brightly coloured ink layer. If the reflective or brightly coloured ink is applied without an opaque layer, the image will still provide a beneficial effect. Alternatively, if the reflective or brightly coloured ink layer is applied in a region which has been printed on the other side, the printed image will still be enhanced by the underlying reflective layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the reflective ink layer can be replaced by a reflective foil or other film which is laminated or adhesively applied to the substrate and a similar effect is achieved in either case. Suitable reflective foils include those that are applied onto the substrate by hot stamping techniques. These foils typically comprise of a carrier film, a release layer, a metallised layer and an adhesive. Application of the foils is achieved by the hot stamping technique where the foil is adhered onto the substrate at a temperature of, but not limited to, 130&deg; C. and high compressive pressure, so that the adhesive is activated and the carrier film is released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> By applying an intaglio print to a reflective or brightly coloured substrate, the security features of the intaglio image are substantially enhanced, resulting in greater distinction of a security image. Both the optically variable intaglio effect and the reflective/glossy nature of the substrate are difficult to replicate by standard duplicating methods, such as colour photocopying or scanning, and the effect produced is aesthetically pleasing. </paragraph>
