<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to nucleic acid amplification with subsequent hybridization on solid supports (gene chip on glass support) as its application. More specifically, it relates to novel nucleic acid probes for detecting human hepatitis B virus surface antigen mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine) in serum samples. Throughout this invention, various publications are referenced by Arabic numerals. The disclosure of these publications is hereby incorporated by reference into this application to describe more fully the art to which this invention pertains. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns the specific detection from serum samples of human hepatitis B virus surface antigen mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine), by polymerase chain reaction, using novel nucleic acid probes. The present invention could be applied to detection of such mutant by other means, in particular detection of differential fluorescent signals after hybridization of unknown human viral DNA samples with a specific nucleic acid probe that is immobilized on solid supports (i.e. glass). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Viral hepatitis is a systemic disease involving primarily the liver, with hepatitis B virus being mainly responsible for most cases of acute or chronic hepatitis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Antigenic characterization of human hepatitis B virus derives from the complex protein found on the virus&apos; surface, namely hepatitis B virus surface antigen. The major antigenic epitope, designated as &lsquo;a&rsquo; and located from amino acid 124 to 147 of the hepatitis B virus surface antigen, is common to all hepatitis B virus. This &lsquo;a&rsquo; epitope is directly involved in inducing neutralizing antibodies against hepatitis B viral infection. Such induction can be achieved by immunizing individuals with commercial available vaccines, consisting of non-infectious subviral hepatitis B surface antigen particles. An acquired protection in humans against hepatitis B viral infection is generally indicated by the presence of an adequate amount of serum antibody to hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBs). There is also a concomitant decrease of the serum viral surface antigen. However, an increasing numbers of incidence of hepatitis B viral infection despite the serum anti-HBs have been reported. These are largely contributed by hepatitis B viral strains that carry mutations on the antigenic region of the viral surface antigen, and in particular on the &lsquo;a&rsquo; epitope. Such surface antigen mutants are of serious concern as they display reduced affinity for the neutralizing antibodies and able to replicate independently. The most common mutation among these vaccine-escape hepatitis B virus variants has been found at amino acid residue 145 (Glycine to Arginine) on the &lsquo;a&rsquo; epitope of the viral surface antigen. In immunized infants born to HBeAg positive mothers, for example, the mutation 145 (Glycine to Arginine) within the major hydrophilic region is the most common variant found in those who subsequently become infected despite adequate amount of protective anti-HBs antibodies. This particular mutant is also the most common variant found in orthotopic liver transplantation patients who succumbed to hepatitis B viral infection despite immunoprophylaxis using hepatitis B immunoglobulin. Significantly, this human hepatitis B virus surface antigen mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine) is also a naturally occurring variant that has been detected worldwide. In Singapore, despite the fact that an active vaccination program has resulted in a significant decrease of acute hepatitis B infection and the incidence of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in the general population, cases of breakthrough viral infection have been detected. Many of them (twelve out of forty-one) carry the viral surface antigen mutation 145 (Glycine to Arginine). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The emergence of this replicative hepatitis B virus surface antigen mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine) and its ability to escape detection using currently available reagents are of grave concern, because this mutant is infectious and has resulted in the development of acute hepatitis B in Europe as well as Singapore. Our latest data also point to an increasing incidence of quasispecies in Singapore population consisting of both wild type and surface antigen 145 (Glycine to Arginine) of hepatitis B virus. Although serum human hepatitis B viral DNA can be detected by standard liquid hybridization assay (Abbott Laboratories, U.S.A.), such commercial kits are not designed to distinguish wild type hepatitis B virus from variants carrying mutations on hepatitis B surface antigen. A rapid and simple detection method for this particular human hepatitis B virus surface antigen mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine) would therefore be useful for its diagnosis, therapy and prevention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One approach toward this goal would be to detect the specific nucleic acid sequence of the HBsAg mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine) in serum samples by specific Polymerase Chain Reaction amplification. Specific oligonucleotides would need to be designed on the basis of various available HBsAg sequences. Current methods of nucleic acid and oligonucleotide identifications have problems of sensitivity and selectivity, and have disadvantages such as the tedious and cumbersome analysis of the amplification results requiring highly skill operators to carry out the analyses i.e. agarose gel, polyacrylamide gel and molecular cloning. Application by the sophisticated oligonucleotide-based chip (Gene Chip) technology can provide further improved accuracy and rapid diagnostic screening assay. Gene Chip technology is now making more efficient and easier to use tools possible for obtaining and evaluating genetic information. This technology can be used for a broad spectrum of applications and analysis, such as sequence analysis, genotyping and monitoring of gene expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> First developed in the late 1980s as a concept to determining DNA sequence by hybridization, the Gene Chip technology has been used in various fields of medicine and pharmaceutical research. Usually immobilized on solid support such as glass, the probe sequences can be originated from different procedures. These include the photolithographic synthesis of 20-25-mer oligonucleotides onto silicon wafers (Affymetrix, Glaxo-Welcome), printing of 500-5000 nucleotide cDNAs onto glass chip or dotting of pre-synthesized specific oligonucleotides (via their chemically modified terminus) onto glass chip. For the purpose of detecting hepatitis B surface antigen mutants with high specificity, the limited number of possible mutation sites (amino acid 100-160) would favor the dotting of pre-made oligonucleotides onto glass support in the application of Gene Chip technology. A specific detection system for hepatitis B surface antigen Glycine-145-Arginine mutant has been developed and described in this disclosure. It is based on novel nucleic acid probes which constitute an important innovative step towards the goals mentioned. Their identification would contribute to the effective prevention and control of hepatitis B viral infection arising from these viral surface antigen mutants, through rapid screening in blood banks, commercial and research diagnostic laboratories. This know-how information can also be used to detect other hepatitis B mutants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The specific detection system described in the present invention that is based on novel nucleic acid probes constitutes an important step towards these goals and should contribute to the effective control of hepatitis B viral infection arising from these viral surface antigen mutants. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This invention describes novel nucleic acid probes that can be used in polymerase chain reaction to amplify specifically human hepatitis B surface antigen mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine) from serum samples. In contrast to commercial liquid hybridization assays, the detection system in the present invention is able to detect the said human hepatitis B viral mutant from serum samples with specificity. The specificity of the present invention in turn allows detection of such mutant using gene chip technology, wherein the specific fluorescent labeled nucleic acid probe is immobilized on solid glass supports prior to hybridization reaction with target viral DNA fragment labeled by different fluorescent dye, and amplified from serum samples. The specific detection of this infectious human vaccine-escape hepatitis B surface antigen mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine), from quasispecies serum samples, provides useful information for future monitoring of such mutants using specific therapeutic vaccines and effective antiviral agents. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> This invention provides a method for detecting specifically from serum samples the human hepatitis B virus surface antigen mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine), by polymerase chain reaction. Direct application of this detection system includes the detection of human hepatitis B virus surface antigen mutant <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> (Glycine to Arginine) by detecting differential fluorescent signals, following hybridization of human hepatitis viral DNA with novel nucleic acid probes immobilized on solid glass supports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The subject matter of the present invention is the development of a simple, sensitive method to detect human hepatitis B virus surface antigen mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine) from serum samples. As a direct application, detection of this particular mutant could be achieved by detecting differential fluorescent signals after hybridization of the novel nucleic acid probes immobilized on solid glass supports and target viral DNA sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention consists of the design of novel oligonucleotides that can be used in polymerase chain reaction, to specifically amplify the human hepatitis B virus surface antigen mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine). A set of synthetic oligonucleotides useful as amplifier probes, comprise at least two different oligonucleotides probes, wherein each oligonucleotide probe consisting of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> 1. first oligonucleotide having 14 nucleotides (5&prime;-TACGGACAGAAACT-3&prime;, position 582 to 595 as referred to the wild type human hepatitis B virus genome) which contains the mutation G to A, leading to change at amino acid 145 of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (Glycine to Arginine), at position 8 of the oligonucleotide; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> 2. second oligonucleotide having 21 nucleotides (5&prime;-TTAGGGTTTAAATCTATACCC-3&prime;, position 842 to 822 as referred to the wild type human hepatitis B virus genome), which is complementary to the coding strand of hepatitis B virus surface antigen </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Further subject matters of the present invention include reagents for implementing the method, namely the viral DNA extraction from human serum samples, the polymerase chain reaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> One of the applications of the present invention is the detection of the human hepatitis B virus surface antigen mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine) using a solid glass supports device. In the present invention, further modifications have been added to two oligonucleotides (listed in claim 5): 5&prime;-TACGGACGGAAACT-3&prime;, and 5&prime;-TACGGACAGAAACT-3&prime;, both located from position 582 to 595 as referred to the wild type human hepatitis B virus genome. These modifications include a fluorescent dye, 6-(fluorescein-6-carboxamido) hexanoate (6FAM), at its 5&prime; terminus and a primary amine group at its 3&prime; terminus. The resulting oligonucleotides that are immobilized on solid glass supports have the following structure: 5&prime;-(6FAM)TACGGACGGAAACTG<highlight><uline>TTTTTTTTTTTT</uline></highlight> (C-7 amine)-3&prime;, and 5&prime;-(6FAM)TACGGACAGAAACTG<highlight><uline>TTTTTTTTTTTT</uline></highlight> (C-7 amine)-3&prime;, and the second oligonucleotide contains the mutation G to A (position 8) leading to change at amino acid 145 (Glycine to Arginine) of human hepatitis B virus surface antigen. There is also an inclusion of a poly-T (underlined) as a synthetic linker aiming at facilitating the subsequent hybridization reaction with target human viral DNA sequences from serum samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention also concerns the design of synthetic oligonucleotides that can be used to amplify target human hepatitis B virus surface antigen DNA from serum samples, prior to their hybridization with the oligonucleotide immobilized on solid glass supports as mentioned above. Specifically, these oligonucleotides used in polymerase chain reaction to generate amplified product of less than 150 base pairs and consist of the following structure: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> 1. first oligonucleotide having 20 nucleotides with a biotin group at its 5&prime; terminus (5&prime;-Biotin-AGGATCAACAACAACCAGTA-3&prime;, and located from position 489 to 508 as referred to the wild type human hepatitis B virus genome). The presence of a biotin group allows the separation of amplified DNA fragments using streptavidin magnetic particles; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> 2. second oligonucleotide having 20 nucleotides with a fluorescent dye Texas Red at its 5&prime; terminus, and complementary to the coding strand of human hepatitis B virus surface antigen (5&prime;-Texas red-ATCGTCCTGGGCTTTCGCAA-3&prime;, and located from position 634 to 615 as referred to the wild type human hepatitis B virus genome). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, serum samples may contain the human hepatitis B virus surface antigen mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine). The present invention enables its specific detection. For detection by means other than visualizing human hepatitis B viral surface antigen mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine) DNA fragments, the present invention can be further developed into gene chip whereby the oligonucleotide used in specific amplification of the said hepatitis B viral mutant is immobilized onto solid glass supports. The presence of the human hepatitis B virus surface antigen mutant <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> (Glycine to Arginine) in a particular serum samples can be detected by fluorescence signals upon hybridization with the immobilized oligonucleotide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Examples of applications of the present invention are shown below, however, the present invention shall in no way be limited to these examples. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> General Experimental Procedures </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Viral DNA from serum carrying either the wild type or mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine) of the human hepatitis B virus surface antigen is isolated as follows. 200 &mgr;l of the serum sample was added to 400 &mgr;l of lysis buffer (Tris chloride 10 mM, pH<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>.4, EDTA 1 mM, and sodium dodecyl sulfate 2%) and 25 &mgr;l of proteinase K (20 mg/ml), incubated at 65&deg; C. for 3 hours. Viral DNA is then extracted by phenol/chloroform and precipitated by ethanol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The coding region of the human hepatitis B virus surface antigen, either wild type or mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine), is amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following oligonucleotides: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> 1. The 5&prime; oligonucleotide is a sense oligonucleotide that matches the start site of the human hepatitis B surface antigen (5&prime;-ATGAATTCATGGAGAGCACAACATCAGGATTCCTA-3&prime;, and located from position 157 to 183 as referred to the wild type human hepatitis B viral genome), wherein the underlined nucleotides represent an additional site for restriction enzyme EcoRI; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> 2. The 3&prime; oligonucleotide is an anti-sense oligonucleotide that matches the stop site of the human hepatitis B surface antigen (5&prime;-GAGAATTCTCAAATGTATACCCAAAGACAAAAGAA-3&prime;, located from position 811 to 837 as referred to the wild type human hepatitis B viral genome), wherein the underlined nucleotides represent an additional site for restriction enzyme EcoRI; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Polymerase chain reaction using viral DNA as template is then carried out on a DNA Thermal Cycler (Perkin-Elmer, Cetus) for 35 cycles using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, U.S.A.). Cycling conditions consist of 1.5 minutes at denaturing temperature (94&deg; C.), 2 minutes at annealing temperature (53&deg; C.) and 2 minutes at extension temperature (72&deg; C.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Amplified viral DNA fragment (human hepatitis B virus surface antigen, either wild type or mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine)) is subjected to restriction enzyme by EcoRI, prior to cloning into pcDNA3.1 plasmid (InvitroGene, U.S.A.) pretreated by the same restriction enzyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For the novel detection system in the present invention, polymerase chain reaction is carried out using either plasmid DNA (containing coding region of either wild type or mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine) of human hepatitis B virus surface antigen) , or viral DNA as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Oligonucleotides used in the said polymerase chain reaction are listed in claim 1 and have the following localization on the wild type human hepatitis B viral genome: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> 1. the 5&prime; oligonucleotide having 14 nucleotides (5&prime;-TACGGACAGAAACT-3&prime;) covers positions 582 to 595. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Specifically, it contains the mutation G to A at position 8 of the said oligonucleotide, leading to change at amino acid 145 (Glycine to Arginine) of the human hepatitis B virus surface antigen; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> 2. the 3&prime;oligonucleotide having 21 nucleotides (5&prime;-TTAGGGTTTAAATCTATACCC-3&prime;) covers positions 842 to 822. Specifically, it is an anti-sense oligonucleotide that is complementary to the coding strand of human hepatitis B virus surface antigen. Cycling conditions of polymerase chain reaction using the above-mentioned oligonucleotides are as follows: 1.5 minutes at denaturing temperature (94&deg; C.) , 2 minutes at annealing temperature (50&deg; C.) and 2 minutes at extension temperature (72&deg; C.). Amplified product is visualized after eletrophoresis on an 2% agarose gel. A total of 35 cycles using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, U.S.A.) generate an amplified product of expected size (240 base pairs) for plasmid (lane 2 in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and viral DNA (lane 4 in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) carrying human hepatitis B virus surface antigen mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine). The specificity of the detection system in the present invention is indicated by the absence of amplified product using templates carrying the wild type human hepatitis B virus surface antigen (plasmid template in lane 1, and viral DNA in lane 3 of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The said specificity is further supported by the absence of amplified product using templates carrying mutations leading to amino acid changes at position 126, 129 and 133 of the human hepatitis B virus surface antigen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Example 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Detection of human hepatitis B virus surface antigen mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine) on solid glass supports (Gene Chip) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An increasing number of human hepatitis B virus mutants are being identified. Whereas some of them derive from random variations during viral replication cycles, many others emerge from selection pressure such as immunoprophylaxis with vaccines and therapeutic treatment with antiviral drugs. These &lsquo;escape&rsquo; mutants are of concern as they are generally replicative and some can be infectious leading to acute liver diseases. Identification of such human hepatitis B virus mutants from serum samples is therefore of great importance. One of the most powerful approaches would be a differential amplification by mutation-specific oligonucleotide probes, as described in the present invention. With appropriate selection of oligonucleotide and amplification conditions, our novel detection system in the present invention allows the discrimination between a target human hepatitis B virus and the said mutant 145 (Glycine to Arginine) by only a single base. However, the manual and laborious gel-based analysis of amplified products could comprise its use in routine detection of the increasing numbers of human hepatitis B virus mutants, in particular those carrying mutations on the antigenic &lsquo;a&rsquo; epitope of the viral surface antigen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A promising alternative approach to this problem would be the development of analytical device that allows the simultaneous detection of different mutations, such as an array of hundreds or thousands of immobilized oligonucleotides (gene chip). In the case of human hepatitis B virus surface antigen, solid glass supports with immobilized oligonucleotides that carry specific mutations would allow their simple and rapid detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As a direct application of the novel detection system in the present invention, modifications have been added to two oligonucleotides (listed in claim 5): 5&prime;-TACGGACGGAAACT-3&prime;, and 5&prime;-TACGGACAGAAACT-3&prime;, both located from position 582 to 595 as referred to the wild type human hepatitis B virus genome. These include a fluorescent dye, 6-(fluorescein-6-carboxamido) hexanoate, at its 5&prime; terminus for microscopic detection and a primary amine group at its 3&prime; terminus allowing its immobilization on solid glass supports. The resulting oligonucleotides that are immobilized on solid glass supports has the following structure: 5&prime;-(6FAM)TACGGACGGAAACTG<highlight><uline>TTTTTTTTTTTT</uline></highlight> (C-7 amine)-3&prime;, and 5&prime;-(6FAM)TACGGACAGAAACTG<highlight><uline>TTTTTTTTTTTT</uline></highlight> (C-7 amine)-3&prime;, and the second oligonucleotide contains the mutation G to A (position 8 of the oligonucleotide, in bold) leading to change at amino acid 145 (Glycine to Arginine) of human hepatitis B virus surface antigen. There is also an inclusion of a poly-T (underlined) as a synthetic linker aiming at optimizing the subsequent hybridization reaction with target human viral DNA sequences from serum samples. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The said modified oligonucleotides are then immobilized on solid glass supports that are activated as follows: </paragraph>
