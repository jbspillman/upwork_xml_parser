<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a video signal processing apparatus and, more particularly, to a video signal processing apparatus improving image quality when illuminance is low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When an image is picked up by a video terminal having a camera device using an image pickup device such as a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) under low illuminance condition, for example indoors or at night outside, video images picked up by the camera device may be extremely dark or suffer from much noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The picked up video images become extremely dark as sensitivity of the image pickup device such as the CCD employed in the camera device is low. As semiconductors have been developed to be smaller and smaller recently, the CCD has also been reduced in size, and hence the number of signal electrons handled by one pixel has been reduced. Therefore, the output level of the CCD for an image picked up under dark condition becomes small, resulting in low sensitivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The cause of extremely conspicuous noise is that shot noise generated at the time of photoelectric conversion becomes innegligible, as the number of signal electrons per pixel has been reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The following methods have been conventionally known as effective in improving sensitivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> a) To enlarge aperture ratio of iris. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> b) To set shutter speed slower and to make exposure time longer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> c) To improve signal level by signal processing such as AGC (Auto Gain Control). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> d) To improve signal level by signal processing through frame addition method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As to the method a), that is, to increase aperture ratio of an iris, the larger the aperture ratio, the larger lens must be mounted. When an image is picked up under bright condition, a camera sensor would be saturated when the aperture ratio is large. Therefore, there is a limit in increasing the aperture ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> When automatic iris mechanism is mounted on the lens, the lens body will be increased in size, and the cost is also increased. Therefore, for a video terminal of which cost or power consumption is of priority, a fixed iris having relatively small aperture ratio must be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As to the method b), most of the image pickup devices such as the CCD allows free adjustment of shutter speed, by variable electronic shutter control. When an NTSC (National Television System Committee) video signal is to be generated, there is a limit of shutter speed in accordance with NTSC standard, which requires video signals of thirty (30) frames per second. Therefore, most image pickup devices allow control of shutter speed to the minimum (longest exposure time) of {fraction (1/30)} sec. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A specific example of the prior art utilizing the method c) is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, an AGC circuit includes a GCA (Gain Control Amplifier) circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected to an output of D/A (Digital to Analog) converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which will be described later, an A/D (Analog to Digital) converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> connected to an output of GCA circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> connected to an output of A/D converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and a D/A converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> connected to an output of signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A video signal output from an image pickup device is first input to GCA circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as an input signal to AGC circuit. GCA circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> amplifies the input video signal, in accordance with a gain control signal G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;, which will be described later, obtained from D/A converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The amplified video signal is input to A/D converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and converted to a digital video signal. The video signal which has been converted to the digital video signal is output as an output video signal of AGC circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The output video signal is at the same time supplied to signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> detects the level of the present video signal, from the output video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The result of level detection is input to D/A converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as a gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. D/A converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> converts gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; to an analog control signal, and provides the gain control signal G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The output gain control signal G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; is fed back to GCA circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and automatic gain control takes place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the change in gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; output from signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> when illuminance gradually changes from high (bright) to low (dark) will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> When the illuminance is high, the signal level is high, and therefore a small gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;&equals;min is output to provide low gain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As the illuminance gradually lowers, the signal level becomes higher, and therefore gain control coefficient gradually increases to K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;&equals;max to attain higher gain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> When the luminance attains still lower (darker) after gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; attains to K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;&equals;max, the maximum value of gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;&equals;max is maintained. Therefore, the signal level becomes lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As to the method d), that is, frame addition method, Japanese Patent Laying-Open No. 5-344417 entitled &ldquo;High Sensitivity Camera&rdquo; proposes a video signal processing apparatus which improves output level of the image pickup device under low illuminance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17, a</cross-reference> frame addition circuit constituting a part of a conventional video signal processing apparatus includes an A/D converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, an image memory <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> connected to an output of A/D converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and an adder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> connected to image memory <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and to an output of A/D converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The video signal output from the image pickup device is first input to A/D converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A/D converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> converts the input video signal to a digital video signal, and outputs the digital video signal to image memory <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and adder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Image memory <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a storage capacity of one frame, and operates as a one frame delay circuit. The video signal delayed by one frame and the present video signal not delayed, output from A/D converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are input to adder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and added to each other. The added video signal is output as an output video signal of the frame addition circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The AGC circuit implementing the method c) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is capable of amplifying a video signal of a very low level picked up with low illuminance always to a constant level, by automatic gain control in accordance with the present video signal level. Therefore, the AGC circuit has been used in many video terminals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> When a video signal of a very low level picked up with low illuminance is amplified with high gain, however, shot noise is also amplified, which means that the noise component is increased, degrading S/N (signal/noise) ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Further, the frame addition circuit implementing the method d) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> provides video signals of twice the amplitude level, as a video signal delayed by one frame and a present video signal not delayed are added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Further, the noise component is a shot noise with low frame correlation. Therefore, when frames with noise components are added, in most cases the addition is between a pixel with noise component and another pixel without noise component. Therefore, the original video signal is doubled by addition, while noise component is not added but averaged in the added two frames. Therefore, noise component level can be suppressed to some extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As still images are added and averaged, the signal to noise ratio S/N of each image can be improved in the following manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Generally, the S/N ratio of an optical system is represented by the following equation.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Namely, the signal and the quantum noise are increased in accordance with the input photoelectric power P and the sensor magnification M. On the other hand, thermal noise is not dependent thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, thermal noise is negligible when an image is picked up using a sensor having high magnification with sufficient optical input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> When the optical input is weak (dark), however, these noises cannot be entirely neglected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The reason for this is as follows. The quantum noise (shot noise) has statistical fluctuation, as the incident light has the nature of particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The fluctuation has Poisson distribution, and when an average value of the number of photons incident on one pixel is represented as n, standard deviation is given by {square root}{square root over (n)}, which represents fluctuation, or noise. Accordingly, the following definition is given.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when the number of photons is increased, that is, when integration (addition) is performed, n increases, and hence SIN ratio increases accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Addition and averaging of thermal noise is considered addition of sources of mutually not correlated noises in normal distribution (correlation coefficient &ggr;&equals;0), and noise power is added directly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The system noise refers to the noise inherent to the system such as quantum noise introduced by A/D converter, and the system noise has different nature dependent on the cause of generation. Therefore, general discussion is impossible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As to the quantum noise mentioned above, by AGC, signal intensity can be made uniform, and therefore quantum noise derived from A/D converter, for example, can be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> By addition (averaging) described above, noise corresponding to quantum noise can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The noise component itself, however, still exists, and therefore when the degree of image quality degradation in terms of S/N ratio is monitored for a prescribed time period, for example over several seconds, improvement in S/N ratio cannot be attained as in the case of AGC circuit of c). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In other words, the effect of improvement is not observed when continuous images are viewed as a whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> When the level improvement of twice or more is to be attained by the frame addition circuit, an image memory <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and an adder <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are added, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. In this manner, a video signal delayed by two frames, a video signal delayed by one frame and the present video signal not delayed are added, so that a video signal having three times the amplitude level is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> By adding a video signal preceding one frame further, it is possible to obtain a video signal of which magnification is increased to 2, 3, 4 . . . What can be attained, however, is only the level improvement of integer multiple, and multistep control performed on tones of which accuracy is determined by the number of bits of D/A converter as in AGC circuit of c) is impossible. Therefore, what is attained is always level improvement to a prescribed extent only. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The present invention was made to solve the above described problems and its object is to provide a video signal processing apparatus capable of improving signal level while reducing noise component by a process of adding and averaging frames, no matter a video signal of what illuminance is input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a video signal processing apparatus capable of improving signal level while reducing noise component by a process of adding and averaging lines and frames, no matter a video signal of what illuminance is input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A still further object of the present invention is to provide a video signal processing apparatus capable of improving signal level while reducing noise component, no matter a scaled video signal of what illuminance is input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A still further object of the present invention is to provide a video signal processing apparatus capable of optimal control of filter parameter for noise reduction, no matter a video signal of what illuminance is input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> According to an aspect of the present invention, a video signal processing apparatus includes: a video signal amplifying circuit amplifying an input video signal and outputting a video signal of a predetermined image size in accordance with a gain control coefficient; a frame addition circuit connected to the video signal amplifying circuit for adding by a predetermined number of frames, the outputs of the video signal amplifying circuit; a first signal level detecting circuit connected to the video signal amplifying circuit, for calculating the gain control coefficient and a multiplication coefficient in accordance with an output of the video signal amplifying circuit; and a first multiplier connected to the frame addition circuit and the first signal level detecting circuit, receiving as inputs the output of the frame addition circuit and the multiplication coefficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The gain control coefficient and the multiplication coefficient are calculated in accordance with the brightness of the video signal. Therefore, when a video signal which is within a relatively bright illuminance range is input, adding and averaging process is performed by the frame addition circuit and the multiplier. Thus noise component is reduced. When a video signal which is within a relatively dark illuminance range is input, the multiplication coefficient is increased as the signal level of the video signal decreases. Thus the process of adding and averaging frames is performed, so that the signal level can be improved while the noise component is reduced. When a video signal which is within darker illuminance range is input, the multiplication coefficient is made closer to 1 to perform the process of adding frames. Thus the signal level is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the frame addition circuit includes: a line memory connected to the video signal amplifying circuit for video signals of one line; a video memory connected to the video signal amplifying circuit for video signals of one frame; a first adder connected to the video signal amplifying circuit and the line memory and receiving as inputs an output of the video signal amplifying circuit and the video signals stored in the line memory; and a second adder connected to the first adder and the image memory and receiving as inputs an output of the first adder and the video signals stored in the image memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The gain control coefficient and the multiplication coefficient are calculated in accordance with the brightness of the video signal. Therefore, when a video signal which is within a relatively bright illuminance range is input, adding and averaging processes between lines and between frames are performed by the first and second addition circuits and the multiplier. Thus, noise component is reduced. When a video signal which is within a relatively dark illuminance range is input, the multiplication coefficient is increased as the signal level of the video signal decreases. Thus adding and averaging processes between lines and between frames are performed, so that the signal level can be improved while the noise component is reduced. When a video signal which belongs to darker illuminance range is input, the multiplication coefficient is made closer to 1, and adding processes between lines and between frames are performed. Thus, signal level is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> More preferably, the video signal amplifying circuit includes: an amplifying circuit for amplifying the input video signal; and a first scaling circuit connected to the amplifying circuit for scaling an image data constituted by the outputs of the amplifying circuit at a prescribed magnification. The frame addition circuit includes: a first image memory connected to the first scaling circuit and storing a predetermined number of outputs of the first scaling circuit; and an accumulation adder for accumulating and adding the output of the first scaling circuit and the prescribed number of outputs of the first scaling circuit stored in the first image memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The gain control coefficient and the multiplication coefficient are calculated in accordance with the brightness of the video signal. The video signal is scaled by a predetermined magnification, by the first scaling circuit. Therefore, when a video signal within a relatively bright illuminance range is input, adding and averaging process among a predetermined number of frames is performed by the accumulation adder. Thus, noise component is reduced. When a video signal within a relatively dark illuminance range is input, the multiplication coefficient is made larger as the signal level of the video signal decreases. Thus, adding and averaging process between frames is performed, so that the signal level can be improved while the noise component is reduced. When a video signal of a darker illuminance range is input, the multiplication coefficient is made closer to 1, and accumulation and adding process between frames is performed. Thus the signal level is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> More preferably, the first signal level detecting circuit includes a second signal level detecting circuit connected to the video signal amplifying circuit and calculating the gain control coefficient, the multiplication coefficient and a first filter parameter coefficient in accordance with an output of the video signal amplifying circuit. The video signal processing circuit further includes a noise reduction circuit connected to the first multiplier and to the second signal level detecting circuit and performing noise reduction of an output of the first multiplier in accordance with the first filter parameter coefficient and the output of the first multiplier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The first filter parameter coefficient is calculated in accordance with the brightness of the video signal. More specifically, when a video signal within a relatively bright illuminance range is input, the first filter parameter coefficient is calculated such that by the amount of reduction of the noise component realized by the adding and averaging process, filter parameter of the noise reduction circuit is weakened. In a relatively dark illuminance range, the first filter parameter coefficient is calculated such that the filter parameter of the noise reduction circuit is gradually increased as the effect of noise component reduction attained by the adding and averaging process decreases. In a darker illuminance range, the first filter parameter coefficient is calculated to maximize the filter parameter of the noise reduction circuit. In this manner, the filter parameter of the noise reduction circuit is automatically controlled, realizing optimal noise reduction of the video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The video signal output from an image pickup device is first input to GCA circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as an input video signal. GCA circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> amplifies the input video signal by a gain control signal G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> obtained from D/A converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The amplified video signal is input to A/D converter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, converted to a digital video signal, and output as a video signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Video signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which has been converted to a digital video signal is output to image memory <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and to adder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Video signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> output at this time is also supplied to signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> detects the present video signal level from video signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> output from A/D converting circuit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The result of level detection is input as gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to D/A converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. D/A converter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> converts gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to an analog control signal and provides a gain control signal GI. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The output gain control signal G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fed back to GCA circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and automatic gain control is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Image memory <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a storage capacity of one frame and operates as a one frame delay circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> A video signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> delayed by one frame and the not delayed present video signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> output from A/D converting circuit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are input to adder <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and added together. The resulting video signal S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is input to multiplier <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> output from signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is input to multiplier <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the added video signal S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is multiplied by multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and the result of multiplication is output as an output video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, coefficients output from signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> also shows a coefficient curve of gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; when the video signal is amplified only by the AGC circuit described with respect to the background art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for controlling the gain of GCA circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> changes in the similar manner as the coefficient curve of gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; obtained when the video signal is amplified only by the AGC circuit, to a certain brightness, when the brightness gradually changes from bright to dark. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The certain brightness refers to that brightness at which the signal level attains twice the signal level amplifiable with gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; being max, and the gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at that time is K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;const<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Even when the illuminance becomes darker from here, gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;const<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is maintained, and therefore the signal level attains lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Next, the change in multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is multiplexed by the video signal S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which results from addition by adder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and is input to multiplier <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, when the illuminance gradually changes from bright to dark will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> To a certain brightness, multiplication coefficient is not changed but constant at K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;0.5. The multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;0.5 means &frac12;. Namely, this coefficient represents addition and averaging process performed by adder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and multiplier <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and the period in which the coefficient is kept constant will be referred to as addition and averaging period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The certain brightness refers to that brightness at which gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;const<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> As the illuminance becomes darker from here, multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> increases, until multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> attains 1 when a signal level detected by signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> attains to a certain constant value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The time when &ldquo;the signal level detected by the signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> attains to a certain constant value&rdquo; refers to the time when the gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; when the video signal is amplified only by the AGC circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> attains to K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;&equals;max, as is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is variable from 0.5 to 1, and therefore this period is referred to as variable period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> When the brightness becomes still darker, multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is maintained constant at K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;1, and multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> does not change any more even when the illuminance becomes darker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> That the multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;1 means that the signal level is not changed by multiplier <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and only the addition process of two frames is performed by adder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Therefore, this period is referred to as addition period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In the addition and averaging period, the signal level is kept constant as the gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> changes, and noise component is reduced as the adding and averaging process among frames is performed by adder <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and multiplier <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In the variable period, gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is constant and amplification rate is not changed. Therefore, as the illuminance becomes darker, the signal level decreases. However, the noise component is not amplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> As multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> changes between 0.5 and 1, noise component is reduced and the signal level is improved, as adding and averaging process among frames is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In the addition period, addition of frames is performed, and therefore signal level twice that before the addition process is obtained, and thus improvement is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment, in a relatively bright illuminance range, adding and averaging process among frames is performed, whereby noise component is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In a relatively dark illuminance range, adding and averaging process among frames is performed, whereby noise component is reduced and the signal level is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In a darker illuminance range, addition among frames is performed, whereby the signal level is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In this manner, the video signal level is enhanced twice, and the noise component generated in that video signal can be reduced, whereby good image quality is ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the second embodiment will be described. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Where n&equals;4, the first scaling circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> operates to reduce the video signal to the image size of &frac14; in terms of pixel number ratio. This means that the normal video signal image size of 352 pixels in horizontal direction and 288 pixels in the vertical direction is reduced to the size of 176 pixels in the horizontal direction and 144 pixels in the vertical direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> When n&equals;4, the second scaling circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> operates to enlarge the video signal to four times the image size in terms of the pixel number ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> This means that the video signal of the image size of 176 pixels in the horizontal direction and 144 pixels in the vertical direction before scaling, for example, is enlarged to the image size of 352 pixels in the horizontal direction and 288 pixels in the vertical direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Where n&equals;4, image memory <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has four memory areas, that is, memory areas a, b, c and d, and is subjected to memory control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> Here, image memory <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> stores delayed video signals one frame to four frames preceding the present signal and reduced to &frac14;.

<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The video signal S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is input to the second scaling circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The n times enlarged video signal generated by the second scaling circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is passed through switching circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and provided as an output video signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Coefficients output from signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. A coefficient curve of gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; described with respect to the background art is also shown, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for controlling the gain of GCA circuit <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> changes in the similar manner as the coefficient curve of gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; obtained when the video signal is amplified only by the AGC circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, to a certain brightness, when the brightness gradually changes from bright to dark. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> The certain brightness refers to that brightness at which the signal level attains five times the signal level amplifiable with gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; being max, and the gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at that time is K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;const<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Even when the illuminance becomes darker from here, gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;const<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is maintained, and therefore the signal level attains lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> Next, the change in multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is multiplexed by the video signal S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> input to multiplier <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, when the illuminance gradually changes from bright to dark will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> To a certain brightness, multiplication coefficient is not changed but constant at K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;0.2. The multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;0.2 means &frac15;. Namely, this coefficient represents addition and averaging process performed by accumulation adder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and multiplier <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and the period will be referred to as addition and averaging period as in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> The certain brightness refers to that brightness at which gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;const<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, as can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> As the illuminance becomes darker from here, multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> increases, until multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> attains 1 when a signal level detected by signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> attains to a certain constant value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> The time when &ldquo;the signal level detected by the signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> attains to a certain constant value&rdquo; refers to the time when the gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; when the video signal is amplified only by the AGC circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> attains to K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;&equals;max, as is apparent from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> The multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is variable from 0.2 to 1, and therefore this period is referred to as variable period as in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> When the brightness becomes still darker, multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is maintained constant at K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;1, and multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> does not change any more even when the illuminance becomes darker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> That the multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;1 means that the signal level is not changed by multiplier <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and only the addition process of five frames is performed by accumulation adder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Therefore, this period is referred to as addition period as in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> In the addition and averaging period, the signal level is kept constant as the gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> changes similar to the operation of the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment, and noise component is reduced as the adding and averaging process among lines and frames is performed by adder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and multiplier <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> The addition and averaging period refers to the period of illuminance until the illuminance attains to the signal level five times the amplifiable signal level when gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; is max. Therefore, as compared with the operation of the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment, the addition and averaging period is still shorter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> In the variable period, gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is constant at K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;const<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and amplification rate is not changed. Therefore, as the illuminance becomes darker, the signal level decreases. However, the noise component is not amplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> As multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> changes between 0.2 and 1, noise component is reduced and the signal level is improved, as adding and averaging process among frames is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> The variable period refers to the period of illuminance from the brightness where the illuminance is five times the signal level of the amplifiable signal level with gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; being max until the brightness when gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime; obtained when the video signal is amplified by AGC circuit only is K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;&equals;max. Therefore, as compared with the operation of the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment, the variable period is still longer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> In the addition period, addition of five frames is performed, so that the signal level can be improved to be five times higher than before addition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> The second scaling circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and switching circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> described above are necessary circuits when the image size of the output video signal must be the same image size as the input video signal. Therefore, when the video signal of the image size obtained after scaling by first scaling circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is desired, second scaling circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and switching circuit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are unnecessary from the following reason. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> More specifically, when the image size of the normal video signal is 352 pixels in the horizontal direction and 288 pixels in the vertical direction, that is, when it is in compliance with CIF (common intermediate format) defined by recommendation H.261 or H.263 (standard document related to video encoding for narrow band communication channel) issued by International Telecommunication Union-Standardization Sector (ITU-T), the image size of the video signal reduced to &frac14; is 176 pixels in the horizontal direction and 144 pixels in the vertical direction. This corresponds to QCIF (Quarter Common Intermediate Format). Therefore, when the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the present invention is used for an image communication terminal in accordance with H.261 or H.263, the image size scaled to &frac14;, that is, image size of QCIF can be used as it is. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> In the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the fourth embodiment, the video signal reduce to 1/n in terms of pixel number ratio is generated, and therefore in a relatively bright illuminance range, adding and averaging process among (n&plus;1) frames is performed, whereby noise component is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> In a relatively dark illuminance range, adding and averaging process among (n&plus;1) frames is performed, whereby noise component is reduced while the signal level is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> In a darker illuminance range, addition among (n&plus;1) frames is performed, whereby the signal level is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> Therefore, even without the necessity of increasing image memory, the video signal level picked up at low illuminance can be improved by (n&plus;1) times, and the noise component of the video signal can further be reduced, so that good image quality is ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> Fifth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the fifth embodiment will be described. Portions corresponding to the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment are denoted by the same reference characters and description thereof is not repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the configuration of the video signal processing apparatus differs from that of the first embodiment in that it additionally includes a frame cyclic type noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Further, in place of signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> The frame cyclic type noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> includes: a motion detection circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected to multiplier <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and detecting a motion pixel from a video signal S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which has been improved with respect to low illuminance; a coefficient control unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> connected to signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and motion detection circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and controlling a filter parameter coefficient; a multiplier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> connected to multiplier <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and coefficient control unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>; a multiplier <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> connected to coefficient control unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and an image memory <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which will be described later; an adder <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> connected to multipliers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>; and an image memory <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> connected to adder <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, having a storage capacity of one frame and operating as a one frame delay circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> The video signal S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which has been improved with respect to low illuminance output from video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment is input to motion detection circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and multiplier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Motion detection circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> calculates an amount of change in motion of each pixel from the video signal S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which has been improved for low illuminance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> The calculated motion information is input to coefficient control unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. A filter parameter coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> output from signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the video signal processing apparatus is also input to coefficient control unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Coefficient control unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> changes the filter parameter coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in the range of 0 to 1 in accordance with the motion information provided from motion detection circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, based on the filter parameter coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> obtained from the signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the video signal processing apparatus, to generate a filter parameter coefficient K<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> More specifically, when it is determined that there is no motion information detected by motion detection circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, filter parameter coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is directly used as filter parameter coefficient K<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. When there is motion information detected by motion detection circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a coefficient obtained by reducing filter parameter coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is used as the filter parameter coefficient K<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> Based on the filter parameter coefficient K<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> generated in coefficient control unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, (1&minus;K<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is applied to applied to multiplier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and K<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is applied to multiplier <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> The video signal S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which has been improved with respect to low illuminance is first multiplied by (1&minus;K<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) in multiplier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, whereby video signal S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> Here, image memory <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> has a storage capacity of one frame and operates as a one frame delay circuit. Image memory <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> stores the output video signal S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> generated one frame before, and the one frame delayed output video signal S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is supplied to multiplier <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> The output video signal S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> delayed by one frame is multiplied by K<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in multiplier <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and a video signal S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Video signals S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> generated by multipliers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are input to adder <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and added together, thus an output video signal is generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> The generated output video signal is also input to image memory <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and it is used for generating the output video signal delayed by one frame, mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> In the frame cyclic type noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the effect of reducing noise component is higher if the filter parameter coefficient K<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is larger (closer to 1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> As the frame cyclic type noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> operates in the above described manner, a time filter having frequency characteristic in the time axis direction degraded is provided, whereby shot noise without frame correlation can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> Based on the motion information detected by motion detection circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, filter parameter is changed by frame cyclic noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, so as to reduce afterimage or blurring caused by an application of a time filter to a motion pixel without frame correlation as frequency characteristic from the time axis degrades. When motion information is detected by motion detection circuit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a smaller filter parameter coefficient is adopted to reduce afterimage or blurring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, coefficients output from signal level detecting circuit <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>

The variable period of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is the same as the variable period described with reference to the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> When the illuminance attains still darker, filter parameter control coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> increases from filter parameter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to filter parameter HIGH, at the same rate of increase as in the addition and averaging period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> This period of change is the same as the addition period described with reference to the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> The reason why the filter parameter control coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has such a change characteristic will be described in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> The filter parameter control coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is not intended to improve signal level by frame addition process such as implemented in the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment, that is, the noise characteristic when the effect of reducing noise component by addition and averaging process in the addition and averaging period and the variable period for improving low illuminance. More specifically, the filter parameter control coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; changes in accordance with the noise characteristic when the signal level is improved by the AGC circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> only, as described with reference to the background art. The filter parameter control coefficient with the effect of improvement in the signal level attained by frame addition process as in the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment subtracted, is applied to the filter parameter control coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This is the reason why the filter parameter control coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has such a characteristic as it changes, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> In the addition and averaging period, similar to the operation of the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment, the signal level is kept constant as the gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> changes, and the noise component is reduced as the addition and averaging process among frames is performed by the adder and the multiplier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> Further, as the noise component is reduced by the addition and averaging process, the noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> operates to weaken the filter parameter of noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> In the variable period, gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is constant at K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;const<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the rate of increase does not change. Therefore, as the illuminance attains darker, the signal level becomes smaller, whereas the noise component is not amplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0249" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0249&rsqb;</number> The multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> changes between 0.5 and 1. Therefore, by the addition and averaging process among frames, noise component is reduced while the signal level is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0250" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0250&rsqb;</number> As the noise component is reduced by the addition and averaging process in the variable period, noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> operates to weaken the filter parameter of noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0251" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0251&rsqb;</number> In the addition period, addition among frames is performed, so that the signal level is improved to twice higher. Noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> operates such that the filter parameter of the noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> attains filter parameter HIGH. Thus the filter parameter of the noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is automatically controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0252" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0252&rsqb;</number> In the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the fifth embodiment, in a relatively bright illuminance range, the noise component is reduced by the addition and averaging process and the filter parameter of the noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is weakened by that amount. Therefore, afterimage or blurring, generated when the time filter is applied even to motion pixels without any frame correlation, can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0253" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0253&rsqb;</number> Further, in a relatively dark illuminance range, as the detected signal level lowers, the filter parameter of the noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be increased gradually to compensate for the decrease in noise reduction effect attained by the addition and averaging process. Therefore, decrease in noise reduction effect attained by the addition and averaging process can be compensated for by the noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0254" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0254&rsqb;</number> In a darker illuminance range, the filter parameter of the noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is maximized, so that the noise component reduction effect which cannot be attained by the addition process can be assisted by the noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the level of a video signal picked up at low illuminance can be improved to be twice higher, afterimage or blurring can be suppressed, and noise component generated in the video signal can be reduced even at the low illuminance, whereby good image quality is ensured. </paragraph>

The variable period of the present embodiment is the same as the variable period described with reference to the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> When the illuminance attains still darker, filter parameter control coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> increases from filter parameter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to filter parameter HIGH, at the same rate of increase as in the addition and averaging period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> This period of change is the same as the addition period described with reference to the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> The reason why the filter parameter control coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has such a change characteristic will be described in the following. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> The filter parameter control coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is not intended to improve signal level by frame addition process such as implemented in the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment, that is, the noise characteristic when the effect of reducing noise component by addition and averaging process in the addition and averaging period and the variable period for improving low illuminance. More specifically, the filter parameter control coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&prime; changes in accordance with the noise characteristic when the signal level is improved by the AGC circuit only, as described with reference to the background art. The filter parameter control coefficient with the effect of improvement in the signal level attained by frame addition process as in the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment subtracted, is applied to the filter parameter control coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This is the reason why the filter parameter control coefficient K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has such a characteristic as it changes, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> As to the amount subtracted of the effect of signal level improvement attained by the frame addition method, the effect of improvement of the signal level attained by the four frame addition method in accordance with the video signal processing apparatus of the present embodiment is higher than the two frame addition method of the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the fifth embodiment, and therefore larger amount can be subtracted, than in the two frame addition method of the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the fifth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> In the addition and averaging period, similar to the operation of the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the first embodiment, the signal level is kept constant as the gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> changes, and the noise component is reduced as the addition and averaging process among frames is performed by the adder <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the multiplier <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> Further, as the noise component is reduced by the addition and averaging process, the noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> operates to weaken the filter parameter of noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> In the variable period, gain control coefficient K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is constant at K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;const<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, and the rate of increase does not change. Therefore, as the illuminance attains darker, the signal level becomes smaller, whereas the noise component is not amplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> The multiplication coefficient K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> changes between 0.25 and 1. Therefore, by the addition and averaging process among frames, noise component is reduced while the signal level is improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0329" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0329&rsqb;</number> As the noise component is reduced by the addition and averaging process in the variable period, noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> operates to weaken the filter parameter of noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0330" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0330&rsqb;</number> In the addition period, addition among frames is performed, so that the signal level is improved to four times higher. Noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> operates such that the filter parameter of the noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> attain filter parameter HIGH. Thus the filter parameter of the noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is automatically controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> The second scaling circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the switching circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> described above are necessary when the image size of the output video signal must be the same image size as the input video signal, as in the case of the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the fourth embodiment. Therefore, if the video signal may have the image size scaled by the first scaling circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the second scaling circuit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the switching circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> In the video signal processing apparatus in accordance with the seventh embodiment, similar effects as obtained by the sixth embodiment can be obtained. Further, video signals reduced to 1/n in pixel number ratio can be generated, and adding and averaging process among n frames is performed in a relatively bright illuminance range. Therefore, noise component is reduced. Further, as the noise component is reduced by the addition and averaging process among n frames, the filter parameter of the noise reduction circuit can be made weaker. Therefore, afterimage or blurring generated as a time filter is applied even to motion pixels without frame correlation can further be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> In a relatively dark illuminance range, adding and averaging process among n frames is performed. Thus, noise component is reduced while the signal level is improved. Further, as the detected signal level becomes lower, it is possible to gradually increase filter parameter of the noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> to compensate for the decrease in noise reduction effect attained by the adding and averaging process among n frames. Therefore, decrease in noise reduction effect attained by the adding and averaging process can be compensated for by the noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> In a still darker illuminance range, addition among n frames is performed, so that the signal level is improved. Further, the filter parameter of the noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is maximized, and therefore the effect of noise component reduction which cannot be attained by the addition process can be assisted by the noise reduction circuit <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the video signal level picked up at a low illuminance can be improved to n times higher, afterimage and blurring can be further suppressed, and noise component generated in the video signal can be suppressed even at a low illuminance, whereby good image quality is ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the spirit and scope of the present invention being limited only by the terms of the appended claims. </paragraph>
