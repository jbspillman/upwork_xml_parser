<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to apparatuses and systems for mounting an adjustable arm for a peripheral device such as a computer display screen, a keyboard, a telephone or the like. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Apparatuses and configurable mounting systems for mounting an arm device are disclosed. The arm device may be attached to a peripheral device, which may be an electronic device such as a computer display screen, a keyboard, a telephone or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The systems comprise a set of components which may be configured to create apparatuses including a clamp mount, a wall mount, a &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; wall mount, or table or &ldquo;flat&rdquo; mount. In addition, the systems may comprise components which may be configured to create a panel mount and a slat wall mount. The mounting systems have many benefits and advantages to the consumer, distributor and manufacturer. The consumer obtains more than one different mounting option for the price of a single mount. Previously, the consumer was required to choose the type of mount which she desired at the time of purchase of the arm. The systems also provide flexibility of providing a different mounting configuration in the future, if the consumer decides to move the arm or reconfigure the mount. A distributor of the mounting systems benefits by being relieved from maintaining an inventory of each of the different types of mounts. Also, the mounting systems may be efficiently packaged since the component elements are preferably no wider than the width of a typical arm apparatus. There are several advantages to the manufacturer including a decrease in inventory costs similar to that of the distributor, a lowering of the &ldquo;piece&rdquo; price of the mount since components of the systems may be used in a number of configurations and distinct castings are not required for each type of mount, and a decrease in labor costs since the consumer completes final assembly in the configuration she desires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The components of the mounting systems include a shaft holder for receiving the shaft of the arm device, a long &ldquo;L&rdquo; member, and short &ldquo;L&rdquo; member, a clamping plate, and clamping screw. In a preferred embodiment, these components are used in conjunction with standard hardware including a long bolt with a hex head, a short screw, a pair of screws having flat tapered countersunk heads, a pair of wall screws, and a single nut. With these components and hardware, at least four of the above-noted mounting configurations may be achieved by the mounting systems of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the configurable mount invention additionally comprises adapter brackets that are used to secure the mount to conventional office panel systems and both single and dual slot wall systems.</paragraph>
