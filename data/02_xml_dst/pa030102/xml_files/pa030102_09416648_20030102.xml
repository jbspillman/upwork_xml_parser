<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the field of respiratory masks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A respiratory mask is a device used to deliver a gas or gases to a person. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a respiratory mask <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the related art. The respiratory mask <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a mask shell <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a gas supply hose <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, a vent aperture <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and an optional gasket <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. The mask shell <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is fitted over a face of the person in order to supply a gas to a respiratory system of the person. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The respiratory mask <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be used to deliver any variety of gases, including air or oxygen, and a variety of medicines or treatments. Preferably, the mask shell does not allow a supplied gas to escape. A strap or other attaching means may be affixed to the mask shell and may be fitted over the head of the person. Constant pressure gas is therefore delivered, with the vent aperture <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> maintaining a substantially constant pressure in the mask. This is referred to as a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mask. The vent aperture <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> allows expired carbon dioxide to escape from the mask. It is important that the vent aperture <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> be of a sufficient size to exhaust substantially all expired carbon dioxide under normal conditions of use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the related art, the need for venting has meant simply an aperture on or close to the mask shell, whereby exhaled air is flushed out of the respiratory mask by the positive pressure generated by the gas supply hose. This is taught by Rapaport U.S. Pat. No. Re. 35,339. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Several drawbacks exist with the venting of the related art respiratory mask <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. First, the air circulation within the mask <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and vent aperture <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may create annoying noises. Second, a jet of air from the vent aperture <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may impinge on the wearer or on nearby persons. This can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, where the vent aperture <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and a resulting air jet are relatively close to the face of the wearer, and will in all likelihood be in the region of persons near to or sleeping with the wearer. As a result, these drawbacks may affect compliance with a therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there remains a need in the art for an improved respiratory mask. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a first embodiment of a variable aperture vented respiratory mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the present invention. The variable aperture vented respiratory mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a mask shell <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, a gas supply hose <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> attached to the mask shell <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, an optional gasket <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, and a gas flow volume regulating device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The gas flow volume regulating device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> further includes a hollow elastomeric truncated cone <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> having an internal diameter, an outer aperture <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> in the mask shell <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, and an inner aperture <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> disposed inside the mask shell and forming a truncated end of the hollow elastomeric truncated cone <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The gas flow volume regulating device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> forms a variable aperture that responds to the internal pressure of the CPAP mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in order to maintain a substantially constant gas flow volume out of the mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> regardless of pressure differences between the inside and the outside of the mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the gas flow volume regulating device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is designed with aperture sizes such that the resulting gas flow volume is adequate at the lowest CPAP working pressure, which is typically a pressure of about three to four cm H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O. In the preferred embodiment, a minimum gas flow volume ten to fifteen liters per minute at a pressure of four cm H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O air pressure is sufficient to vent the exhaled air from the mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Suitable aperture sizes are dependent on the cross-sectional geometry and depth of the hole. For example, with a round aperture and a wall thickness of 0.05 inch, to achieve a flow rate of 10-15 liter/min, the aperture diameter can be 0.157 inch at 4 cm H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O pressure, and 0.101 inch at 18 cm H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O pressure. Aperture sizes can fall between these values for intermediate pressures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In use, the variable aperture vented respiratory mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> receives a gas from the gas supply hose <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> at an essentially constant pressure. In the shown embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the exhaust gas flow is regulated by the deformation of the hollow elastomeric truncated cone <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. As the internal pressure in the mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> increases (i.e., during exhalation by the wearer), the hollow elastomeric truncated cone <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is increasingly deformed, decreasing the internal diameter. By regulating the size of the vent aperture, a volume of gas escaping from the gas flow volume regulating device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is kept below an objectionable level. It should be understood that a gas flow volume regulating device of any of the embodiments is preferably located on the mask shell, but alternatively may be located near the mask or on the gas supply hose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The gas flow volume regulating device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in this embodiment may be set to a desired flow volume by the choice of material composing the hollow elastomeric truncated cone <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, which can be, for example, silicone, polyurethane or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a second embodiment of a variable aperture vented respiratory mask <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The main components are identical to the mask <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and the reference numbers of the identical components are retained. The mask <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a gas flow volume regulating device <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, which further includes an elastic flap <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> that is positioned over an aperture <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. The gas flow volume regulating device <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> therefore includes a variable aperture that responds to the internal pressure of the CPAP mask <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In a normal state, such as when the internal pressure is low, the elastic flap <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> is normally displaced away from he aperture <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, allowing an uninhibited gas flow through the aperture <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. As the internal pressure increases, the elastic flap <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is displaced closer and closer to the aperture <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, regulating the gas flow volume through the aperture <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> and therefore regulating the internal pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The gas flow volume regulating device <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> in this embodiment may be set to a desired flow volume by the choice of material composing the elastic flap <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, which can be, for example, silicone, polyurethane or the like. The closing pressure on the flap can be varied, depending on the hardness of the material from which it is made, and the flap geometry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a third embodiment of a variable aperture vented respiratory mask <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The main components are identical to the mask <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and the reference numbers of the identical components are retained. The mask <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes a gas flow volume regulating device <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, which further includes an aperture <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, an electronically actuated member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, an actuator <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, a pressure sensor <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>, and a controller <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> connected to the actuator <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> by a control line <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight> and to the pressure sensor <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> by a signal line <highlight><bold>429</bold></highlight>. The gas flow volume regulating device <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> therefore includes a variable aperture that responds to the internal pressure of the mask <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> may be any type of general purpose controller, including a programmable device such as a microcontroller, a custom-built chip, or a hard-wired logic circuit. The actuator <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> may be any type of general purpose actuator, such as a servo-type actuator or solenoid-type actuator. In the preferred embodiment, the actuator <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> is a servo-type actuator that extends and retracts the electronically actuated member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> so as to cover or uncover the aperture <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the actuator <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> may move the electronically actuated member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> in some other manner, such as displacing it to a side of the aperture <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> or away from the aperture <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> into the interior of the mask shell <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In use, the controller <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> receives a pressure signal from the pressure sensor <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> over the signal line <highlight><bold>429</bold></highlight>. The controller may then adjust the placement of the electronically actuated member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> in relation to the aperture <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. The controller may do this by sending a control signal to the actuator <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> over the control line <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>. The actuator, in response to the control signal, may move the electronically actuated member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> to cover or uncover the aperture <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, thereby varying an effective size of the aperture <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the electronically actuated member <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> may move anywhere from a fully covering position to a fully uncovering position and anywhere in between. Alternatively, the actuator <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> may have only covering and uncovering positions, with gas flow volume regulation being accomplished by repeatedly covering and uncovering the aperture <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in detail above, the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific embodiments as described. It is evident that those skilled in the art may now make numerous uses and modifications of and departures from the specific embodiments described herein without departing from the inventive concepts. </paragraph>
