<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a game device and an image processing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> (1) Firstly, in the prior art, two-person game devices having input mechanisms for two people, whereby two players aim to score points in a co-operative or competitive fashion are known. A game device of this kind is designed such that it can be used as a one-person game device in cases where there is only one player. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, in multiple-person game devices of this kind, which are designed in such a manner that the respective input devices are mutually coupled, if the device is used, for example, as a one-person game device, then the input device which is not being used by the player will also move. There are no conventional game devices which take account of the danger of the fact that the input device not being used by the player is coupled to the input device that is being used by the player. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (2) Secondly, conventionally, there exist devices wherein two operating means which are mutually coupled are operated respectively by two people positioned facing each other. When making a game device based on this model, it is necessary to provide display means for displaying the state of operation of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, if a game device is designed in such a manner that it is operated by two players positioned facing each other, as described above, then it is necessary to provide two display means if display means are to be provided in front of the players so that they can be viewed easily by the players. Moreover, if it is attempted to manage with one display means only, then it is necessary to provide the display means at a position other than one in front of the players, therefore making it more difficult for the players to see the display means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Moreover, when making a game device based on this model, if an input mechanism is provided which comprises an operating section operated by a player, at one end thereof, and an support section which is axially supported such that it can reciprocally with respect to the main body of the device, at the other end thereof, and if this input mechanism is located in a position corresponding to the physical characteristics of the player, then the display area of the display means may be concealed by the support section of the input mechanism, if the position of the display area is not also raised accordingly. On the other hand, if the position of the display area is made too high, a problem arises in that the device as a whole becomes too large and moreover, the player will have to look upwards at the display means, and hence it becomes more difficult for the player to see the display area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> (3) Thirdly, conventionally, there is also known a two-person game device which comprises a pair of input mechanisms operated respectively by two players, whereby the two players aim to score points in a co-operative fashion. In a game device of this type, the input from one player is independent of the input from the other player, and hence each player is able to make his or her desired input regardless of the input made by the other player. However, in a conventional two-person game device, the respective points capability of each of the two players as individuals has a large influence on the points score achieved when two people play a game, whilst the degree of co-operation or teamwork between the two players has little influence on the points score. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> (4) Fourthly, conventionally, there is also known an image processing device whereby images of a three-dimensional model viewed from a specified viewpoint are displayed as a two-dimensional projection. In an image processing device of this kind, a sense of three-dimensionality can be applied to the image by creating object shadows, and the positional relationship between two objects can be conveyed to a viewer by forming the shadow of one object on another object. However, in some cases, depending on the position in which the shadow is formed, the shadow may conceal the object, for example, or it may be formed outside the display area of the screen, thereby making it impossible to depict a sense of three-dimensionality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> (5) Fifthly, in the field of game devices, there exist devices wherein images modeled on certain objects are displayed on display means, and the players play a game by performing various operations with respect to these objects. If the objects comprise, for example, a land surface and a moving object, then it is sometimes necessary, in terms of the characteristics of the objects, for certain conditions to be satisfied for an input to be made, for instance, the moving object is not able to leap through the air for a second time unless it has first landed on the land surface. However, in some cases, in a game device provided with an image processing device displaying images, wherein objects in a virtual three-dimensional space are viewed from a specified viewpoint, on display means, it may be difficult to comprehend the precise positional relationship between objects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Therefore, if a player thinks that the moving object has landed and makes an input for causing the moving object to jump, but the moving object has not in fact landed yet, then the game device will not accept the input. Consequently, since the input made by the player is not accepted by the device, the player will feel increased stress during the game, causing his or her enjoyment of the game to diminish. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> (6) sixthly, there exist game devices wherein the game content includes the action of having to avoid contact between obstacles and the object controlled by the player. In a game device of this kind, in some cases, obstacles moving over the land surface are avoided by, for example, causing the object to jump above the land surface. Here, since the amount of time the object remains in the air after jumping is limited, the amount of time for which it is able to avoid an obstacle is also limited. Therefore, if the obstacles become large in size, or the relative speed between the obstacles and the object controlled by the player becomes low, it may become impossible to avoid obstacles, even if the player causes the object to jump at optimum timing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> (7) Seventhly, in an image processing device, in some cases, an object moving through a virtual space must be displayed on the display means in such a manner that a second action in a series of actions including a first action and a second action is performed when the object is in a specified position. In this case, the period of time taken for the object to reach the aforementioned specified position from the current position thereof varies depending on the speed at which the object is moving, and the like. Therefore, it can be seen that if the speed of the object is high, the time period from starting the first action until the second action is performed is shortened, whilst if the speed of the object is low, then the object can be caused to perform the second action at the specified position by slowing down the action of the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> However, there is a risk that if the time period from the object starting the first action until it performs the second action increases or decreases, then an unnatural image will result. On the other hand, if the action is performed at a uniform time period, then the position at which the object should start the first action will vary depending on the speed of the object, and the like, and hence it cannot be defined in a universal manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> (8) Eighthly, in an image processing device applied in a fighting game, chase game, or the like, in some cases, a third object (such as an obstacle, missile, or the like) is thrown or fired by a first object (enemy character) at a second object (player&apos;s character). In this case, the time period taken for the third object to reach the second object after it has been fired from the first object varies depending on the speed of the third object, the speed of the second object, and the distance between the first object and second object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> However, the time period taken for the third object to reach the second object after being fired from the first object greatly affects the level of difficulty of the game, and by changing this time period, it is possible to make the game more easy or more difficult than necessary. Here, if the speed of the second object and the distance between the first object and the second object are adjusted in order to match this time period to the level of difficulty of the game, then the image will become unnatural. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> (9) Ninthly, there exist game devices having a game content which involves the player selecting one of a specified set of choices. For example, in a vehicle-based game, junction points may be provided on a course and the player is made to select one or other course. This game device is programmed in such a manner that if the player selects the correct course, then this has a beneficial result, and if the player selects the wrong course, then this has a disadvantageous result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Here, a method may be used whereby, if the player has not made a selecting operation, then the vehicle is caused to veer off the course, for example. Moreover, if the player does not enter a valid operation for the selecting operation, then a scene may be depicted where, for instance, the vehicle crashes into an obstacle provided between the branches of the course. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> However, if a scene of this kind is created, then a control program for same and further programs and data for depicting the destruction or the vehicle will be required, hence increasing the operational load on the game device, as well as taking up memory in the game device and increasing the information processing load in the game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> (10) Tenthly, some game devices are provided with means for displaying points, and when a specified points deduction event occurs, a number of points corresponding to that event is deducted, and if the remaining points total reaches zero, the game is ended. However, if a major points deduction event occurs during a game, for example, then a situation may arise where a number of points that is larger than the remaining points total is deducted in one step, thereby causing the game to end suddenly, even though the player thought that he or she had sufficient points remaining. This type of situation may cause distrust or stress in the player with respect to the game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In particular, if the loss of points is depicted by pictorial change rather than by a gauge, then in many cases it may be difficult for the player to comprehend accurately the remaining points total in the game and the points reductions corresponding to individual points deduction events. Consequently, the player may experience distrust or stress if the game ends suddenly. </paragraph>

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the game device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> according to the present invention comprises a main unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a playing platform <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A processing device comprising a central processing unit, and the like, for carrying out game processing is installed in the main unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The main unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also comprises a screen display section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> forming display means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for displaying the state of the game, this screen display section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> being in an upright position inclined towards the rear when viewed from the front face of the game device. The playing platform <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is provided with input devices, described hereinafter, which can be mounted by two players. The main unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and playing platform <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are electrically connected by a cord, in such a manner that input signals from the input devices are transmitted to the main unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The playing platform is also provided with two handles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which are mutually coupled and operated respectively by the players, hands, and two pedals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which are operated respectively by the players&apos; feet. The handles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are respectively supported by a support section <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> at one end thereof, and are formed into a T-shaped handle <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> forming the operating section of the handle at the other end thereof. Motive force transmitting means <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is supported by an axle between the support section <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and the operating section <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, thereby transmitting motive force generated by operation of the handle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to other sections of the game device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The pedals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> have a rectangular plate shape and are designed in such a manner that a switch is turned on when the player presses down on the pedal with one foot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Summary of Game </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Next, an outline of a game played by two players using this game device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is described. When a player inserts a coin and enters a specified command for starting the game, a game screen is displayed on the screen display section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the game device main unit <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the game starts. The game screen shows a two-dimensional projection of a scene wherein two parallel rails are laid on a land surface (or in the air, on a water surface or in water) provided in a virtual three-dimensional space, and a four-wheeled truck (players&apos; truck) driven by characters representing the players (players&apos; characters) is running along these rails. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> On the rails in the forward direction of travel of the players&apos; truck, a character representing an enemy of the players (enemy character), who is holding a jewel, is fleeing in a similar truck (enemy truck). The enemy character implements a variety of attacks on the players&apos; characters, but if, under the control of the players, the players&apos; characters evade these attacks and are able to catch up with the enemy truck and take possession of the jewel, then they can win the game. If the players&apos; characters are not able completely to avoid the attacks of the enemy and if they collide with various obstacles, then they will gradually lose points and the players&apos; truck will gradually break apart, and when the players&apos; truck is finally destroyed, the remaining points total will become zero and the game will end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> If a player moves the handle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> upwards and downwards, imparting a paddling action to the truck, then the players&apos; truck is able to catch up with the enemy truck, and is also able to avoid obstacles, such as shares, or the like, approaching from behind. If the handle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is moved upwards and downwards quickly, then the speed of the players&apos; truck can be quickened accordingly. Moreover, if the track is going up an incline, or if a shark has taken hold of the rear end of the truck, then the handles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> become heavier to operate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> When a player steps on the pedal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, if only one of the two players has stepped on the pedal, then the wheels on the side of the players&apos; truck where the pedal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has been pressed lift up. Here, the lifted state of the wheels is maintained for as long as the pedal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> continues to be pressed. Thereby, if there is an obstacle lying on one of the rails, for example, then that obstacle can be avoided by causing the wheels to lift up whilst the truck is passing that point. When the input to the pedal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is cancelled, the raised wheel returns to the original rail. In a situation where the two players press on the pedals <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> simultaneously, the truck jumps upwards in the virtual space, to a specified height. Obstacles can be avoided by means of this method. After the truck has jumped, the truck falls according to a specified force of gravity and lands back on the rails again. ps Structure of Game Device (1) (2) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows, the left and right-side handles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are connected respectively via motive force transmitting means <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> to left and right-side cranks <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which are designed in such a manner that they can be rotated in the same direction by moving the handles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> up and down. The left and right-side cranks <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> can be rotated (together with crank shafts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>) respectively about the same axis as left and right-side clutches <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and left and right-side principal gears <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, the cranks <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and principal gears <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> being engageable and disengageable by means of the clutches <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The left and right-side principal gears <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> engage respectively with left and right-side small gears <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> fixed onto an idle shaft <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. A large pulley <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is fixed to the idle shaft <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> coaxially with the small gears <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, in such a manner that it rotates at the same speed as the small gears <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the large pulley <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is connected via a belt to a small pulley <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and the rotating shaft of this small pulley <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is connected to a rotational speed sensor and brake, which are not illustrated in the diagram. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> microswitch for engaging and disengaging the clutches and levers <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> for operating this microswitch are provided in the operating section of each handle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. When a player takes hold of the operating section of the handle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> together with a lever <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, the microswitch turns on, and clutch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on the side that is being held engages. When the player releases the handle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the lever <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> returns to its original position, the microswitch turns off, and the clutch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> disengages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Next, the action of this handle mechanism will be described. In a case where the two handles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and levers <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> are held by players, such that both the left and right-side clutches <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are connected, the rotational force applied to the right-side crank <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> will be transmitted via the right-side clutch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, right-side principal gear <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and right-side small gear <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, to the idle shaft <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The rotation of the idle shaft <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is then transmitted via the principal pulley <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and the belt to the small pulley <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and moreover, it is also transmitted via the left-side small gear <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, left-side principal gear <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and left-side clutch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, to the left-side crank <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, if, for example, the left-side clutch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is disconnected and only the right-side handle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is driven, then only the right-side crank <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, right and left-side principal gears <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and small gears <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, the large pulley <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and the small pulley <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> will rotate, whilst the left-side crank shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> will not rotate. In particular, in this embodiment, by fixing the crank shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the side where the clutch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is disengaged (in this case, the left-hand side), the left-side handle <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is fixed and cannot be operated </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The handles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are able to swing upwards and downwards about a support section <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, and this swinging movement is converted into rotation of the cranks <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The motive force transmitting means <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> are supported at the lower end thereof by the cranks <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and at the upper end thereof by the handles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The range of the swinging movement of the handles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is restricted by the diameter of the cranks <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> This game device is modeled on a two-passenger truck, as displayed on the screen display section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and by providing two handles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> aligned in the same direction, it is possible or two players to operate the handles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in positions facing in the same direction towards the screen display section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, thereby making the screen display section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> readily visible to the players. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The supporting sections for the handles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are set in a low position, and consequently, the operating sections of the handles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> move back and forth about a central position which is higher than the supporting sections. Furthermore, the screen display section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is inclined in the opposite direction to the operating sections. Therefore, the screen display section <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> can be seen readily by the two players. When this game device is used as a one-player game device, the player selects any one of the two handles <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, and when he or she operates this handle, the truck moves through the virtual space under the drive of that handle alone. In this case, the handle that is not being used by the player is not coupled to the handle in use, since the clutch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is disengaged, and moreover, a brake (not illustrated) is applied to that handle in such a manner that it cannot be moved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, an electronic game device modeled on a truck driven by operating handles was used as an example of a multiple-player game device having a plurality of input mechanisms which are mutually coupled, but the present invention is not limited to this, and can be applied to a wide range of game devices, for example, game devices modeled on a multiple-passenger vehicle which is driven by a plurality of people pressing on pedals, or game devices modeled on a boat or canoe driven by a plurality of people operating oars or paddles. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the basic composition of a control device for a game device according to the present embodiment. The game device in the present embodiment comprises a game device control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, input device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, output device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, display means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and speaker <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The input device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises a handle, jump pedal and clutch lever, as described above, and it may also have a viewpoint change switch (not illustrated in the diagram). The output device comprises a brake <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, clutch <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and various lamps <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The display means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> consists of an image display device, such as a video monitor, projector, or the like. The game device control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a CPU (central processor unit) <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, as well as a ROM <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, RAM <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, sound device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, input/output interface <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, scroll data computing device <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, co-processor (auxiliary calculating device) <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, terrain data ROM <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, geometrizer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, shape date ROM <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, drawing device <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, texture data ROM <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, texture map RAM <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, frame buffer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, image synthesizer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and D/A converter <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is connected via a bus line to the ROM <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, which stores specified programs, and the like, the RAM <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, which stores data, the sound device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, input/output interface <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, scroll data computing device <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, co-processor <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and geometrizer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The RAM <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> functions as a buffer, and is used for writing various commands (display object, and the like) to the geometrizer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and writing matrices when calculating conversion matrices, and the like. The input/output interface <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is connected to the aforementioned input device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and output device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, whereby operating signals from the handle, or the like, forming the input device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are input to the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> as digital quantities, and signals generated by the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the like can be output to the output device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. These signals include various flag signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The sound device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is connected via a power amplifier <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to a speaker <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a sound signal generated by the sound device <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is power amplified and then supplied to the speaker <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> forming the sound output device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is devised in such a manner that, on the basis of a program stored in the ROM <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, it reads in operating signals from the input device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and terrain data from the terrain data ROM <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> or shape data from the shape data ROM <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (comprising three-dimensional data for &ldquo;objects, such as player&apos;s vehicle, enemy vehicle, etc.&rdquo; or &ldquo;background, such as path of travel, terrain, sky, structures, etc.&rdquo;), and performs behavioral calculations (simulations) for the truck, such as judging impacts (collisions) between the terrain and the truck, judging impacts between obstacles and the truck, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> This calculation of the truck&apos;s behaviour simulates the movement of the truck in a virtual space in accordance with the operating signals input by the players via the input device <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and after the co-ordinate values in the three-dimensional space have been determined, a conversion matrix for converting these co-ordinate values to a viewpoint co-ordinates system is supplied to the geometrizer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, along with shape data (for the truck, terrain, and the like). The terrain data ROM <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is connected to the co-processor <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and therefore previously determined terrain data is transferred to the co-processor <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> (and the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>). The co-processor <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> principally serves to judge impacts between the terrain and the truck, and it mainly undertakes floating-point calculations during this judgment process and the truck behavior calculations. Consequently, since impact (collision) judgement relating to the truck and terrain is carried out by the co-processor <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the judgment results therefrom being supplied to the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the calculational load on the CPU is reduced and the aforementioned impact judgment processing can be carried out more quickly. The geometrizer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is connected to the shape data ROM <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and the drawing device <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Polygon shape data (three-dimensional data for trucks, terrain, background, and the like, comprising each vertex thereof) is previously stored in the shape data ROM <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and this shape data is transferred to the geometrizer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The geometrizer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> performs a perspective conversion of the specified shape data by means of a conversion matrix supplied by the CPU <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, thereby yielding data converted from a three-dimensional virtual space co-ordinates system to a viewpoint co-ordinates system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The drawing device <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> applies texture to the converted viewpoint co-ordinates system shape data, and outputs the resulting data to the frame buffer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. In order to apply texture to the data, the drawing device <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is connected both to the texture data ROM <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and texture map RAM <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and to the frame buffer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Polygon data refers to relative or absolute co-ordinate data groups for each vertex of a polygon consisting of a plurality of vertices (principally, a three or four-sided shape). The aforementioned terrain data ROM <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> stores polygon data defined in relatively coarse terms, which is sufficient for carrying out impact judgments for the truck and terrain. The shape data ROM <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, stores polygon data which is set in more precise terms and relates to the shapes constituting the screen images of the truck, background, and the like. The scroll data computing device <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> computes data for scrolling screens, such as text, or the like, and this computing device <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the aforementioned frame buffer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> are connected, via the image synthesizer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the D/A converter <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, to the display device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the polygon screen images (simulation results) of the truck, terrain (background), and the like, stored temporarily in the frame buffer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> are synthesized with scrolling screen images of text information, such as speed, danger warnings, and the like, according to a specified priority, thereby generating final frame image data. By converting this image data to an analogue signal at the D/A converter <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and transferring to the display device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, game images are displayed in real time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Jump Processing (3) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Next, the processing implemented inside the computer of this game device will be described. As stated above, when a player operates the handle, the corresponding input data is read in by the control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a view of the players&apos; truck running along the rails is displayed on the display means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. If the speed of the handle operation increases, then the speed of the truck also increases and if the handle slows down, the truck also slows down. A flowchart for implementing a jump operation when a player presses on a jump pedal is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Firstly, if the control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has judged that a jump pedal input has been made by a player (step S<highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>), then it also determines whether or not both the left and the right-side pedals have been pressed respectively by the two players, at the same time (step S<highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>). If the left and right-side pedals have both been pressed simultaneously, then processing is implemented whereby a view of the truck jumping directly in the air, without leaning to one side, is displayed on the display means, the truck landing again after a fixed period of time (step S<highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if only one pedal has been pressed, then the control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> displays on the display means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> a view wherein the truck leans to one side and only the wheels on the side where the pedal has been pressed are raised in the air (step S<highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>). Here, if the control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has judged that there has been an input to the other pedal, before the input to the pedal already pressed has ceased (step S<highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>), then processing is implemented whereby a view of the truck jumping in the air whilst leaning to one side is displayed on the display means, the truck landing again after a fixed period of time (step S<highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> If the other pedal is not pressed, then the inclined state of the vehicle at step S<highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is maintained as long as the input to the previously pressed pedal is maintained, and when the control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has judged that the input to the previously pressed pedal has ceased (step S<highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>), then processing is implemented whereby the raised wheels drop down and the truck returns to a parallel course (step S<highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>), this image being displayed on the display means <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In order to carry out this processing, it is necessary, for instance, for the two players both to press on the jump pedals when they want to make the truck jump in the air. Moreover, if it is necessary to lift up the wheels on only one side of the vehicle, for example, in course selection processing as described below, then after the wheels which are to be on the ground have landed (after the player on the side of the grounded wheels has released the jump pedal), the other player must press the jump pedal for the wheels which are to be lifted in the air. Therefore, since a single operation is carried out by means of a combination of actions implemented by more than one person, there exist operations which cannot be performed by the actions of one player alone, and therefore the game device requires co-operation and teamwork in the players. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Shadow Formation Processing (4) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In this game device, the truck may jump above the surface of the ground (or water), and as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, if the shadow of the truck is formed on the land surface (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)), it is easier to comprehend the positional relationship between the truck and the land surface (whether or not the truck is touching the ground or raised in the air) compared to a case where no such shadow is formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, if the shadow is formed on the far side of the object as observed from the viewpoint (if the light source is provided on the viewpoint side of the object), then when observed from the viewpoint, the movement of the object and the movement of the shadow will appear to be the same movement, and hence the positional relationship between the object and the land surface will become difficult to understand (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)). Also, if the shadow is formed on the viewpoint side of the object (if the light source is provided on the far side of the object as observed from the viewpoint), then when the object is displayed in the front portion of the screen, the shadow may fall outside the screen area, and hence the positional relationship between the object and the land surface will become difficult to comprehend (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the shadow is formed within a region extending, from a vertical line between the truck and the land surface, in a horizontal direction (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>)) as observed from the viewpoint of between 45 degrees to the right front and 45 degrees to the right rear, or 45 degrees to the left front and 45 degrees to the left rear (hatched regions in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows a flowchart for implementing shadow formation processing using shadow forming means. The players&apos; truck is located in the front portion of the virtual space (close to the viewpoint) displayed on the screen, and it is progressing towards the rear of the screen (away from the viewpoint) along rails laid on a land surface. If a shadow is formed within a region between 45 degrees to the front right and 45 degrees to the rear right, or 45 degrees to the front left and 45 degrees to the rear left, then shadow forming means sets the light source (parallel light source) in a position above the truck, and within a region extending from a vertical line between the truck and the land surface in a horizontal direction as observed from the viewpoint, in other words, between 45 degrees to the rear left and 45 degrees to the front left or 45 degrees to the front right and 45 degrees to the rear right. The control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> calculates a shadow image on the basis of the position of the light source and causes this shadow image to be displayed on the display means (step S<highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> After setting the position of the light source, when a fixed period of time has elapsed (step S<highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>), the control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> judges whether or not it is still necessary to display a shadow (step S<highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>). If the display itself is terminated, because the game ends, or if there are dark areas on the course and the truck passes through one of these areas, then the control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> determines that no shadow display is required, and it skips the corresponding routine. If it is necessary to display a shadow, then the control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> checks whether or not the light source has moved outside the aforementioned restricted range (step S<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>). If it is within the aforementioned restricted range, then the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> returns to step S<highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, and waits for a fixed time period to elapse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> If the light source has deviated outside the aforementioned restricted range (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)), then the position of the light source is moved until it is in a position inside the restricted range (step S<highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>). Here, if, for example, the course taken the truck bends to the right without the light source provided in the virtual space having moved, then from a viewpoint positioned to the rear of the truck, the light source will appear to have moved in a leftward direction. If this causes the light source to move outside the restricted range, then it may be possible to restore the position of the light source by moving it to the right, but by so doing, the direction of movement of the shadow will alter course suddenly and may produce an unnatural effect. Therefore, in the present embodiment, the position of the light source is brought within the restricted range by moving the light source further to the left (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> If a parallel light source is provided in such a position and a scene is displayed wherein an object jumps up vertically from a flat land surface and then lands again, the object and shadow will respectively perform reciprocal movements in a linear path, and a viewer will be able readily to perceive the position at which the object and shadow meet (in other words, the position where the object lands) (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>). Consequently, it becomes easy to perceive the timing at which the object lands, thereby making it possible to provide an image processing device whereby such information is readily understood by the viewer when applied in a game device where an object must land before it can make a subsequent jump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Subsequent Jump Processing (5) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, once the truck has jumped it is not able to jump again until it has landed. However, whilst it is easy to tell if the object is in contact with the ground when the viewpoint is at almost the same height as the land surface (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)), it is not possible to see the point of contact between the object and the land surface when the viewpoint is positioned above the object, and therefore it becomes difficult for the player to perceive accurately whether or not the object has landed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)). Therefore, a jump input is permitted even when the truck has not landed completely, provided that it is at or below a fixed height. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing a procedure for implementing subsequent jump processing after the truck has jumped. In order to perform a subsequent jump, it is necessary for the truck to land first on the land surface, but in this embodiment, a certain tolerance is allowed in this respect, since it is not possible to perceive the positional relationship between the truck and the land surface precisely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> If the processing means recognizes that the two players have pressed on their respective jump pedals simultaneously (step S<highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>), then the processing device determines whether or not the truck is in contact with the land surface, or whether or not the height of the truck from the land surface is within a previously specified jump input tolerance range (step S<highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> If, as a result of this judgement process, the distance from the truck to the land surface is too large, then the jump input is ignored (step S<highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>), and jump processing is not carried out until a further jump input is made. If, on the other hand, the distance between the truck and the land surface is within the jump input tolerance range, even if it is not actually completely in contact with the ground, then jump processing is carried out (step S<highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> By means of this processing, a jump input can be accepted even in cases where the truck bounces to some extent, due to indentations in the land surface (or rails) (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>). Since the players may sometimes be unable to perceive that the truck is bouncing, this processing makes it possible to eliminate stress on the players, in a similar manner to the subsequent jump processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Obstacle Acceleration Processing (6) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> In cases where the truck is presented with an obstacle, if the obstacle moves suddenly towards the truck from a position in front of the truck, then since the relative speed thereof is high, the obstacle can be avoided if the truck is made to jump, or the like, with good timing. However, if, for example, an obstacle approaches the truck suddenly from behind, then the relative speed between the truck and the obstacle will be low, and since the time period for which the truck can be withdrawn into the air by jumping is limited, it is not possible to avoid the obstacle, even it the truck is made to jump with good timing. Also, if an obstacle is large and therefore takes a long time to pass, it will also be impossible to avoid the obstacle. Therefore, in the present embodiment, obstacles can be avoided by causing the obstacles to accelerate during the time that the truck and obstacles pass each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> shows a flowchart for implementing this obstacle acceleration processing. Firstly, when the player implements a jump operation (step S<highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>), it is judged whether or not there exists an obstacle which the truck cannot avoid making contact with before it lands after the current jump operation, on the basis of the relative speed of the truck and obstacle, the size of the obstacle, and the distance between the truck and obstacle (step S<highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> If there is an obstacle that cannot be avoided, then it is determined whether or not a collision with the truck can be avoided by accelerating the obstacle in question to a fixed speed (step S<highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>). The degree to which the obstacle is accelerated is set at the least to a level whereby the obstacle can be avoided if the timing of the jump is good, but it may also be set to a larger acceleration, depending on the level of difficulty of the game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> If it is judged that a collision cannot be avoided even if the obstacle is accelerated, then it is determined that the jump timing was poor, and this processing is exited without accelerating the obstacle. If it is judged that a collision can be avoided by accelerating the obstacle, then processing for accelerating the obstacle is carried out (step S<highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Timing Adjustment Processing (7) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> In the truck game device according to the present embodiment, a situation may arise where enemy characters cut down a tree standing close to the rails such that it forms an obstacle to the truck of the players&apos; characters. In this case, a fixed period of time is required from the enemy character raising an axe (first action) until the axe falls (second action), whilst the distance that the enemy character can advance within that time, depends on the speed of the character. Therefore, a problem arises of which position the enemy character should raise the axe so that it reaches a specified position (position where the tree is standing) when it falls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> shows a flowchart for the implementation of timing adjustment processing by an image processing device applied to a game device according to the present embodiment. Firstly, a fixed time period for the enemy character to perform the necessary actions, in other words, the period of time required from the enemy character raising the axe (first action) until the axe falls (second action) is read in from previously specified data, and this value is taken as T (step S<highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Next, the time period required for the enemy character to move from its current position to a position where it can carry out the second action (position where a tree is standing by the side of the rails) is determined from (distance from enemy character to tree by side of rails)&divide;(current speed of enemy character), and this value is taken as T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (step S<highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>). This value T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is then compared with the value of T (step S<highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>), and if the value of T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is greater than T, the value of T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is recalculated, whilst if the value of T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is less than T, (step S<highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>), then the operation starts (step S<highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> By this means, it is possible to display the necessary actions at suitable timings, regardless of the speed of the enemy character. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Difficulty Level Adjustment Processing (8) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In the image processing device applied to a game device according to the present embodiment, an enemy character may throw obstacles at the players&apos; characters. In this case, the period of time taken for the obstacle to reach the position of the players&apos; characters after it has been thrown by the enemy character has a significant effect on the level of difficulty of the game. If the image processing device adjusts the speed of the players&apos; characters, or the distance between the enemy character and the players&apos; characters, in order to match this time period to the level of difficulty of the game, then an unnatural image will result. Therefore, in this case, processing for adjusting the speed of the thrown obstacle is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows a flowchart illustrating how difficulty level adjustment processing is carried out by an image processing device applied to a game device according to this embodiment. If a flag indicating that the enemy character is attacking the players&apos; characters has been set (step S<highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight>), then the control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> calculates the position P that the players&apos; characters will reach after a fixed time period has elapsed, on the basis of the current position and speed of the players&apos; characters (step S<highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>). Here, the &ldquo;fixed time period&rdquo; is a value set according to the level of difficulty of the game, and if the difficulty level is high, for example, then a short time period is set. Furthermore, the calculation is carried out on the assumption that the speed of the players&apos; characters does not change during that time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> calculates the speed SP required for the obstacle launched by the enemy character to reach the position P after the aforementioned time period, on the basis of position P and the current position of the enemy character (step S<highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight>). The obstacle is then launched by the enemy character towards position P at this calculated speed SP (step S<highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In this process, it is assumed that the speed of the players&apos; characters does not change, and therefore if the speed of the players&apos; characters does change after the obstacle has been launched, then the period of time taken by the obstacle to reach the players&apos; characters will be different from the specified time period described above. However, since the time period from the launch of the obstacle until it reaches the players&apos; characters is short, for instance, approximately 0.5 seconds, the acceleration made during this period will not be large enough to have a notable effect on the level of difficulty of the game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Course Selection Processing (9) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the rails along which the truck is running may branch in places (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)), and if the wrong course is selected, the players may encounter unavoidable obstacles on the course and lose points. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), in this case, players select a course by making the wheels on the same side as the course they want to follow remain on the rails, whilst causing the wheels on the opposite side to this course to lift up in the air. This operation is performed by a combination of actions implemented by two players, as described previously. In the present embodiment, the processing load on the game device is reduced by implementing processing whereby the truck travels along the course on the opposite side to the correct course in cases where the players do not perform any course selection operation, or in cases where they have performed an invalid operation for course selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is a flowchart for implementing this course selection processing. Firstly, when the control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> judges that the players&apos; truck has reached a course junction point (step S<highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight>), it reads in input information from the pedals as the truck passes the junction point (step S<highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>). It then determines whether or not the combination of pedal operations is correct (step S<highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>), and if it judges that a correct operation has been performed, it implements processing whereby the truck in which the players&apos; characters are riding proceeds along the correct course (step S<highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> If, on the other hand, a correction operation has not been input, in other words, firstly, if the wrong course has been selected, or secondly, if no course selection operation has been performed (in the present embodiment, if both right and left-side wheels are in contact with the rails when the truck passes the junction point,) or thirdly, if no valid course selection is made (in the present embodiment, if the truck is in the air (jumping) when it passes the junction point,) then of the two courses at the junction, the incorrect course will be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Thereby, it is possible to reduce the players&apos; number of points by means of a predetermined program of a minimum size, without needing to implement processing for &ldquo;derailments&rdquo;, or the like, and without having to carry out new image processing operations, for depicting, for instance, a jumping truck crashing into a tree standing between the two routes at the junction point, and hence, the processing load on the control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is reduced and memory space in the ROM is saved. Moreover, since this game essentially involves two players working together in order to overcome adverse situations, it certainly does not detract from the appeal of the game if the truck is made to follow a course which inevitably causes the players to lose points if they do not act co-operatively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Points Reduction Display Processing (10) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, if the players&apos; characters suffer damage from the attacks of enemy characters or due to other obstacles, this is represented pictorially by depicting the truck gradually falling apart. Here, the type of damage corresponds to a number of points lost, and the remaining number of points after these points have been deducted corresponds to a picture of the truck at one stage in its gradual destruction. If the truck is completely destroyed, then the game ends, but before game over processing, a picture of the truck in a &ldquo;verge of death&rdquo; state is always depicted as a special image display indicating that the game is about to end imminently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> shows a flowchart for implementing point reduction display processing of this kind. It the control unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> identifies that the players&apos; characters have suffered damage (step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>), then it determines whether or not the aforementioned special image display has already been performed (step S<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). Here, the special image display serves to indicate that the players now have the minimum number of points remaining required to continue playing the game (for instance, 1 point), and that if they lose any further points, the game will end. Therefore, if any points are lost by damage received at step S<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the game will end immediately, and consequently, the control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will carry out game over processing (step S<highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> If the special image display has not yet been performed, then the control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> determines from the players current points score as recorded in the RAM, or the like, whether or not the players&apos; points score will reach the minimum level for continuing the game (1 point) or lower when points corresponding to the type of damage suffered have been deducted (step S<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). If the points score will fall to or below the minimum level, then the control section <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> reduces the players&apos; points score to 1 point. By using this points deduction operation, it is possible to prevent the game from bypassing the state where there is only 1 point remaining (special display state) and moving directly to game over processing, regardless of the type of damage suffered. If the players&apos; points score has been reduced to 1 point by the points deduction operation, then the special display image is output to the display means (step S<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). If the players&apos; points score after this points deduction is greater than 1 point, then a display corresponding to the points score is output to the display means (step S<highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>). In this way, by informing the players that the game is about to end, it is possible to advise the players to exercise caution, creating a feeling of tension in the players, who know that the game will end if they suffer any more damage. </paragraph>
