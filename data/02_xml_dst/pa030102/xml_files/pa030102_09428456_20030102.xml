<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Filed of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an image forming apparatus such as a copying machine, a facsimile apparatus or a printer, using an electrophotographic process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The basic construction of an image forming apparatus is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> of the accompanying drawings and the epitome of the operation thereof will hereinafter be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An electrostatic latent image bearing member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (hereinafter referred to as a photosensitive member) uniformly charged by a primary charger <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is subjected to exposure <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by image exposing means (not shown) for making image information into a latent image, whereafter the latent image is developed into a visualized image with toner by a developing unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A sheet P which is a recording medium is conveyed with its timing taken by registration rollers <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, and the toner image on the photosensitive member is electrostatically transferred to the sheet P by a transfer charger <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the toner borne on the recording sheet is fixed by heat and pressure in a fixing unit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> having a heating roller <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> containing a heat source therein and a pressure roller <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> urged against the heating roller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Also, after the transfer, some developer untransferred and remaining on the photosensitive member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is scraped off by a cleaning unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and is conveyed to a reservoir portion by a waste toner feeding member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and charges remaining as the latent image are eliminated by light of an eraser <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the image forming apparatus as described above, various problems arise when the temperature in the apparatus becomes high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The toner in the developing unit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is thermally deteriorated by heat generated from the fixing unit <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and image density is reduced by a reduction in the charging potential or the waste toner in the cleaning unit <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is coagulated by heat, and this leads to the trouble of the waste toner feeding member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A fan <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> for exhausting the heat from the apparatus to suppress the temperature rise in the apparatus is disposed in the image forming apparatus so that these problems may not arise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Also, near the exhaust fan, a filter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is disposed to prevent the developer and paper powder from being emitted from the interior of the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> However, by the long-term use of the apparatus, the toner and paper powder drifting in slight amounts in the apparatus and dust or the like in the air adhere to the filter and are accumulated thereon and as the result, they reduce heat exhausting efficiency and therefore, the inconveniences as previously described due to the temperature rise in the apparatus may be caused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Against the above-noted problems, there have been proposed a method of detecting the temperature and humidity in the apparatus, and effecting the control of a rotating speed or a capacity of the fan, or effecting such control as changes the area of an opening portion through which heat is exhausted, and a method of installing a plurality of fans at a time and controlling the respective fans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the above-described methods, however, plural kinds of sensors and fans and a complicated control mechanism are necessary and the problems of increased cost, bulkiness and noise of the main body of the apparatus are unavoidable. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide an image forming apparatus which has solved the above-noted problems peculiar to the conventional art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide an image forming apparatus which copes with even a temperature rise in the apparatus for a long period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide an image forming apparatus which copes with even a temperature rise in the apparatus attributable to the clogging of a filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention which achieves the above objects proposes an image forming apparatus for forming an electrostatic latent image on an electrophotographic photosensitive member, developing the electrostatic latent image and forming a developed image, and transferring the developed image to a recording medium to thereby form an image, wherein the image forming apparatus comprises: temperature detecting means for detecting temperature in the image forming apparatus; and control means for controlling a printing speed for forming the image so as to be reduced when the temperature detected by the temperature detecting means is a predetermined temperature T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Thereby, even when the filter is clogged by the long-term use thereof and heat exhausting efficiency is reduced, abnormal temperature rise in the apparatus can be prevented without spoiling the lower cost and downsizing of the main body of the apparatus and therefore, it becomes possible to obviate the creation of abnormal images and the trouble of the apparatus.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">First Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> represents a cross-section of a copying machine which is an image forming apparatus using a first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> uniformly charged by a charging roller <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is exposed to image information to thereby form an electrostatic latent image, which is then developed with toner by a developing device <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> By a bias being applied to a transfer roller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the toner image on the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is electrostatically transferred to a transfer material P supplied and conveyed to a transfer portion formed by the transfer roller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the photosensitive drum <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The transfer material passed through the transfer portion is further conveyed to a fixing device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, where the transfer material is heated and pressed to thereby fix the toner image on the transfer material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Any untransferred toner residual on the photosensitive drum is scraped off by a cleaning blade abutting against the photosensitive drum in a cleaner <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and is stored in the cleaner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The copying machine in the present embodiment has a process speed of 200 mm/sec. and an image forming speed of 30 sheets/min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In order to prevent the heat generated in the fixing device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> from filling the interior of the machine and deteriorating the toner in the developing device and the waste toner in the cleaner to thereby cause bad images to be formed, there is provided a heat exhausting fan <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> driven by a DC bias being applied thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Further, a filter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is provided on this side of the heat exhausting fan <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to prevent a slight amount of toner and paper powder scattering in the interior of the machine from being emitted out of the machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Arrows a and b in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> represent the typical directions of airflows in the machine created by the rotation of the heat exhausting fan. However, the streams of slight amounts of air exist in various portions such as a gap in the exterior of the apparatus and a gap in sheet supplying and conveying path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of the copying machine in the present embodiment as it is seen from the side <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a temperature sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is mounted on the rear side plate of the upper portion of the developing device, and when continuous image formation (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;continuous sheet supply&rdquo;) and image formation at suitable time intervals (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;intermittent sheet supply&rdquo;) were effected, it has been found that in the copying machine in the present embodiment, the detected temperature by the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is higher in the continuous sheet supply. It has also been found that in the continuous sheet supply, the detected temperature becomes constant, i.e., reaches a saturated temperature, by the supply of about 1,000 sheets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Further, the saturated temperature reached by this temperature sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> depends on the number of image forming sheets per unit time, and the smaller is the number of image forming sheets per unit time, the lower is the saturated temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When by the use of the above-described apparatus, the DC bias value applied to the heat exhausting fan was changed and the rotating speed of the fan was set to several kinds to thereby charge the airflow capacity created in the machine and in this state, the continuous sheet supply was effected and the saturated temperature of the sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> was changed, the following bad image was created when the detected temperature by the sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> disposed near the developing device became 40&deg; C. or higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> When the detected temperature became the above-mentioned temperature, the toner in the developing device was deteriorated and the charging ability of the toner was reduced, whereby a reduction in image density occurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> However, the bad image as described above is not created on the spot at a point of time whereat the detected temperature by the sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has reached the saturated temperature, but is created when thermal and mechanical stress is continuously applied to the toner still after the detected temperature has reached the aforementioned temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> When in an apparatus wherein the DC bias value applied to the heat exhausting fan is set so that the detected temperature by the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> disposed in the developing device may not reach 40&deg; C. when the continuous sheet supply is effect at the initial stage of the use of the apparatus, the work of effecting continuous image formation of 1,000 sheets, and stopping it for 5 hours after the detected temperature by the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has reached the saturated temperature, and cooling the apparatus to the room temperature, and again effecting continuous image formation of 1,000 sheets (this work is referred to as test cycle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) was continued, the detected temperature by the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> exceeded 40&deg; C. at a point of time whereat the number of image forming sheets reached about 100,000 sheets in the aggregate, and a reduction in image density occurred due to the mechanism as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> This is because paper powder produced by the sheets conveyed as the transfer materials and the toner scattering in the apparatus were sucked by the fan and adsorbed to the filter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and therefore, the filter was clogged and the heat exhausting efficiency by the fan <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> was reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Also, when the test cycle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> was further continued, the clogging of the filter progressed, and when the use of the apparatus was continued in a state in which the detected temperature by the sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> exceeded 45&deg; C., the coagulation of the toner occurred in the interior of the cleaner and the waste toner conveying member was damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> So, in the present embodiment, the control as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is provided to prevent the above-noted bad images and trouble of the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The detected temperature by the temperature detecting sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is defined as Ts, and a flow for controlling the printing operation on the basis of Ts will hereinafter be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> This flow is started by the main switch of the main body of the apparatus being closed and the number of printed sheets being designated by an operating portion (not shown) or the like, and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the printing operation is started (S<highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>), and temperature detection is started by the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>). Whether the temperature Ts thus detected by the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> during the temperature detection is a predetermined temperature T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or lower is judged (S<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>). In the present embodiment, 40&deg; C. at which a reduction in image density occurs is set as the temperature T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> When the temperature Ts detected by the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is not the predetermined temperature T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or higher, the printing operation is performed at an ordinary image forming speed (in the present embodiment, 30 sheets/min.) (S<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>). Thereafter, whether the designated number of sheets have been printed is judged (S<highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>), and when the designated number of sheets have been printed, the printing operation is finished (S<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>), and this flow is also ended. On the other hand, when the designated number of sheets have not been printed, return is made to S<highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> When at S<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the temperature Ts detected by the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is the predetermined temperature T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or higher, whether this temperature Ts is T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or higher is judged (S<highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>). This predetermined temperature T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a temperature higher than the predetermined temperature T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and in the present embodiment, the temperature T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 45&deg; C. at which the trouble of the feeding member is caused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> When the temperature Ts detected by the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is not the predetermined temperature T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or higher, that is, when the temperature Ts is between the predetermined temperature T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the predetermined temperature T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, control is effected so as to reduce the printing speed (S<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). In the present embodiment, this reduced printing speed was 20 sheets/min. The specific method of reducing the printing speed will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Thereby, the printing speed was reduced and the amount of heat generated in the image forming apparatus was reduced and therefore, bad images and the trouble of the apparatus attributable to the temperature reached in the apparatus could be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> When the temperature Ts becomes lower than the predetermined temperature T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the middle of the printing operation performed with the printing speed reduced, the printing operation may be performed with the printing speed returned to the ordinary printing speed. Also, in the present embodiment, when the temperature Ts was between the predetermined temperature T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the predetermined temperature T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the printing speed was reduced to a predetermined speed at a stroke, but the printing speed may be continuously reduced on the basis of the temperature Ts, or may be stepwisely reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the temperature Ts is the predetermined temperature T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or higher, the operation of the main body of the image forming apparatus is stopped and the printing operation is also stopped to prevent any trouble from occurring to the main body (S<highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>). Thereby, not only the creation of bad images but also the trouble of the main body of the apparatus can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A specific example of reducing the printing speed will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the ordinary printing operation, images are formed on recording sheets while the recording sheets are continuously conveyed at short intervals (continuous printing operation), but by lengthening the intervals between the recording sheets at this time, the printing speed can be reduced. When the intervals between the continuously conveyed recording sheets are thus lengthened, the number of printed sheets per unit time decreases and the amount of heat required for fixing decreases per unit time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Even when the printing speed is being reduced, the rotating speed of the fan <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is constant, and the rotating speed and the airflow capacity are not controlled. Also, design may be made such that a warning for interchanging the filter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is given as soon as the printing speed is reduced. The filter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is interchanged on the basis of this warning, whereby the continued use of the apparatus becomes possible without the printing operation being stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As described above, the temperature sensor is provided near the drum in the apparatus and the control of the printing speed by the detected temperature is effected, whereby such problems as a reduction in image density and the trouble of the waste toner feeding member could be prevented from arising even when the filter was clogged by the long-term use thereof and the heat exhausting efficiency of the heat exhausting fan was reduced. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, a temperature sensor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is disposed on a rear side plate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> near an airflow path d from a corona charger <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> toward a heat exhausting fan <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the corona charger <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is used as a primary charger. Also, the copying machine of the present embodiment has a copying speed of 16 sheets/min. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The corona charger effects discharge by applying a high voltage to a metallic wire of a small diameter, and causing a dielectric break down (puncture) of the air near the wire. By ozone produced at that time, substances contained in the air in the machine are oxidized and various kinds of compounds are produced. When these compounds adhere to the surface of the photosensitive member, these compounds absorb humidity in a high humidity environment and the resistance value of the surface of the photosensitive drum is locally reduced and therefore, the problem of image flow arises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> As a countermeasure for it, it is known to form an airflow path d from the vicinity of the primary charger <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> which is the ozone producing portion toward the heat exhausting fan <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and use an ozone filter <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> comprising a filter disposed on this side of the heat exhausting fan and given the ozone adsorbing ability. when the test cycle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in Embodiment 1 was repetitively effected in an environment of room temperature 30&deg; C. and humidity 80%, the detected temperature by the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> disposed near the primary charger and the image flow level were as shown in Table 1 below. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The detected temperatures by the sensor <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> have little difference between the durable numbers of sheets and have no correlation with the level of image flow. This is considered to be because the location of the sensor <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is near the fixing device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the sensor <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is liable to be directly affected by heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, the detected temperature by the sensor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> rises as the double number of sheets increases and is judged to have a correlation with the level of image flow. This is considered to be because the location of the sensor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is far from the fixing device and therefore the sensor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is hardly subject to the direct influence of heat and is liable to be affected by a reduction in the airflow capacity by the clogging of the filter, and is mounted near the corona charger <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> producing a great deal of ozone and therefore a reduction in the airflow capacity at the location of the sensor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> exerts an influence upon the level of image flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> It is seen that when the ozone produced by the corona charger <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is thus adsorbed by the ozone filter <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, the detected temperature by the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> disposed on the airflow path near the corona charger rises by the long-term use thereof and the level of image flow is aggravated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> So, in the present embodiment, provision is made of the following control conforming to the detected temperature Ts<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by the sensor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> When the detected temperature Ts<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by the sensor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is 40&deg; C. or higher, the interval between image forming sheets is extended and the number of copies is reduced from <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> sheets/min. to 8 sheets/min. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In the apparatus according to the conventional art, the detected temperature Ts<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> by the sensor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is 40&deg; C. for the supply of about 250 sheets. The image flow in this state is a level free of any problem. However, the detected temperature Ts<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 42&deg; C. for the supply of about 300 sheets, and in this state, some image flow occurs. When the supply of a greater number of sheets is effected, the detected temperature becomes 45&deg; C. after the supply of 500 sheets, and image flow and abnormal images by the temperature rise occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In contrast, in the apparatus having the control in the present embodiment, after the 250th sheet for which the sensor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> detected 40&deg; C., the copying speed is reduced from 16 sheets/min. to 8 sheets/min. The corona charger has a high voltage applied thereto and produces ozone only when the printing operation is performed and therefore, when the number of copies per unit time is reduced, the amount of heat generated by the fixing device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is reduced and the amount of ozone produced by the primary charger <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is also reduced. Thereby, even after the supply of 300 sheets, the detected temperature is suppressed to 40&deg; C. and image flow does not occur. When the supply of sheets was further continued at a rate of 8 sheets/min., image flow did not occur even after the supply of 500 sheets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As described above, when the ozone produced by the corona charger was adsorbed by the ozone filter, the number of supplied sheets was controlled based on the detected temperature by the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> disposed on the airflow path near the corona charger, whereby even when the ozone filter was clogged by the long-term use thereof, the creation of abnormal images by a temperature rise could be prevented and the occurrence of image flow by the ozone could also be prevented. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, there is a heat exhausting fan <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at a location on the deep side in the longitudinal direction of the main body of the apparatus and astride a cleaner <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and a fixing device <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and a filter <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is disposed near the heat exhausting fan <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Also, a temperature detecting sensor <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is provided on the lower portion of the cleaner on a rear side plate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and near a drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> When a transfer material once passed through the fixing device is used and is to be again printed immediately after passed through the fixing device (both-side printing or multi-printing), the transfer material contacts with the drum in the transfer portion in a considerably high temperature state. At that time, heat is transmitted from the transfer material to the drum and therefore, when continuous sheet supply is effected by the use of such transfer materials, the drum assumes a high temperature. The untransferred toner scraped off by a cleaning blade <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> remains in the portion of contact between the cleaning blade <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the drum <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to a certain degree, but this untransferred toner was softened by the temperature rise of the drum and was sometimes fused and bonded on the drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> When the ordinary printing operation is performed by the use of a transfer material of nearly the same temperature as the room temperature, the cleaner portion receives the heat chiefly from the fixing device from the exterior and therefore, the speed of temperature rise is relatively gentle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> However, when use is made of a transfer material which has once been passed through the fixing device and has therefore assumed a high temperature, the drum receives heat from the transfer material and therefore suddenly and locally rises in temperature and thus, it is necessary to ascertain the temperature rise more quickly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Table 3 below shows the temperature change of the sensor <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> during continuous sheet supply. Also, for comparison, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, a sensor <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> was provided on the upper portion of the cleaner on the rear side plate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and near the drum so that the amount of heat from the fixing device and the cooling effect of the fan might become substantially equal to those for the temperature sensor <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>, and the temperature change during continuous sheet supply was examined. The result is also shown in Table 3.

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The filter of the heat exhausting fan was a new one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Immediately after the continuous supply of 100 single side sheets, continuous image formation on 500 sheets was effected for each of both-side and single side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> In Table 3, the temperature for 0 sheet is that immediately after continuous image formation on 100 sheets was effected. Since there is no influence of the transfer materials upon the temperature, there is no difference in detected temperature between the sensors <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. Likewise, in the supply of 500 single side sheets, there is seen no difference between the detected temperatures by the sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when 500 both-side sheets were supplied, the sensor <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> detected 44&deg; C. and the sensor <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> detected 40&deg; C. It will thus be seen that the influence of the heat of the transfer materials can be more sensitively detected by the sensor <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> disposed near the portion of contact between the transfer material and the drum than by the sensor <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in the present embodiment, the image forming speed was controlled in conformity with the detected temperature Ts<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by the temperature detecting sensor <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> provided on the lower portion of the cleaner on the rear side plate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and near the drum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> For comparison, the following experiment was carried out in an apparatus wherein the control of the image forming speed conforming to the detected temperature Ts<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by the sensor <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> in the present embodiment is not effected. It is Table 4 that shows the detected temperatures by the sensors <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and the result of the fusion bond of the toner occurring on the drum when 200,000 sheets were installed in the apparatus and by the use of a durable filter, continuous both-side image formation on 500 sheets was effected immediately after the continuous supply of 100 single side sheets.
