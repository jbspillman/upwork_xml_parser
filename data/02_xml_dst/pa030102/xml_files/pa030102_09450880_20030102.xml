<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Throughout this application, various publications are referenced in parentheses by author and year. Full citations for these references may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application to describe more fully the art to which this invention pertains. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Normal bladder function requires coordinated bladder contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation during the emptying phase and the opposite, i.e. bladder relaxation and urethral sphincter contraction, during the filling/storage phase. The occurrence of irregularities in these processes increases with age in males and females and can lead to a variety of disorders of lower urinary tract function, including incontinence and urinary retention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Incontinence </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Incontinence is characterized by the involuntary loss of urine. It can be categorized generally into two types: stress and urge incontinence. Stress incontinence is characterized by an inability to generate or maintain normal closing pressure at the bladder outlet and urethra. Involuntary urine loss can be provoked whenever the physical stress of everyday activities causes intra-abdominal pressure (which is translated directly to the bladder) to rise above the level of the bladder closing pressure; hence the name. The underlying pathology may involve (1) damage to the nerves which send contractile signals to the urethra and bladder outlet (such as may occur during childbirth), (2) a decrease in the thickness of the urothelium after menopause, or (3) other processes which result in primary muscle weakness or loss of tone to these structures (Wein, 1987; Andersson, 1988). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Urge incontinence, in contrast, involves primarily changes in the function of the main body (detrusor) of the bladder. These changes may arise as a result of bladder inflammation (as in interstitial cystitis), secondary to bladder outlet obstruction (as in benign prostatic hyperplasia), or may be idiopathic. These changes disrupt the normal manner in which bladder volume/distention is sensed and translated into, first, the desire to void and, ultimately, the neuronal impulses signaling detrusor contraction. Rather than the normal graded response to bladder distention, patients with urge incontinence experience involuntary leakage preceded by a sensation of urgency and impending urinary loss. A large portion of patients with urge incontinence are shown by urodynamic evaluation to have detrusor instability, characterized by spontaneous, involuntary contractions (Swami and Abrams, 1996). The underlying pathology may involve the sensory or motor nervous systems innervating the detrusor, may be associated with inflammation and irritative processes in the bladder muscle, may arise secondary to chronic outlet obstruction from conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or may be idiopathic (Andersson, 1988). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Neural Control of the Micturition Reflex </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The micturition reflex is initiated by primary afferent A&dgr; and C type neurons which are activated in response to stretch of the bladder wall. These fibers pass via the pelvic nerve to the sacral spinal cord (DeGroat and Steers, 1990). Here they make synaptic connections with secondary afferent neurons which send excitatory signals to the pontine micturition center (PMC) in the brainstem. When activated, neurons of the PMC transmit excitatory signals back to the sacral spinal cord to inhibit sympathetic nerves responsible for maintaining tone to the bladder base and urethra, and to simulate parasympathetic motor nerves which contract the detrusor (Wein, 1987; DeGroat, 1998). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In addition to excitatory input from spinal neurons, the PMC receives various modulatory inputs from higher brain centers. Studies have shown that GABA (&ggr;-aminobutyric acid) dopamine, acetylcholine, and enkephalins modulate neurotransmission in the PMC (DeGroat, 1998). In addition, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), glycine, GABA and enkephalins also act at the level of the sacral spinal cord to influence micturition. Serotonergic projections from the raphe nuclei to the sacral spinal cord are thought to exist, since stimulation of these nerves inhibits bladder activity (DeGroat and Steers, 1990). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Current Treatments for Micturition Disorders </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A variety of pharmaceutical agents has been employed to treat micturition disorders. Drugs used to reduce bladder contractility associated with urge incontinence include muscarinic receptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers, direct smooth muscle relaxants, and beta-adrenergic receptor agonists (Andersson, 1988). In addition, inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis and tricylic antidepressants have been investigated for this purpose (Andersson, 1988). More recently, there has been an interest in developing potassium channel openers, aimed at reducing contractility by hyperpolarizing detrusor smooth muscle cells (Grant et al., 1994). Each of these therapies is associated with limited efficacy and unwanted side effects (Andersson, 1988; Wein, 1987). Furthermore, each of these therapies targets the motor component of micturition, and thereby has the potential for compromising bladder contraction required for the efficient elimination of urine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Discovery of 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>Receptor Role in the Control of Micturition </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The investigations leading to the present discovery arose from our discovery that messenger RNA for the 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor is present in rat spinal cord (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,639,652). This discovery led us to hypothesize that the 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor may play a role in controlling the activity of afferent sensory neurons and, therefore, might be an important target for the control of the micturition reflex by 5-HT or by agents which act selectively at the 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> To explore this hypothesis, the effects of 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>selective agents were investigated in an isovolumic model of micturition in the rat. This invention relates to the discovery that administration of selective 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>agonists produces inhibition of distension-induced rhythmic contractions in this model, and that this effect is blocked by the prior administration of 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F</subscript></highlight>-receptor-selective antagonists. This model of the urinary reflex is considered by experts in the field of urology and lower urinary tract function to reflect the potential of agents to modulate micturition in humans (see Maggi et al., 1987; Morikawa et al., 1992; Yoshiyama et al., 1995; and PCT International Application No. WO 97/31637). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The following definitions are presented as an aid in understanding this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Receptor Activation describes the process by which the binding of a compound to the receptor when it is on the surface of a cell leads to a metabolic response within the cell. Such metabolic responses include, but are not limited to, activation of adenylate cyclase, activation of guanylate cyclase, hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids, movement of ions across the cell membrane, or contraction in a tissue in the cells in which the receptor is expressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Potency means the concentration of an agonist which elicits half of its own maximum activation (expressed as EC<highlight><subscript>50 </subscript></highlight>or the negative log of the EC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>, i.e., pEC<highlight><subscript>50</subscript></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Intrinsic Activity means the magnitude of the maximum activation in a cell or tissue which a particular agonist is capable of eliciting, relative to the maximum activation elicited by a reference full agonist, and expressed as values ranging between unity for full agonists (e.g., serotonin in the case of 5-HT receptors) and zero for antagonists. Because intrinsic activity as originally defined by Ariens (Ariens et al., 1960) is recognized as being dependent upon the receptor system in which it is measured (Kenakin, 1987), intrinsic activity as referred to in this document is based upon measurements made using the cloned human 5-HT receptor systems described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Selectivity of Receptor Activation refers to the ability of an agonist to selectively activate one receptor relative to another receptor. Such selectivity may reflect either (a) the agonist&apos;s ability to activate one receptor at a much lower concentration than required to activate another receptor (i.e., a potency difference) or (b) the agonist&apos;s ability to activate one receptor to a much greater degree than another receptor, independent of concentration (i.e., an intrinsic activity difference), or (c) a combination of both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Therefore, statements of the form &ldquo;activates the 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor ten-fold more than it activates one of the following (receptors)&rdquo; mean and include any such difference whether it is by virtue of a difference in potency, or a difference in intrinsic activity, or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Having due regard to the preceding definitions, the present invention provides a method of treating urinary incontinence in a subject which comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor agonist which activates the human 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor at least ten-fold more than it activates each of the human 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1A</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1D</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>2A</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>2C</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, and 5-HT<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>receptors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the aforementioned 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor agonist additionally activates the human 5-HT<highlight><subscript>F1 </subscript></highlight>receptor at least ten-fold more than it activates each of the human 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1B</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1E</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>2B</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>5A</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>5B</subscript></highlight>, and 5-HT<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>receptors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> More preferably, the 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor agonist activates the human 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor at least 50-fold more than it activates each of the human 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1A</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1D</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>2A</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>2C</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, and 5-HT<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>receptors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the aforementioned 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor agonist additionally activates the human 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor at least 50-fold more than it activates each of the human 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1B</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1E</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>2B</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>5A</subscript></highlight>, 5-HT<highlight><subscript>5B</subscript></highlight>, and 5-HT<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>receptors. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments the 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor agonist also activates the human 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor at least ten-fold more than it activates any human &agr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>adrenoceptor or any human &bgr; adrenoceptor. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In still other embodiments the 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor agonist also activates the human 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor at least ten-fold more than it activates the human dopamine D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and D<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>receptors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In still further embodiments the 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor agonist also activates the human 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor at least ten-fold more than it activates the human &agr;<highlight><subscript>1A </subscript></highlight>adrenoceptor and the human &agr;<highlight><subscript>1B </subscript></highlight>adrenoceptor. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The data shown in the accompanying Table and Figures indicate that activation of the 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>serotonin receptor inhibits the micturition reflex. This in vivo property is recognized in the art as correlating with efficacy in treating urinary incontinence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The present invention therefore provides a method of treating urinary incontinence, which comprises administering a quantity of any of the 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor agonists defined herein in a quantity effective against urinary incontinence. The drug may be administered to a patient afflicted with urinary incontinence by any conventional route of administration, including, but not limited to, intravenous, intramuscular, oral, subcutaneous, intratumoral, intradermal, and parenteral. The quantity effective against urinary incontinence is between about 0.001 mg and about 10.0 mg per kg of subject body weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The method of treating urinary incontinence disclosed in the present invention may also be carried out using a pharmaceutical composition comprising any of the 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor agonists as defined herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The composition may contain between about 0.05 mg and about 500 mg of a 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor agonist, and may be constituted into any form suitable for the mode of administration selected. Compositions suitable for oral administration include solid forms, such as pills, capsules, granules, tablets, and powders, and liquid forms, such as solutions, syrups, elixirs, and suspensions. Forms useful for parenteral administration include sterile solutions, emulsions, and suspensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The drug may otherwise be prepared as a sterile solid composition which may be dissolved or suspended at the time of administration using sterile water, saline, or other appropriate sterile injectable medium. Carriers are intended to include necessary and inert binders, suspending agents, lubricants, flavorants, sweeteners, preservatives, dyes, and coatings. The drug may also be formulated as a part of a pharmaceutically acceptable transdermal patch. Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of pharmaceutical agents in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. (See, for e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,023,252.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily determined by those skilled in the art, and will vary with the particular 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F </subscript></highlight>receptor agonist in use, the strength of the preparation, the mode of administration, and the advancement of the disease condition. Additional factors depending on the particular patient being treated will result in a need to adjust dosages, including patient age, weight, diet, and time of administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;therapeutically effective amount&rdquo; as used herein refers to that amount of pharmaceutical agent that elicits in a tissue, system, animal or human, the biological or medicinal response that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which response includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease being treated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;subject,&rdquo; as used herein refers to an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, who has been the object of treatment, observation or experiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Cell Transfections </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Transient transfections of COS-7 cells with various plasmids were performed using the DEAE-Dextran method, which is well-known to those skilled in the art. Briefly, a plasmid comprising an expression vector for the receptor of interest was added to monolayers of COS-7 cells bathed in a DEAE-Dextran solution. In order to enhance the efficiency of transfection, dimethyl sulfoxide was typically also added, according to the method of Lopata (Lopata, et al., 1984). Cells were then grown under controlled conditions and used in experiments after about 72 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Stable cell lines were obtained using means which are well-known in the art. For example, a suitable host cell was typically cotransfected, using the calcium phosphate technique, with a plasmid comprising an expression vector for the receptor of interest and a plasmid comprising a gene which allows selection of successfully transfected cells. Cells were then grown in a controlled environment and selected for expression of the receptor of interest. By continuing to grow and select cells, stable cell lines were obtained expressing the receptors described and used herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Binding Assays </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The binding of a test compound to a receptor of interest was generally evaluated by competitive binding assays using membrane preparations derived from cells which expressed the receptor. First, conditions were determined which allowed measurement of the specific binding of a compound known to bind to the receptor. Then, the binding of the known compound to the receptor in membrane preparations was evaluated in the presence of several different concentrations of the test compound. Binding of the test compound to the receptor resulted in a reduction in the amount of the known compound which was bound to the receptor. A test compound having a high affinity for the receptor of interest would displace a given fraction of the bound known compound at a concentration lower than the concentration which would be required if the test compound had a low affinity for the receptor of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> This invention will be better understood from the Experimental Details which follow. However, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the specific methods and results discussed are merely illustrative of the invention as described more fully in the claims which follow thereafter. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Female Sprague Dawley rats weighing approximately 300 g were anesthetized with subcutaneous urethane (1.2 g/kg). The trachea was cannulated with PE240 tubing to provide a clear airway throughout the experiment. A midline abdominal incision was made and the left and right ureters were isolated. The ureters were ligated distally (to prevent escape of fluids from the bladder) and cannulated proximally with PE10 tubing. The incision was closed using 4-0 silk sutures, leaving the PE10 lines routed to the exterior for the elimination of urine. The bladder was cannulated via the transurethral route using PE50 tubing inserted 2.5 cm beyond the urethral opening. This cannula was secured to the tail using tape and connected to a pressure transducer. To prevent leakage from the bladder, the cannula was tied tightly to the exterior urethral opening using 4-0 silk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> To initiate the micturition reflex, the bladder was first emptied by applying pressure to the lower abdomen, and then filled with normal saline in 100 &mgr;l increments (maximum&equals;2 ml) until spontaneous bladder contractions occurred (typically 20-40 mmHg at a rate of one contraction every 1 to 2 minutes. Once a regular rhythm was established, vehicle (saline) or 5-HT<highlight><subscript>1F</subscript></highlight>-selective compounds were administered i.p. to explore their effects on bladder activity. In some instances, a compound known to affect the micturition reflex (e.g. the GABA<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>receptor agonist APMPA &lsqb;3-aminopropyl-2-methyl-phosphinic acid&rsqb;) was given as a &ldquo;positive control&rdquo;. </paragraph>
