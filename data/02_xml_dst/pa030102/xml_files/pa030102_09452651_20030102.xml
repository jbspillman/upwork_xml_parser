<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method and apparatus for detecting disk drive head instability. Normal head fluctuation is removed from the criterion used to detect whether a head is unstable. The present invention accumulates error signals in an accumulator and calculates a criterion having an average fluctuation removed using the accumulated error signals. The criterion is calculated according to (max&plus;min)&minus;(2&times;average), wherein max is the maximum error signal, min is the minimum error signal and average is the average error signal. The criterion is then compared to a predetermine threshold to determine whether the head is unstable. A head is determined to be unstable when (max&plus;min)&minus;(2&times;average) is greater than the predetermined threshold. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to a disk drive testing, and more particularly to a method and apparatus for testing head instability using a criterion that removes normal head fluctuation from consideration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Computer manufacturers have always worked to squeeze more data into smaller spaces. That mission has produced competing and complementary data storage technology including electronic circuits, magnetic media like hard disks and tape, and optical media such as compact disks. Today, companies constantly push the limits of these technologies to improve their speed, reliability, and throughput all while reducing cost. Storage technology has come a long way, and manufacturers continue to improve its speed, reliability, and throughput. Hard disks are the most common type of mass storage device today thanks to their low cost, high speed, and relatively high storage capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Most hard disk manufacturers today are concerned about system reliability. Further, computer users today have great expectations concerning the reliability of their data storage systems. Even though continual improvements in technology make data loss uncommon, it is not impossible. Yet, improvements in failure detection methods have led to steady increases in the mean time between failures (MTBF). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Of particular importance to increasing the MTBF is the focus on actively monitoring disk drive characteristics. For example, magnetic heads are commonly employed for the tasks of interacting with magnetic media for information storage and retrieval. A magnetic head includes an inductive coil disposed between a pair of magnetic poles. During the data writing mode, the current carrying coil induces magnetic flux into the magnetic poles, which in turn magnetizes a moving recording medium positioned close to the magnetic head. During the data reading mode, an MR read element utilizes the MR effect to detect magnetic flux emanating from the magnetic recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The MR head uses a thin film layer of ferromagnetic material to provide a high reading output irrespective of the relative speed between the head assembly and the magnetic recording medium. However, there is a possibility of producing a defective MR read element which can result in instability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a hard disk drive assembly (HDA), a general error measurement (GEM) circuit has been used in the read channel. The GEM subsystem samples raw data and stores measurement information, which may be processed or examined by the disk controller at a later time. In general, the input to the GEM subsystem is the difference between an actual sample and an estimated ideal sample. This difference may be squared and accumulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In prior GEM subsystems, a test failure criterion is used to detect MR head instability at the drive level. This test failure criterion is based upon the mean squared error (MSE) range. The MSE is defined as the maximum minus the minimum of the MSE readings of N times. When this range is larger than a predetermined threshold, then head is determined to be too unstable and is therefore identified as a failed device. Those skilled in the art will recognize that MR head is used generically here, and accordingly, MR head may refer to any type of MR head, e.g., anisotropic magneto-resistive (AMR) head or a giant magneto-resistive head (GMR). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The MSE range can vary even for stable heads because the MSE is always positive and its value varies over a range for different heads. Thus, normal random fluctuation of the GEM results can result in the miss-fire of the test thereby identifying a stable MR head as an unstable head. This causes a yield hit to the manufacturing of the MR heads that is higher than necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It can be seen that there is a need for a method and apparatus for testing head instability using a criterion that removes normal head fluctuation from consideration. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the following description of the exemplary embodiment, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration the specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized as structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a method and apparatus for testing head instability using a criterion that removes normal head fluctuation from consideration. Thus, normal random fluctuation of the GEM results will not result in the miss-fire of the test to identify a stable MR head as an unstable head. Accordingly, the MR head instability test is more robust and the hit to the manufacturing of the MR heads that is not higher than necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a rotary magnetic disk drive system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> suitable for incorporating the teachings of the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> plurality of magnetic information storage disks <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are journaled about a spindle motor assembly <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> within a housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Each magnetic disk <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has a multiplicity of concentric circular recording tracks <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, which are subdivided into sectors <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Data can be stored on or retrieved from the disks <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> by referencing a specific track <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and sector <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> An actuator arm assembly <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is rotatably mounted preferably in one corner of the housing <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The actuator arm assembly <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> carries a plurality of head gimbal assemblies <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Each of the head gimbal assemblies <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> carry a slider <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> having a read/write head, or transducer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> for reading information from and writing information onto the magnetic disks <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Transducer <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> may, for example, include a thin film head, an MR head or a GMR head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A voice coil motor <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is adapted to precisely rotate the actuator arm assembly <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> back and forth such that the transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> move across the magnetic disks <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> along an arc <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The disk drive system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also includes control circuitry <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> for processing information to be written to or received from the disks <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and controlling the position of the transducers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. For example, the control circuitry may include a read-channel as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a block diagram of a read channel <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the read signal <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is received by the automatic gain control (AGC) loop <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The amplified signal <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is filtered by a FIR filter <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to equalize the read channel&apos;s <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> frequency response to the proper partial response shape. The equalized signal <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is then converted to a digital signal <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> by the analog-to-digital converter <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The digital signal <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is then processed by the Viterbi decoder <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to reconstruct the original bit sequence written to the disk with a minimum probability of error as the data output <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> of the read channel <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A GEM circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> receives the equalized digital signal <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and monitors head instability. The GEM circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is configured to monitor the estimate error of the read-back signal <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. According to the present invention, the estimated error of the read-back signal <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> is accumulated at the GEM circuit <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> so that head instability can be detected according to:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(max&plus;min)&minus;(2&times;average)&gt;threshold.</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a block diagram of a GEM circuit <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the raw data <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, i.e., the equalized digital signals, are received by the sample processor <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The sample processor <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> processes the raw data <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The processed samples <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> are gated <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and accumulated <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention is not meant to be limited to any particular sample processing or gating. For example, the gating may be implemented with the capability to select a GEM window, a sample type, e.g., &plus;1, &minus;1, 0, all, etc. Furthermore, the sample processing may be configured to perform any type of sample processing such as filtering the error signal, producing an scaled error signal, producing the square of the error signal, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A controller <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> accesses the accumulator <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> to obtain the maximum estimated error signal, the minimum estimated error signal and the average of the estimated error signal over a predetermined period of time or over a number of samples. The controller <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> can then quantify the head instability according to whether (max&plus;min)&minus;(2&times;average)&gt;threshold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a block diagram <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of an exemplary hardware environment for detecting and quantifying head instability according to the present invention. The present invention is typically implemented using a computer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> comprised of a microprocessor. Memory <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is provided for storing data accessed from an accumulator for processing by the computer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> operates under the control of an operating system <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> executes one or more computer programs <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, under the control of the operating system <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Generally, the operating system <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and the computer programs <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> may be tangibly embodied in a computer-readable medium or carrier, e.g. one or more of the fixed and/or removable data storage device <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, or other data storage or data communications devices. Both the operating system <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and the computer programs <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> may be loaded from the data storage device <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> into the computer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> for execution as discussed below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Both the operating system <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and the computer programs <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> comprise instructions which, when read and executed by the microprocessor of the computer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, causes the computer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> to perform the steps necessary to execute the steps or elements of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Although an exemplary computer system configuration is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, those skilled in the art will recognize that any number of different configurations performing similar functions may be used in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a flow chart <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of the method for testing head instability using a criterion that removes normal head fluctuation from consideration according to the present invention. First, the minimum estimated error signal, the maximum estimated error signal and the average of the estimated error signal over a predetermined period of time or over a number of samples are determined <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. The criterion (max&plus;min)&minus;(2&times;average) is then calculated <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. A decision is made as to whether the calculated criterion is greater than a predetermined threshold <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. If the criterion is greater than a predetermined threshold <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, then the head fails the test <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. If the criterion is not greater than a predetermined threshold <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>, the head passes the test <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a plot of estimated error samples. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> minimum <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> and a maximum <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> estimated error sample are shown. From all of the samples, an average <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> is calculated. The maximum and minimum are added and twice the average is subtracted from the sum. The result is a new criterion <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>. If the new criterion <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> is greater than a predetermined threshold, then the test according to the present invention declares that the head fails the test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the prior methods, the mean square error (MSE) range, i.e., the difference between the maximum <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> and the minimum <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, was compared against a criterion. However, because the MSE was always positive and its value varied significantly for different heads, the MSE range itself fluctuates. But, by subtracting out the normal fluctuation included in the average <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>, normal fluctuations may be could removed from consideration in determining whether the head was unstable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In addition, because the normal fluctuation about an average <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> is equal, and the method according to the present invention will provide a new criterion <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> that is approximately equal to zero. The new threshold can therefore be much less than the threshold previously used because the measurement randomness has already been subtracted out. Accordingly, the change due to the randomness of measurement is separated from the randomness created by the head instability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description of the exemplary embodiment of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. It is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not with this detailed description, but rather by the claims appended hereto. </paragraph>
