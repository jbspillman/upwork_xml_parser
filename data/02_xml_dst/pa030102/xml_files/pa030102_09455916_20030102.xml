<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of presenting a portfolio and its apparatus as well as its system, and particularly to a method of optimizing the portfolio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As a method of optimizing a portfolio, a method utilizing an efficient frontier based on the &ldquo;portfolio selection&rdquo; has been known. An efficient frontier is a set of portfolios obtained by providing various levels of expected earnings as given conditions and minimizing the corresponding variance or volatility. For convenience such approach will be called hereunder as &ldquo;method of minimizing volatility&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In the portfolio selection mentioned above, the volatility is representing the concept of risk. However, from a standpoint of an investor, the fact that return is falling short of a target level is the very risk. A downside risk model, which is based on such a standpoint and is taking up the statistic of the Lower Partial Moment (LPM) or the like as a risk, is known. The method of optimizing the portfolio based on the downside risk model will be called hereunder for convenience as &ldquo;method of optimizing downside risk&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the method of volatility minimizing method and the downside risk minimizing method mentioned above, although they differ from each other in how the risk is grasped, they are same in evaluating the portfolio with two parameters of expected return and risk. Whichever approach may be employed, when a portfolio is configured with assets which are subject to price fluctuation in the market being taken in, it will be necessary to make a prediction of future market prices. However, unless the precision in the prediction of market fluctuations is very high, it will be questionable whether the optimum portfolio obtainable meets the expectation of an investor or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, when such a method of optimizing the portfolio is applied particularly to an investment of a short time period such as a few years, after a certain portfolio is selected out of the optimum portfolios obtained by such a method, the selected portfolio is operated principally by applying the buy and hold strategy, and then the asset universe is regulated or replaced in every fixed time period (for example, semiannually or annually). That is, a variance in profit status is covered by taking the change in the market during the operating period into the portfolio in every fixed time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The continuous application of the optimization in every fixed time period does not always realizes an optimization throughout the entire investment period, in general. In other words, there could be a discordance between the period of operation and a conventional optimization method, particularly in an operation for a short time period such as a few years. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The inventors of the present invention believe that an introduction of a new optimization method which maximizes the excess return at the time when the investment is completed is necessary, while countering the downside risks. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The present invention introduces, instead of forecasting market prices by points, a scenario configuring method, LMI (Latticing Method of Interest rate curve by historical volatility), which sets a space of price fluctuation, for example for market fluctuation of interest rate. By this, profit and loss may be computed for every price fluctuation within such space, and expected returns in the future can be grasped quantitatively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As an introduction of the LMI makes it possible to compute expected returns under various market price fluctuation scenarios, a set of such portfolios that will not go down below the given lower limit of profit and loss under any scenarios can be obtained in the embodiment by firstly using a linear programming method. Secondly, the optimum solution shall be computed using a quadratic programming for optimizing the expected returns in said set of portfolios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A portfolio optimizing method by the two steps optimization mentioned above in this embodiment shall be called MPMS (combining Multiple optimal Portfolios in Multiple Scenarios). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> This embodiment is based on the discernment that an improvement of efficient frontier as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may be expected, if assets having some of the properties listed below can be supposed to exist by fragmenting the holding period of asset universe: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> 1) Such assets exist earnings from which have different signs, and the volatilities of which are about equal at the same time; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> 2) Such assets exist volatility of which is low, even if their expected earnings are about equal; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> 3) Such assets exist volatility of which is about equal, even if their expected earnings are high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> For obtaining an efficient frontier, it is necessary to give expected earnings for the asset universe. However, it is difficult to precisely forecast the fluctuation of future market prices during the operation period all the time. Therefore this embodiment employs an approach of introducing a fluctuation scenarios of market prices and making a space setting of market price fluctuation, then reducing down to a set of portfolios having good earning characteristics within the entire space thus set, and seeking the optimum portfolio out of thus reduced set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> For a market price fluctuation scenario, two kinds of scenarios are configured from past market prices data, that is, a plurality of variation scenarios (basic scenarios) of market prices at a time the operating period elapses and a plurality of variation scenarios (path scenarios) of market prices during operating period. In this embodiment, a combination of the both kinds of scenarios is used as a market price fluctuation scenario, and a set of the all market price fluctuation scenarios is set as a space of market price fluctuation during the operating period. While how a scenario space is systematically set, in a more concrete sense, is a matter which should be decided according to the characteristics of the financial instruments to be incorporated into the portfolio, a setting of scenario needs to be made by a systematic method for eliminating arbitrariness to the lowest possible level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The portfolio to be obtained finally is obtained by two stages of optimization as shown below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In a first stage, such portfolio that will make a certain level of earnings or higher and at the same time can have the maximum expected earnings for every scenario is sought by using a linear programming method. Here, the condition of a certain level of earnings or higher for every scenario is important, and by this, a possibility of suffering a large loss by the portfolio to be sought is reduced relative to every fluctuation of market prices, within such scope that is assumed in the scenarios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As a second stage, such portfolio, that has the optimum portfolio for each scenario which was obtained in the first stage as the asset universe, is introduced, and the problem of minimizing the volatility of this portfolio is solved by a quadratic programming method, thus obtaining an efficient frontier. At that time, sample paths are made to be generated under a supposition of normal distribution of multiple variate using the past data of the market, then the average, variance, correlation coefficient for every one of the fragmented asset universe are obtained, then the variance-covariance matrix for portfolio, which is necessary for computation of optimization and corresponds to each scenario, are obtained separately by using the average, variance, correlation coefficient mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a system configuration of First Example of the present invention, which has configured the above mentioned embodiment in a further concrete form. That is, a computer system for computing the optimum portfolio and for presenting it to a customer in the First Example consists principally of a known type of workstations or high speed personal computers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As will be described later, for obtaining the optimum portfolio by a simulation, various kinds of data base are necessary beforehand, and an application program, which makes a simulation based on such data base for presenting to a user, is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> plurality of workstations are connected to the network. The server workstation has a data base application program for forming said data base installed therein. Data base is connected to this server workstation, and the data base prepared by said data base application program is memorized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The client workstation has a simulation application program which makes simulation of the optimized portfolio and a program which presents the simulation results to a user installed therein. At the server side, the server workstation and the client workstation are connected by a high speed path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The workstation at the host side is connected to a plurality of client workstations for customers through a network (for example, Internet) for providing services in response to requests from a plurality of workstations of clients. A workstation at the customer side is satisfied principally by having a providing application program installed therein. At the customer side, the providing application program should be able to have the user data, which are entered by individual customers (data for optimization guide incidental to that particular user), introduced therein, and make an output display of the optimum portfolio, etc. to satisfy its mission. For a customer who desires a high speed processing, a simulation application program is further installed. The reason for not installing data base at the customer side is that the data base is most important in the embodiment as will be described later, and such important data should be prevented from diffusion. For a customer who is known as exercising strict protection and preservation of data, a data base may naturally be installed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In each workstation, a simulation program and provided program are formed into a module, and whenever what fluctuation scenarios are to be used is decided, the parameters of such scenarios will be sent to program modules which need such scenario parameters through a known program interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Thus, the system of this embodiment satisfies the security, expandability, and maintainability in a compatible manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Now, explanations shall be made on an optimization of a portfolio having an interest (rate) swap as its constituent, based on the premises of a system which has an application program for setting data base, a simulation application program, and a providing application program of portfolios are installed into a workstation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>: Definition of Fragmentation of Swap </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> An operating period is expressed by T, and periods of M kinds of interest rate swap are expressed by m<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>(j&equals;1 . . . M), and the minimum unit period of T is expressed by &tgr; (here, T and m<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>shall be divisible by &tgr;) . Then, for M kinds of interest rate swap, a number n<highlight><subscript>j </subscript></highlight>(j&equals;1 . . . M) of timings when a interest rate swap is initiated and cancelled, where:

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Explanations shall be made with the following examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> For example, cases of interest rate swaps for 1 year and increasing stepwise by year up to 10 years are assumed, with operating period of 2 years, to which the following rules are to be applied: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> (ii) Interest rate swap of 1 year: After an elapse of 1 year, extra fund is rolled with LIBOR (London Inter-bank Offered Rate) (rollover). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> If the time of cancellation of a swap is every 3 months, an interest rate swap of 2 years (&equals;24 months) and over may be fragmented respectively into 8 kinds of swaps, and an interest rate swap of 1 year (&equals;12 months) may be fragmented into 4 kinds of swaps. For the time of initiation of swap, similar timing may be assumed. Further, since a swap has two phases of fixed rate receiving and fixed rate paying, when an investment period is 2 years, the kinds of interest rate swaps for which an investment may be made will be fragmented into 668 ways as indicated below: </paragraph>

When the short-term interest rate is assumed to have a possibility of 3 different ways of fluctuation of constant (no fluctuation), downfall, advance (ascending), and the long-term interest rate has three (3) possible ways of fluctuation of constant (no fluctuation), downfall, advance (ascending), the fluctuation patterns of both short-term and long-term interest rates will have 3&times;3&equals;9 ways of fluctuation patterns. A basic scenario is constituted based on such 9 ways of fluctuation. The width of advance and down fall of the interest rate may be set at two (2) times of the historical volatility, which is normally sufficient. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> A display is made in a display device relating to what expected earnings of the total fund can be expected under what price fluctuation scenario, when a fund is established by applying the above mentioned portfolio optimization method. As a display mode for such display, it is made as an example as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, if a size of an image plane of the display device permits. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, what is shown as <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is a display of a dialogue to designate what country the interest rate swap is to pass for obtaining an expected earnings in yen basis. Details of this dialogue is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In the example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, it is displayed that an interest rate swap quoted in U.S. dollars should be used. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a partial enlargement of <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. and this <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is a display area indicating the basic scenario of figure variation of interest rate of 2 years later.

<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Also, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a display area to indicate example of interest rate paths, and corresponds to the display area <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. As mentioned above, since this embodiment configuration is setting 3 different ways of scenarios of v&equals;0.2, or v&equals;1, or v&equals;5 against the interest rate path scenario as shown in the equation &lsqb;EQ&rsqb;, 3 different ways of scenarios are displayed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Also, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is an enlarged view of the display area <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, and this area <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> shows in a graph a fluctuation of interest rate of 1 month LIBOR for the data of the past 2 years. Similarly. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows an enlarged view of the display area <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, and this area <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> shows in a graph a fluctuation of 10 years swap rate for the data of the past 2 years. </paragraph>

Field <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> contains expressions indicating approximate figure of each scenario, <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> indicates a width of variation (2&sgr;) of 1 month LIBOR, <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> indicates a width of variation (2&sgr;) of 10 years swap, then <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> show earnings (capital gain) and yield in the period by scenarios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Second Example </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The First Example mentioned above permits a simulation to be made directly at an outside. Second Example is convenient for a case where a plurality of fund operators jointly own a fund operating system through one network (provided that the security of each operator is secured). But, actually for customers who are purchasers of fund, much of information provided by the above mentioned First Example is unnecessary. That is because a simulation requires complicated handling, of which many of such handling are not necessary for purchasers of fund. In view of this, the First Example may be so modified as providing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> only to customers and not providing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> (position table). The reason therefor is that from a standpoint of actual fund operators, a position table as final results of simulation is important, being different from a standpoint of a developer of a fund operating system who regards algorithm of simulation important. That is because, if a position table containing future buying and selling is leaked outside (particularly to market participants), competitors will find out with confidence specific positions to be taken by our side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the Second Example makes such customizing as changing various parameters in simulation depending on desire of a customer, but the simulation itself is done limitedly by the insiders (operator of fund). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> However, not providing a position table at all time could negate a trust in the effectiveness of this system. Therefore, a system is proposed in the Second Example, that although a providing of a position table is prohibited in principle, a position table is provided to a fund purchaser (that is to outside) only in a special case, provided that an authentication of the fund purchaser is made as much as possible. Such special case involves: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> a: Before a Contract is Initiated </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> A case when <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is provided for customers to confirm the effectiveness of the present invention by preparing a position table by applying this simulation for a certain time in the past as the time for initiating an operation of fund, and a customer making computation of profit and loss based on a supposition that buying and selling are done following such position table. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> b: After a Contract is Concluded </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> If a customer requests, positions in the past position of the operating period is provided to the customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> In the a and b mentioned above, the authentication of the customer to whom a position table is handed over is particularly important. Therefore, the Second Example has a dialogue and protocol for authenticating such customer (although not shown in the drawings, such dialogue and protocol themselves are known publicly.) The system of the Second Example further contains a dialogue to introduce a time of the above mentioned past time and duration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The Second Example having such dialogue can secure understanding of a customer as a fund purchaser of the usefulness of this system surely and at the same time efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> As has been explained above, the present invention makes it easy to optimize a portfolio in which the probability of obtaining excess earnings is enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> As many apparently widely different embodiments of the present invention can be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific embodiments thereof except as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
