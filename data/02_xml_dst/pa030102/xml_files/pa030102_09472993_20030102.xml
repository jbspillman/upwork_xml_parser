<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an exposure apparatus such as a semiconductor exposure apparatus of scan type, for example, and an exposure method and a device manufacturing method to be used therewith. More particularly, the invention is concerned with an exposure apparatus and an exposure method in which any influence of reflection light from a reticle or a wafer, for example, is removed by which accurate control of integrated exposure amount is enabled </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Scan type exposure apparatuses are known as an apparatus for manufacture of semiconductor devices, in which a pattern of a reticle is lithographically transferred onto a wafer through a scanning operation <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a schematic view of a main portion of an ordinary scan type semiconductor exposure apparatus. In this apparatus, as shown in the drawing, a portion of a pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> formed on a reticle <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is illuminated with slit-like illumination light <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, by use of a continuous emission light source or a pulse light emission light source. Through a projection optical system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, an image of that portion of the pattern <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is projected on the wafer <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in a reduced scale. On the other hand, the reticle <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the wafer <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are scanningly moved in opposite directions, as depicted by arrows <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, relatively to the projection optical system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the slit-like illumination light <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, at a speed ratio corresponding to the reduction magnification. By this, the whole pattern on the surface of the reticle <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is transferred to a single chip region or plural chip regions on the wafer <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In such semiconductor exposure apparatuses, in order to maintain constant the the integrated exposure amount of a wafer as determined by the image plane illuminance and the scan speed, the image plane illuminance has to be kept constant. In order to meet such requirement, in conventional scan type semiconductor exposure apparatuses, a photodetector is disposed at a position in an illumination system which is optically conjugate with the reticle, and an applied electric power to a discharge lamp is controlled so that an output of the photodetector becomes constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Such technique however involves a problem that, even if the control is made to keep the output of the photodetector constant, the integrated exposure amount of a wafer can not be made constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to investigations made by the inventive entity of the subject application in connection with the precision in integrated exposure amount control of a scan type exposure apparatus, it has been found that a major factor for degradation of precision in integrated exposure amount control is reflection light from a reticle to a photodetector which is placed at a position conjugate with the reticle surface, for measurement of the illuminance upon the reticle (original) surface. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In an exposure apparatus and an exposure method according to preferred embodiments of the present invention, a pattern of an original (reticle), as illuminated by an illumination optical system for illuminating the original with exposure light, is projected and printed on a substrate (wafer) through a projection optical system, wherein an output of a light source is controlled on the basis of an output of a photodetector disposed at a position which is optically conjugate with the pattern surface of the original. Specifically, any influence of reflection light from the pattern surface of the original is removed or reduced on the basis of an output of the photodetector produced as the pattern surface of the original is illuminated by the illumination optical system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Such exposure apparatus and exposure method may be a scan type exposure apparatus and a scan type exposure method in which the exposure is performed while the original and the substrate are scanningly moved relatively to a slit-like illumination light from the illumination optical system and to the projection optical system. The light source may comprise a discharge lamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As a preparation, while an applied electric power to the discharge lamp may be kept constant and while the scan motion may be performed at a speed lower than an ordinary scan speed, outputs of the photodetector in relation to each movement positions may be obtained. During this procedure, an output of the photodetector in a state in which there is no light coming from the original and directed to the photodetector may be obtained. In an actual exposure process of the substrate, initially, at start of the scan motion, an output of the photodetector in a state in which there is no reflection light coming from the original and directed back to the photodetector may be obtained, and then, at each movement positions in the scan motion, any influence of reflection light may be removed or reduced on the basis of the above output and the outputs having been obtained beforehand. Also, the output of the light source may be controlled on the basis of an output of the photodetector with the influence of reflection light being removed or reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as a preparation, while an applied electric power to the discharge lamp may be kept constant and while the scan motion may be performed at a speed lower than an ordinary scan speed, outputs of the photodetector and detection results of reflection light detecting means, for detecting reflection light from the pattern surface of the original, may be obtained in relation to each movement positions are obtained. In an actual exposure process of the substrate, at each movement positions in the scan motion, any influence of reflection light may be removed or reduced on the basis of an output of the photodetector and a result of detection by the reflection light detecting means. Also, the output of the light source may be controlled on the basis of an output of the photodetector with the influence of reflection light being removed or reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the present invention provides the following two methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Constant-Illuminance Designation at Reticle Positions&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A reticle surface illuminance detector may be disposed inside an illumination optical system. As regards a discharge lamp, in a case of constant input control, if the illuminance is measured in a short time such as several mSec. to several ten mSec., its variation is large. If, however, an integrated value in the unit of a few seconds is considered, it is relatively stable. For this reason, the discharge lamp may be lightened with a constant input, and a reticle stage may be scanningly moved slowly. The outputs of the reticle surface illumination detector in that period may be memorized. It there is no reflection light coming from the reticle surface and impinging on the reticle surface illumination detector, the output of the reticle surface illumination detector would be kept constant, regardless of the reticle position, If any variation is measured, it means that the change results from reflection light from the reticle. Therefore, in an actual exposure operation for a wafer, constant-illuminance control may be performed in synchronism with the reticle position, in accordance with a component with the variation based on the reticle position being removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Correction with a Reticle Reflection Light Detector&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A reticle surface illuminance detector and a reticle reflection light detector may be disposed inside an illumination system. As regards a discharge lamp, In a case of constant input control, if the illuminance is measured in a short time such as several mSec. to several ten mSec., its variation is large. If, however, an integrated value in the unit of a few seconds is considered, it is relatively stable. For this reason, the discharge lamp may be lightened with a constant input, and a reticle stage may be scanningly moved slowly. The outputs of the reticle surface illuminance detector and the reticle reflection light detector in that period may be memorized. If there is no reflection light coming from the reticle surface and impinging on the reticle surface illumination detector, the output of the reticle surface illumination detector would be kept constant, regardless of the reticle position. Practically, however, the output of the reticle surface illuminance detector may change slightly with the reticle position. Here, if there is a particular ratio relation between the variation in output of the reticle reflection light detector and the variation in output of the reticle surface illuminance detector, regardless of the reticle position, it means that the influence of reflection light from the reticle, fixedly impinging on the reticle surface illuminance detector, can be detected on the basis of the output of the reticle reflection light detector. Namely, in ordinary wafer exposure the result of measurement by the reticle surface illuminance detector may be corrected on the basis of the result obtained by correcting, with the particular ratio, the variation in output of the reticle reflection light detector, such that an accurate reticle illuminance can be determined. Based on this value, constant-illuminance control may be performed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the narrow-band i-line detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the narrow-band g-line detector <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are accommodated in the lamp house <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the operation made by a CPU (not shown) inside the illumination system control <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, after the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on and the discharge of the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> becomes stable, analog signal outputs of the respective detectors are picked up at intervals of a few mSec. These signals are digitalized by an A/D converter (not shown), and then they are stored into a memory (not shown) as measurement data. In parallel to the above-described operations the CPU continuously performs the following discriminations in regard to the measurement data from the detectors, having been stored into the memory </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> (1) Whether or not the measurement data of the detectors is inside a predetermined tolerable range; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> (2) Whether or not any variation in the measurement data of the detectors is inside a predetermined tolerable range; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> (3) Whether or not the ratio of the measurement data of the detectors is inside a predetermined tolerable range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> If, as a result of these discriminations, any disorder is detected by the CPU, an i-line lamp extinction signal is promptly applied to the lighting device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and, additionally, the disorder is signaled to the general control <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In response to reception of this disorder signal, the general control <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> stops the operation of the apparatus, and a corresponding alarm and display is presented. With the operation described above, the possibility of continued execution of an incomplete exposure process is prohibited. Also, damage of the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> (B) Correcting the arc shape of the i-line lamp: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Like the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment, a conventional semiconductor exposure apparatus includes a variable stop <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> having a variable aperture diameter, being disposed inside the illumination system. The arc of the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is projected to a portion of the fly&apos;s eye lens <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> corresponding to the size of this stop, while the arc size is appropriately adjusted by the zoom lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference>, the arc shape and size of the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is not always constant, due to differences in manufacturer, in article (manufacturing error), or in applied electric power, for example. Thus, with the conventional method, the light of the i-line lamp can not always be used effectively and stably. In consideration of it, in the semiconductor exposure apparatus according to this embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> CCD camera <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is provided inside the lamp house <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> so that the arc shape of the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be measured in a horizontal direction. The arc shape and size are measured, after the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on and the discharge thereof is stabilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The actual measurement is performed by use of the image processing system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. More specifically, in response to an input of an arc image applied from the CCD camera <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the image processing system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> determines a highest luminous point position in the image, and it detects the intensity distribution at that position along the horizontal direction. The intensity distribution may be such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference>. Subsequently, the image processing system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> calculates a half bandwidth (half width at peak) of this intensity distribution, and applies it to the illumination system control <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> as an arc radius value. In response to reception of this arc radius value, a CPU (not shown) inside the illumination system control <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> compares it with an arc radius value of a reference i-line lamp If the same is concluded as not being optimum, the control <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> actuates the zoom lens <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so that the arc of optimum size is projected on the light entrance end of the fly&apos;s eye lens <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment performs the above-described operation continuously. Thus, even if the applied electric power to the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and thus the arc shape thereof are changed, in the constant-illuminance mode, for example, an optimum arc shape can be projected automatically onto the light entrance end of the fly&apos;s eye lens <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> (C) Improving the durability of the narrow-band i-line filter and the high-speed exposure shutter: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment, the exposure light is provided as follows. Of the light from the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> having a spectral output characteristic such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, light in a range of <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> nm is extracted by using an elliptical mirror having a long-wavelength intercepting characteristic such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Then, by using the middle-hand i-line filter <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as depicted by a broken line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, light of a few tens nm bandwidth adjacent to the i-line is extracted. Furthermore, by using the narrow-band i-line filter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> depicted by a solid line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, light of a few nm bandwidth adjacent to the i-line is extracted. Thus, only light of a bandwidth range very close to the practical exposure light impinges on the shutter blade <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> or the narrow-band i-line filter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Since the shutter blade <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the narrow-band i-line filter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> receive only a smallest required energy, the durabilities of the blade <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the filter <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are prolonged significantly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> (D) Controlling the purity of the i-line lamp: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment, the electric power control for the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (conventionally, it is independent from a job) can be set from the console <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, in relation to each jobs. Specific examples for the electric power control method may be as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> (1) Constant-Input Mode </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Like a conventional constant-input mode, an applied electric power to the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is specified. While the purity becomes substantially constant, the purity measurement or the like is not performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> (2) Constant-Illuminance Mode </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Like a conventional constant-illuminance mode, an image plane illuminance is specified. However, since the applied electric power to the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is controlled so that the illuminance becomes constant, the purity will change. The timing for changing the applied electric power can be specified in relation to each wafers or each jobs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> (3) Constant-Purity Mode </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> This is a mode added in the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment. The purity of the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is specified. The applied electric power is controlled on the basis of the purity measurement, to maintain the specified purity. The timing for changing the applied electric power can be specified in relation to each wafers or each jobs </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The constant-purity mode in Item (3) above, which is added in this embodiment, will be explained in detail. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment is provided with a middle-band i-line detector <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> for measuring light of about i-line wavelength plus/minus 10 nm, and a narrow-band i-line detector <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for measuring light of about i-line wavelength plus/minus a few nm. Through the operation of the CPU (not shown) inside the illumination system control <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, after the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on and after the discharge of the i-line lamp becomes stable, analog signal outputs of the respective detectors are picked up at intervals of a few mSec. These signals are then digitalized by an A/D converter (not shown), and thereafter calculation of a ratio of measurement data of the detectors, that is, purity calculation, is performed. If the result of purity calculation is beyond a tolerable range set with respect to a predetermined purity, at a specified timing, the applied electric power to the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be controlled within the tolerable range for the applied electric power, whereby a target purity can be accomplished. If the applied electric power for attaining the specified purity is beyond the tolerable range for the applied electric power, a failure of continued exposure operation is signaled to the general control <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In response to reception of that signal, the general control <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> stops the operation of the apparatus, and presents an alarm and display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> (E) Detecting the reflectivity of the exposure shutter blade: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment has an exposure shutter protecting function, as has been described with reference to &ldquo;(C) Improving the durability of the narrow-band i-line filter and the high-speed exposure shutter:&rdquo;. However, the protection is not complete, because there is a possibility that any impurities are mixed into a cooling air for the shutter blade <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which impurities may be deposited on the surface of the shutter blade <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to cause a decrease of the surface reflectivity of the shutter blade <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and an increase of thermal absorption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In consideration of it, the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment is provided with a broad-band detector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, for directly detecting a wavelength in the same bandwidth region as the light to be collected by the elliptical mirror <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, as well as a photodetector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for detecting reflection light from the shatter blade <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Through the operation of the CPU (not shown) inside the illumination system control <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, after the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on and after the discharge of the i-line lamp becomes stable, and when the blocking plate <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are in its open state, analog signal outputs of the respective detectors are picked up at intervals of a few mSec. These signals are then digitalized by an A/D converter (not shown), and thereafter calculation of a ratio of measurement data of the detectors, that is, calculation of the surface reflectivity of the shutter blade <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, is performed. If the result of surface reflectivity calculation is beyond a tolerable range set with respect to a value, an i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> extinction signal is promptly supplied to the lighting device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Also, this disorder is signaled to the general control <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In response to reception of that signal, the general control <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> stops the operation of the apparatus, and presents an alarm and display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> (F) Detecting any deformation of the exposure shutter blade: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment, in connection with the exposure shutter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, detection of any contact of the shutter blade with any surrounding member is performed, in addition to the protection described above. This is because deformation of the shutter blade may be caused by, in addition to thermal deformation described above, incorrect maintenance by a user or a service person, an error in manufacture, or a mechanical damage during transportation, for example. In this embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the shutter blade <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is made of a metal material having an electric conductivity and, also, the blocking plates <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> adjacent to the opening are made of an electrically conductive metal material. These components are held in electrically isolated state, by use of spacers <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> of electrically insulative material. On the other hand, the CPU (not shown) inside the illumination system control <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> continuously monitors any electric contact between the shutter blade <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the blocking plate <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. If any electric contact is detected, an i-line lamp extinction signal is promptly supplied to the lighting device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Also, this disorder is signaled to the general control <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In response to reception of that signal, the general control <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> stops the operation of the apparatus, and presents an alarm and display. In this embodiment, in consideration of the difficulty of providing direct electric connection to the shutter blade <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, any electric contact between the housing of the AC servo motor <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and the blocking plate <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is detected. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment has a function for reducing astigmatism of a projection lens, to be produced during the exposure process. In this embodiment, at the stage of projection lens designing, a slit shape and as well as an illuminance distribution inside a slit effective to minimize the production of astigmatism due to execution of the exposure process are determined in relation to each illumination modes, and they are reproduced and accomplished in the semiconductor exposure apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference> shows an example of a slit shape and an illuminance distribution inside a slit, in a conventional semiconductor exposure apparatus. As seen from the drawing, generally in conventional semiconductor exposure apparatuses, the same illuminance distribution in the scan direction is defined at every points on the slit. Namely, substantially the same shape is defined at Sa, Sb and Sc in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>. This is to accomplish uniformness of integrated exposure amount in the slit direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Further, in some conventional semiconductor exposure apparatuses, the slit width at each points on the slit is made variable so that the same illuminance integrated amount can be provided in the scan direction. This is to accomplish uniformness of integrated exposure amount in the slit direction. In that occasion, substantially the same area is, defined at Sa, Sb and Sc in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> The semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment has a similar structure as of the conventional examples described above. However, it functions in a completely different way. In the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment, the slit shape and the illuminance distribution inside a slit can be set as desired. With this function, astigmatism or the like to be produced during the exposure process can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> shows an example of an optimum slit shape and illuminance distribution inside a slit, effective to reduce exposure astigmatism, in relation to a certain illumination mode. In the slit illumination as illustrated, in a lens close to a reticle or a wafer, the light energy density of the light passing through a portion about the lens center is lowered such that, within a region through which the light passes, there does not occur a large temperature difference between the lens central portion and the peripheral portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Production of exposure astigmatism depends on the reticle surface illuminance, the reticle transmissivity and the reticle average diffraction efficiency. In consideration of it, in this embodiment, measured values of them are also used in determination of the slit shape and the illuminance distribution inside a slit. Details of this will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a perspective view, showing the structure of a reticle diffraction sensor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, mounted on the &thgr;-Z stage <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The reticle diffraction sensor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> serves to measure the magnitude or extent of reticle diffraction in the scan direction. Denoted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> at <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is a slit of a width of about 0.3 mm, and having a length substantially the same as that of the exposure slit. Denoted at <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> are photodetectors. Here, the incident light energy upon a peripheral photodetector or detectors becomes stronger with more fine patterns included in the exposure pattern on the reticle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment, when a reticle <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is placed on the reticle stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> first time, the reticle average diffraction rate and the reticle transmissivity are measured. This measurement is performed under the same illumination mode as the practical exposure process (the same stop <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> in the actual exposure). Here, the reticle diffraction sensor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is held stationary at about a central position in the exposure light flux, and it operates to perform integrated measurement of the light energy impinging thereon during the scan motion of the reticle <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. From the ratio in integration measurement value among the sensors <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the reticle diffraction sensor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, the average diffraction rate being set is calculated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> During the measurement, the reticle surface illuminance detector <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> inside the illumination system also operates to perform integration measurement, such that, from the total sum of the integrated outputs of the sensors <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of the reticle diffraction sensor <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and the ratio in integration measured value of the reticle surface illuminance detector <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, the reticle transmissivity can be calculated. With the measurement operations described above, the reticle average diffraction rate and the reticle transmissivity are obtained. In the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment, just before initiation of an actual exposure process for a wafer, also the reticle surface illuminance is measured by using the reticle surface illuminance detector <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> With the operations described above, the reticle average diffraction rate and the reticle transmissivity of the reticle <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, being set, as well as the reticle surface illuminance under the illumination made being currently set, are detected. Thus, a slit shape and an Illuminance distribution in a slit, effective to minimize the exposure astigmatism, can be determined by calculation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> It requires a quite large number of calculations to make this determination. In this embodiment, in consideration of it, at the stage of designing, representative data for the reticle average diffraction rate, the reticle transmissivity and the reticle surface illuminance being calculated in relation to each illumination modes as well as the optimum slit shape and the optimum illuminance distribution inside a slit are prepared beforehand, and they are stored into a memory inside the apparatus control system <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. This enables that, through complementary calculation based on measured values of reticle average diffraction rate, reticle transmissivity and reticle surface illuminance, an optimum slit shape and an optimum illuminance distribution in a slit are determined easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Once the optimum slit shape and optimum illuminance distribution inside a slit are determined, corresponding data is supplied from the apparatus control system <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to the illumination system control <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. In response, the illumination system control <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> actuates the motors <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> for the variable slit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, by which an optimum slit shape is defined. Also, through actuation of the motor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the second zoom lens <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, an optimum illuminance distribution inside a slit can be accomplished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> After the operation described above, in the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment, the reticle stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is moved to move a transparent dummy reticle <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> into the illumination region. Then, by using the illuminance non-uniformness detector <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the accomplishment of the optimum slit shape and the optimum illuminance distribution in a slit is measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The illuminance non-uniformness detector <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> comprises a linear CCD sensor having a long measurement range in the scan direction. It is moved to the image plane position, where it measures the light energy distribution at a single point on the slit, along the scan direction. Thereafter, similar measurement is performed at plural points on the slit, to check the accomplishment of the optimum value. If there is an error found, fine adjustment of the variable slit <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and/or the second zoom lens <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As a matter of course, for uniforming the integrated exposure amount along the scan direction, the light energy distribution in the scan direction thus accomplished provides the same value at any slit position, when integrated in the scan direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> After the above-described setting operations are completed, the reticle stage is moved back to the scan start position. Then, the reticle reflection light measurement for &ldquo;(H) High-precision control of integrated exposure amount&rdquo; to be described below, starts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, for further minimization of a change of exposure astigmatism, even during the exposure process the total energy applied to the projection lens <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is calculated from the output value of the photodetector <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and the reticle transmission factor, and fine adjustment of the optimum slit illumination shape and optimum light energy distribution is performed automatically during the exposure process. Further, in the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment, the microscope <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is inserted into the exposure region at regular time intervals, and longitudinal and lateral patterns on the reference mark block mounted on the &thgr;-Z stage <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> are measured by using the CCD camera <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. On the basis of it, whether the exposure astigmatism is held within the tolerable range can be checked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> (H) High-precision control of integrated exposure amount: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment, after the slit shape and the illuminance distribution inside a slit are determined, for &ldquo;(G) Reducing astigmatism aberration&rdquo; described above, reticle reflection light measurement necessary for performing integrated exposure amount control at a high precision, starts. The reticle reflection light measurement and an actual exposure operation will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> (1) From the illumination system control <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, an energization signal to be supplied to the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is applied to the lighting device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The lighting device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> supplies the power to the i-line lamp <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> (2) Subsequently, the reticle stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is moved to the scan start position. A measured value of the reticle surface illuminance detector <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> at that time is memorized as a reference illuminance. Here, the structure is arranged so that, it the reticle stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is at the scan start position, the light from the illumination system does not return back to the illumination system. Namely, it is in the state that any reticle reflection light does not at all return to the reticle illuminance detector <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> (3) The reticle stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is scanningly moved throughout the whole exposure region, at a speed sufficiently slower than that in an ordinary exposure process. The measured values of the reticle surface illuminance detector <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> at each reticle positions, are stored into a memory inside the illumination system control <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> (4) The CPU inside the illumination system control <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> performs subtraction of the measured value, having been measured at step (2) above, from the measured values of the reticle surface illuminance detector <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> in relation to the different positions of the reticle. The results are stored into the memory in relation to the reticle positions, respectively, as reticle reflection measured values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> (5) After completion of the measurements described above, an actual wafer exposure process starts in the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment. In the actual wafer exposure process, first, in parallel to wafer loading, an operation similar to Item (2) above is executed, and a current reticle surface illuminance is measured. From this reticle surface illuminance, the scan speed necessary for attaining a desired exposure amount is determined. Also, the ratio between the reticle surface illuminance and the reference illuminance, having been determined at step (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), is calculated. From this ratio, correction for the reticle reflection light measured value having been detected at step (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) is calculated. The result is stored into the memory, in relation to each reticle positions, as a current reticle reflection light measured value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> (6) After the operations described above, in the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment, processes such as prealignment measurement, fine alignment measurement and focus measurement, for example, are performed. Thereafter, the scan exposure operation starts, such that the reticle <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the wafer <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are scanningly moved in opposite directions, as depicted by an arrow illustrated, at a speed ratio corresponding to the reduction ratio of the projection system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, whereby the whole pattern on the reticle <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> surface is transferred to a single chip region on the wafer <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> (7) As the scan exposure operation stars and when the stages come just close to the exposure region, the high-speed exposure shutter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> (8) As the high-speed exposure shutter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is opened, measurement of the reticle surface illuminance through the reticle surface illuminance detector <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is enabled. Here, in the semiconductor exposure apparatus of this embodiment, the measured value of the reticle surface illuminance detector <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is not taken as the reticle surface illuminance. Rather, a value obtainable by subtracting, from this measured value, the reticle reflection light measured value at each current reticle positions, is taken as the reticle surface illuminance. The electric power control with the lighting device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is made so that the thus determined value is constantly registered with the current reticle surface illuminance having been memorized at step (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). This operation is continued, during the scan exposure operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> (9) When the scan exposure operation is completed, the power specifying signal to the lighting device <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is held fixed at an applied power value, as specified at step (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), and the high-speed exposure shutter <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> With the operations described above, an exposure process for one shot is completed. By repeating similar operations, scan exposure of the whole wafer surface is accomplished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> &lsqb;Modified Form&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The above-described embodiment may be modified as follows, for example: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> (1) A method based on &ldquo;correction with the reticle reflection light detector <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&rdquo; has has been described in the introductory part of the specification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> (2) If the reticle transmissivity is high and the wafer reflectivity is high, there may be cases in which the influence of reflection light from a wafer appears on the reticle surface illuminance detector <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. In that occasion, the method described with reference to the above embodiment may be done similarly, while a reflection plate having substantially the same reflection factor as of an actual wafer is disposed at the wafer position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> (3) While the above-described embodiment uses continuous light, the present invention is easily applicable to a semiconductor exposure apparatus using a pulse light source such as an excimer laser, for example. </paragraph>
