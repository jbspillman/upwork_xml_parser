<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method for producing screening and humidifying panels in particular for avicultural facilities or greenhouses and a panel produced by this procedure and equipment for this method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the field there are known honeycombed panels with channels extending between the two faces of the panel to allow air passage. There are predominantly two types of panels, to wit screening panels in which the channels are provided so as not to have the two ends aligned and thus prevent or reduce light inlet, and humidifying panels in which are made passages between the channels to permit continuous falling of a water veil to humidify the air passing through the channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Screening panels can be made of any material and in general plastic is preferred so as to press easily the channels with the necessary non-rectilinear configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Humidifying panels require to be made from moderately absorbent and porous materials to obtain a moist surface as broad as possible in contact with the air. The preferred material is impregnated cardboard which has been found to give the best characteristics in the particular application. Panels are accordingly made from glued cardboard layers appropriately undulated to form air channels and water passages. Unfortunately, by the known techniques it is impossible to make undulated cardboard with non-rectilinear undulations. For this reason the channels of the panels made in this manner are also rectilinear and it is accordingly impossible to make humidifying panels having screening properties also. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another problem is that the undulations can be produced continuously only in a direction near the transversal direction of the cardboard strip. This prevents obtaining panels having the inclinations which would be preferable for a more uniform distribution of the water veil. In addition the undulated cardboard layers forming the water passages should have the undulations with extension nearly right above the panel. Such a direction is however also that of maximum transversal extension of the panel. Since the extension of the cardboard in the direction parallel to the undulations coincides with the transversal extension of the cardboard strip during production of the undulations it is difficult and costly to make larger panels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The general purpose of the present invention is to remedy the above mentioned shortcomings by making available a production method which would make it possible to obtain cardboard panels with both screening and humidifying functions and in addition with the humidifying function incremented with respect to that of the prior art panels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Again in accordance with the purposes of the present invention there is supplied a panel made in accordance with said method and tools for the method. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In view of this purpose it was sought to provide in accordance with the present invention a process for manufacturing screening and humidifying panels in particular for avicultural facilities or greenhouses comprising the steps of shaping the cardboard sheets with non-rectilinear undulated channels by means of sequential pressing of the individual channels and gluing together of the sheets arranged with alternating different mutual inclination of the channels. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> With reference to the FIGS a panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is made up of a plurality of layers of sheets <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of cardboard impregnated e.g. with resin and glued together. Each sheet has shaped on it channels or undulations <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As may be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> each of the channels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has end sections <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which are near the edges of the sheet which coincide with the two faces <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for inlet &amp; outlet of air into or from the panel. The sections <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are basically at a right angle to the sheet edges and are connected by a section of channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> inclined so that the mouths of the channels are not in view of each other along the channel axis. The screening function is obtained in this manner. The angle &agr; can be e.g. around 130&deg;. The undulations can have a height of approximately 7 mm and the distance d between the crests can be approximately 21 mm. As may be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> neighboring sheets (indicated in the FIG by reference numbers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) are arranged overturned with respect to each other so that the channels on the two sheets have opposing inclinations. The contact points between the channel crests of the two sheets are glued to form the panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In this manner there are obtained channels for conveying the air between the faces <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the panel and the passages <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which connect the air conveyance channels together and extend between the upper and lower faces <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the panel. From the upper face water can thus be inlet to form a veil over all the walls of the sheets. The air humidification function is obtained thus. Thanks to the peculiar form of the channels distribution uniformity and exchange efficiency are much higher than those of conventional panels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> To be able to deform the cardboard to obtain the channels it has been found necessary to press the undulations on each sheet in sequence starting from one end. This is necessary to allow the cardboard to deform without tearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows diagrammatically a heated press <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which obtains that. It comprises a base equipped with a die <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> reproducing the form to be obtained on the cardboard and a segmented moving die <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with each segment <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> defining a channel. The segments are operated by actuators <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (only one is shown) to be able to descend on the die <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in sequence starting from one end to reach the other end of the press. Once all the segments have descended the press can remain closed for the time necessary for permanent deformation of the cardboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a possible alternative embodiment of a press in accordance with the present invention. A press <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> comprises a base with a die <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> reproducing the form to be obtained on the cardboard. The upper movable press table <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> supports a segmented movable die <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in which each segment <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is connected to the upper table <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> through an elastically yielding member <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>, e.g. a spring. The segments <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are arranged at a growing distance from the table <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> starting from one end and moving towards the other end of the undulated table. In this manner, upon operation of the press the segments <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> close sequentially on the table <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to deform the cardboard sheet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The elastic members are chosen to have sufficient elastic force to produce the correct compression of the cardboard without obstructing press closing. With a single command it is thus possible to obtain sequential deformation of the sheet <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The initial profile of the cardboard sheet to be shaped must allow for the deformation produced by the press. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows how the sheet should have a lozenge form <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to become rectangular after forming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Surprisingly it has been found that the sequential forming permits deformation in accordance with non-rectilinear undulations without tearing the cardboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is now clear that the predetermined purposes have been achieved by making available a production method and a panel allowing obtaining both the screening function and the humidifying function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Naturally the above description of an embodiment applying the innovative principles of the present invention is given by way of non-limiting example of said principles within the scope of the exclusive right claimed here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> For example the extension of the panel in all directions and the number of component layers will vary depending on specific requirements. The sheet forming process can also be accomplished by steps with a continuous strip of cardboard extending directly in the direction of greatest contraction caused by the forming as shown in broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The sheets will be trimmed after forming. The configuration of the channels can be different than shown while preserving the screening characteristics. For example <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a panel layer indicated by reference number <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> having channels with initial and final parts <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> inclined in matching manner and the central part <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> at a right angle to the air inlet-outlet edge. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows another embodiment of a layer <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> in which the channels have initial and final parts <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> inclined in opposite direction and the central part <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> at a right angle to the air inlet and outlet edge. Both embodiments can be pressed by the method in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
