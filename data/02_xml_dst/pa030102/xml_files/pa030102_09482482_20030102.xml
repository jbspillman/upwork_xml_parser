<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a current and/or voltage transformer comprising at least one primary circuit and one secondary circuit and more particularly to a transformer which, through its configurable character, can be used in several different electrical supplies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As a function of the parameters of the supply (topology, input voltages, output voltages, chopping frequency etc.) the variable parameters of this transformer can be configured so as to tailor the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; transformer to this specific application. These variable parameters are: the number of windings, the number of turns per winding and also their resistance. These latter are configurable over a range of discrete values depending on the design of tile transformer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Customarily, each supply has its specific transformer. The number of windings as well as the number of turns and the resistance value of each winding are determined so as to cater for the particular function. The transformer is totally unadaptable and consequently virtually dedicated to this supply. With each supply, a specific transformer must be designed, engineered and produced. The same is true for the inductor which is a particular case of the transformer. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The objective of this invention is to produce a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; transformer which can be configured as a function of the parameters of the supply in which it is intended to be mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The transformer according to the invention comprises m elementary windings each having Ni turns, i being an integer number lying between 1 and a predetermined integer number n, m and Ni being integer numbers, said elementary windings being capable of being associated in series and/or in parallel in such a way as to produce a particular configuration from among a plurality of distinct configurations of primary circuits and of secondary circuits, each of said configurations corresponding to previously fixed electrical and magnetic parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thus, during the design of a supply, the design of the transformer is replaced by a simple configuration of the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; product. A single product is to be engineered and to be manufactured, thereby considerably reducing the cost of the magnetic components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Preferably, said groups of elementary windings are constituted by a multilayer printed circuit block exhibiting a sandwich structure constituted by superposing a plurality of layers of copper arranged between two semi-ferrites forming the magnetic circuit of the transformer, said layers being separated by insulating layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred characteristic of the invention, the electrical connections between the groups of elementary windings are etched on the printed circuit intended to receive the transformer.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the transformer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is composed of m windings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> each having Ni turns, i being a natural integer lying between 1 and a predetermined integer number n defining a family of windings of Ni turns, m and Ni being natural integers. These windings are intended to constitute at least one primary circuit P and at least one secondary circuit S of the transformer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The windings of each group are referred to as elementary windings in the subsequent description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The elementary windings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are capable of being associated in series and/or in parallel in such a way as to produce a particular configuration from among a plurality of distinct configurations of primary circuits and of secondary circuits. Each of said configurations corresponding to previously fixed electrical and magnetic parameters in respect of the transformer to be produced. The number of configurations depends on m and on the family of the Ni windings. For example, by connecting two windings with respectively two and three turns in series, a single winding with five turns is obtained. Likewise, by connecting in parallel two windings with three turns having respective resistances R and R&prime;, a single winding with three turns and resistance R*R&prime;/(R&plus;R&prime;) is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A group of elementary windings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can be composed of one to m&minus;1 elementary windings, terminals included. It follows that the number of windings of the configured transformer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> lies between 2 and m (terminals included) depending on the configuration chosen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> According to a particular application of the invention, when the number of windings is equal to 1, an induction coil is obtained, comprising a main winding, constituted by associating in series and/or parallel at least two elementary windings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> each having a determined number of turns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> According to an important characteristic of the invention, the electrical and/or magnetic parameters of said transformer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and of the induction coil are configurable through choice of the number and of the mode of association of the elementary windings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Thus, the number of turns of each group of elementary windings is configured through: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> the number of elementary windings of this group, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> the respective number of turns of each elementary winding, and through </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> the nature of the various connections between these elementary windings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The number of turns of a group of elementary windings of the transformer lies between Inf. (Ni) and &Sgr; Ni. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> By configuring the number of turns of the windings, the transformation ratio is configured since it is equal to the ratio of the numbers of turns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The resistance of each group of windings <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is configured through: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> the number of elementary windings of this group, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> the resistance of each elementary winding, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> the nature of the various connections between these elementary windings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The resistances of the windings of the configured transformer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> ran be calculated on the basis of the resistances of the elementary windings with the aid of the laws of physics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary application in which: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> m&equals;12 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> N<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;N<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&equals;N<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&equals;N<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>&equals;N<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>&equals;3 </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> By assuming in this example that the resistances of the windings with three turns are identical and equal to 70 &OHgr; and that the resistances of the windings with one turn are identical and equal to 10 m&OHgr;, the structure shown diagrammatically by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is obtained, on the basis of which the configurations illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> are produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> By assuming that the desired transformer possesses three windings P, S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having respectively six, three and two turns with the phases corresponding to the electrical diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> represent two exemplary configurations meeting the requirement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> With the first configuration (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), we obtain: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> R<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>&equals;(2*70)/3 m&OHgr; i.e. around 46.7 m&OHgr;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Rs<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;3*10&equals;30 m&OHgr;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Rs<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;10&plus;10/2&equals;15 m&OHgr;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Whereas with the second configuration (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), we obtain: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> R<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>&equals;2*70&equals;140 m&OHgr;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Rs<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;70/4&equals;17.5 m&OHgr;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Rs<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;20/6 m&OHgr; i.e. around 1.67 m&OHgr;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> This example demonstrates the possibility of configuring the number of windings, the number of turns and the resistance of each winding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the configurable transformer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> physically comprises a considerable number of windings since it conditions the number of combinations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The technology of the coil can be any of the known coiling technologies such as, for example: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> the linear or toric wire technology </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> the rigid or flexible printed circuit multilayer technology </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> the multilayer ceramic technology </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, for a plug-in or SMC version, the coil is constituted by a multilayer printed circuit block. Said groups of elementary windings are constituted by superposing a plurality of copper layers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> arranged between two semi-ferrites <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> forming the magnetic circuit of the transformer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, said copper layers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being separated by insulating layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the electrical connections between the groups of elementary windings are preferably etched on the printed circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> intended to receive the transformer as may be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Thus, the user of the transformer can himself configure it by planning the connection tracks during the CAD phase of the printed circuit of the electrical supply. The cost and the volume of connections of this type are virtually zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> This technology allows very good coupling between elementary windings even if their respective number of turns is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> According to other embodiments which are not represented, the connections may be for example wire connections (conducting wires electrically linking the various input/output pins of the elementary windings). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Assuming that the desired electrical configuration is that represented by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the physical layout of the transformer is illustrated by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> As is illustrated by this <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the connections between elementary windings are effected through copper tracks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> etched on the printed circuit <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the electrical supply. </paragraph>
