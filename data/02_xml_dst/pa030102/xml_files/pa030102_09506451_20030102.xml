<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As shown therein, a rectangular groove <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is formed at a rear intermediate portion of a rear cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of a LCD monitor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a VESA cover <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is engaged into the rectangular groove <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A stand <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is hinged to the VESA cover <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, so that the LCD monitor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fixed at a certain angle by properly widening the stand <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The VESA cover <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is formed in a rectangular plate shape and has a circular groove <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> formed at a certain side. In addition, a rotation plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is rotatably installed at a bottom <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the circular groove <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. A bent portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed at both ends of the rotation plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in a vertical direction. A through hole <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed at the bent portion <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. A hinge shaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is hingedly engaged in the through hole <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In addition, both ends <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the hinge shaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> pass through a hinge hole(not shown) formed at both ends of the stand <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and are fixed by a pair of nuts <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Therefore, the stand <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is integrally connected with the hinge shaft <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and is rotatable in a clockwise direction or counterclockwise direction by the rotation plate <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a view illustrating a construction that a stand is engaged at a back surface of a LCD monitor according to the present invention. As shown therein, a rectangular groove <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is formed at a back surface intermediate portion of a rear cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of a LCD monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a VESA cover <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is engaged in the rectangular groove <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is hinged at the VESA cover <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is shaped in a U-shape and is formed of a certain elastic material such as a stainless steel. A circular pad <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>formed of a rubber material is engaged at a bottom side. Therefore, the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> does not slide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In addition, a pair of opposite hooks <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are protruded at both upper comer portions of a back surface of the VESA cover <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Therefore, since the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is fixed in the interior of the hooks <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> when the LCD monitor is hanged on a wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the LCD monitor is prevented from being inclined at a certain angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the construction that the stand is fixed at the VESA cover will be explained in detail. The VESA cover <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed of a rectangular plate. A circular groove <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> having a certain diameter is formed at one side of the same. A rotation plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is rotatably engaged at a bottom <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the circular groove <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by a screw <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Therefore, the rotation plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is rotatable in a clockwise direction or a counterclockwise direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In addition, both ends of the rotation plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are bent in a vertical direction for thereby forming a bent portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A hinge hole <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is formed at a certain portion of the bent portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Both ends of the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> pass through the hinge hole <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. In addition, a fixing nut <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is engaged at both ends <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, respectively, and contacts with an inner side of the bent portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Therefore, both ends <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are elastically movable in a center direction of the rotation plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and the movement of the same is restricted in the opposite direction by the fixing nut <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> When the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is fixed by the rotation plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a semicircular cap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) seals the circular groove <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the VESA cover <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is exposed to the outside through a hole <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> a formed at both sides of the cap <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the hooks <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> protruded at both upper comer portions of the VESA cover <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> each are shaped in an inverted L shape and are opposite to each other. Namely, a pair of the hooks <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are formed of a vertical portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>protruded in a vertical direction with respect to an upper surface of the VESA cover <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a horizontal portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>protruded in a horizontal direction from an upper surface of the vertical portion. In addition, a pair of the hooks <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> each include a certain space <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> therein. The spaces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are opposite to each other. Therefore, the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is fixedly inserted into the spaces <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. When the LCD monitor is hanged on a wall, it is possible to prevent a lower portion of the LCD monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from being inclined with respect to the wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The operation of the stand of the LCD monitor according to the present invention will be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 7</cross-reference>, in the case that the LCD monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed on a desk, the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is pulled back from the back surface of the LCD monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. At this time, since both ends <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are hingedly engaged to the hinge hole <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the rotation plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is widened at a certain angle. Therefore, the LCD monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> maintains a certain balance and is installed at a certain angle. At this time, since the circular pad <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>friction-contacts on the upper surface of the desk, LCD monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will not slide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the case that the LCD monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed upright, the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is rotated in a counterclockwise direction in a direction of a first arrow direction <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> by an external force. This external force is applied to the bent portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the bent portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the hinge plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through both ends <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for thereby rotating the rotation plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a counterclockwise direction. Therefore, since the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is rotated in a counterclockwise direction at an angle of 90&deg;, it is possible to install the LCD monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> uprightly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the case that the LCD monitor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is hanged on a wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is rotated in a counterclockwise direction or clockwise direction in accordance with the first arrow direction <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and then is positioned at an upper portion of the hook <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In addition, an external force is applied to the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and both ends <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are moved in a center direction through the hinge hole <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the rotation plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> When the distance of the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is smaller than the distance between the hooks <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is positioned between the hooks <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and an external force applied to the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is released. Therefore, the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> elastically moves in an opposite direction of the center through the hinge hole <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, so that the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is inserted into the space <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> formed in the hooks <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In addition, the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is prevented from being moved by the fixing nut <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> After the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is fixed at the hooks <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, when it is hanged at a support member <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> such as a nail of the wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, since the stand <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> contacts with an inner surface of the horizontal portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the hook <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, it is possible to prevent the LCD monitor from being inclined in the direction of the wall along a second arrow direction <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As described above, in the stand fixing structure of the LCD monitor according to the present invention, it is possible to implement a simple assembling process using the stand as a hinge shaft, and the fabrication cost is decreased. In addition, since the hooks are used, when the LCD monitor is hanged on a wall, it is possible to prevent the LCD monitor from being inclined with respect to the wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to the embodiment shown in the drawings, and it is apparent that various changes and other equivalent embodiments may be effected by those skilled in the technical art related to the present invention. Thus, the proper scope of technical protection of the present invention should be set up within the technical spirit of the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
