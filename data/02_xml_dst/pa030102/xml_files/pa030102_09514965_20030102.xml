<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to semiconductor device fabrication and, more particularly, to a method and apparatus for incorporating low dielectric constant materials within a multilevel metallization and interconnect structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The integrated circuit industry is moving towards denser device integration and faster switching speeds for devices within the integrated circuits. Until recently, the integrated circuit R-C delay that limits the device switching speeds was dominated by the front-end-of-line (FEOL) CMOS transistor driver capacitance and load resistance. For 0.25 um technology and beyond, the increase in signal delay due to the capacitance of device interconnections is becoming a limitation to improving device performance. To meet circuit speed requirements and to decrease crosstalk between adjacent metal interconnection lines, devices must be fabricated using materials having low dielectric constants (e.g., less than 3.8). In present integrated circuit manufacturing, silicon-dioxide (SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), having a dielectric constant of approximately 4.0, is generally used as an insulative material. However, a material with such a relatively high dielectric constant does not meet the speed requirements of today&apos;s devices and such materials promote excessive signal crosstalk between adjacent interconnection lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Alternative materials having lower dielectric constants than SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>include fluorinated silicate glass (FSG), having a dielectric constant between 3.5 and 3.8, as well as amorphous-fluorinated carbon (a-C:F), having a dielectric constant of less than 3.0. Additionally, various fluorinated organic or inorganic, spin-on or vapor deposited dielectric materials, such as fluorinated polyimide, fluorinated poly arylene ethers, parylene-F, and the like, have also been used within integrated circuits as relatively low dielectric constant materials. All of these materials are generally classified as &ldquo;low k materials&rdquo; when the dielectric constant (k) is less than 3.8 or &ldquo;ultra-low k materials&rdquo; when the dielectric constant (k) is less than 3.0. In this specification, these terms are used interchangeably and represent materials with a dielectric constant less than 4.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One process for producing a relatively low k material is by incorporating fluorine, with 2-3 atomic percent to as much as 40 percent, within a base material of silicon dioxide or amorphous carbon to form F&mdash;SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or a-C:F, respectively. However, a major problem with integrating these materials into a metallized structure, e.g., a BEOL structure, is that the fluorine corrodes metals such as titanium or aluminum-copper that are typically used for metallization of the integrated circuits. For example, titanium is an integral part of a BEOL metallization process and helps to decrease the interface resistance at the via bottom. However, when titanium is integrated into a fluorine-based oxide, numerous volcanoes are generated on the titanium surface. This volcano formation is due to corrosion of the titanium by the fluorine within the F&mdash;SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Such volcanoes cause a decrease in device reliability within the integrated circuit, as well as drastically reduce the lifetime of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Fluorinated oxide deposited using a high-density plasma, where the fluorine is more tightly bonded to the silicon oxide, also has similar problems during integration with metals. In such structures, the fluorine level in the bulk titanium is an order of magnitude higher than the background level in an undoped film. This indicates the fluorine penetrates into the titanium layer deposited on top of the dielectric. Such penetration can lead to an increase in the via/contact resistance, and device failures due to corrosion. Similar problems arise when using aluminum-copper (AlCu) alloys for metallization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1D</cross-reference> depict a conventional process for producing a BEOL metallization structure. Within the structure, the metals detrimentally contact the dielectric during dielectric deposition and also during metal deposition when performing the plug and/or the interconnect metallization. Specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> depicts a pair of metal lines <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that have been formed on a substrate <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> using either a PVD process to deposit a layer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of titanium or titanium nitride above and below an aluminum-copper conductive layer <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. These lines are generally formed by pattern etching a uniformly deposited stack of metal layers to form the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, a</cross-reference> low k dielectric material (low k material) is deposited as a layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> atop the lines. Note that in this conventional process the metal lines contact the dielectric material of layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C, a</cross-reference> second dielectric layer <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> (e.g., TEOS) is deposited over layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The second dielectric layer is planarized using, for example, a chemical-mechanical polishing process. The second dielectric layer is patterned using a mask and both dielectric layers are etched to form a via <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Generally, the etch process removes some of the metal material at the bottom of the via to ensure a sufficiently conductive contact will be made between the metal line and the via metallization, e.g., the etch is stopped upon contact with the aluminum-copper layer. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>D, titanium/titanium-nitride is deposited as a liner <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to contact the top surface of the metal lines <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The liner in the via is subsequently filled with aluminum-copper or tungsten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Within the foregoing conventional process, the metal contacts the low k dielectric when the first dielectric layer is deposited over the metal lines. When the first dielectric material is a fluorine-based, low k material, the metal reacts with the dielectric and detrimentally corrodes. The potential for such corrosion is apparent in the SIMS depth profile of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The SIMS depth profile shows that, when a low k dielectric layer (F&mdash;SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is contacted by a titanium layer within a Ti/HDP-FSG stack and annealed at 450&deg; C., as shown in the fluorine concentration curve <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the fluorine substantially penetrates into the titanium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a need exists in the art for a method and apparatus for fabricating multilevel metallization and interconnect structures that prevent metal corrosion when using low k dielectric materials as insulators. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The disadvantages associated with the prior art methods of fabricating multilevel metallization and interconnect structures using low k dielectric materials are overcome by the present invention. The present invention is a novel process that forms a structure for protecting a metallization layer from contact with the low k dielectric materials. Specifically, a barrier material is used, such as silicon nitride or a similar material, in the form of a sidewall spacer located between the metal lines and the low k dielectric material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> More specifically, metal lines are formed using a conventional method by depositing a uniform metal layer, patterning the layer and etching the layer to form metal lines atop a substrate. Generally, the metal lines contain a multiple layer structure having a layer of aluminum-copper (or aluminum) between layers of titanium nitride and the entire stack rests upon a layer of titanium. Alternatively, the metal line structure may be fabricated as a plurality of layers including a first layer of tantalum or tantalum-nitride, a layer of copper or copper alloy, and a second layer of tantalum or tantalum-nitride. Once the lines are formed, a layer of protective material such as silicon nitride is deposited over the metal lines. This protective layer ultimately forms the barrier between the metal lines and dielectric low k material. An anisotropic etch is used on the silicon nitride layer to open the silicon nitride atop the metal lines but leaving a silicon nitride coating on the sides of the metal lines. The low k dielectric is then deposited atop the metal lines and silicon nitride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment of the invention, the low k dielectric is then etched back below the top level of the metal lines. This etch back ensures that the low k dielectric will not form part of the &ldquo;via dielectric&rdquo;, i.e., the dielectric material between adjacent vias. A PTEOS layer (the via dielectric) is deposited atop the structure and planarized using, for example, chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP). A patterned photoresist is used as a via mask to etch the PTEOS layer to form vias within the PTEOS layer. These vias extend from the top surface of the PTEOS dielectric layer to the top surface of the metal lines. The via etch process also removes the titanium-nitride from the top of the metal line to expose the inner metal, e.g., the aluminum-copper. Finally, a metal layer(s) is deposited to line and fill the vias. Using this process, metal lines do not contact the low k film along the sides of the lines. As such, fluorine within the dielectric material does not penetrate the titanium and corrosion of the metal is eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In a second embodiment of the invention, an etchback process is not used to restrict the low k dielectric to a level below the top of the metal lines. As such, the low k material forms a portion of the via dielectric and additional steps must be performed to avoid metal line or via metal corrosion. To facilitate corrosion prevention, the second embodiment includes, in addition to the use of a sidewall barrier the following measures: modifying the metal line structure to contain layers of titanium/titanium-nitride, aluminum-copper, and titanium/titanium-nitride (i.e., the ARC layer is no longer titanium-nitride alone, but a titanium/titanium-nitride bi-layer); stop etching the via on the titanium/titanium-nitride layer of the metal line; and use only titanium-nitride for the via liner in lieu of a titanium/titanium-nitride liner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> More specifically, in the second embodiment the metal lines are formed upon a substrate as a stack containing a titanium/titanium-nitride layer, an aluminum-copper layer, and a titanium/titanium-nitride layer. As in the first embodiment, a barrier layer is formed and etched to protect the sidewalls of the metal lines. A layer of low k material is deposited over the lines. In this embodiment, the low k material is not etched back. Instead, a TEOS cap is deposited over the low k material layer and planarized using CMP. The TEOS cap is masked and vias etched through the TEOS cap and low k material layer. The etch is stopped upon the titanium/titanium-nitride layer of the metal line and does not penetrate the aluminum-copper within the line. Thereafter, a titanium-nitride liner is deposited upon the sidewalls and bottom of the via. The via is lastly filled with tungsten or aluminum-copper that does not contact the low k material. Consequently, the barrier layer separates the metal line from the low k material and the via contains no titanium.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The process of the present invention protects the metals within a multilevel metallization and interconnect structure by incorporating a barrier between the metal lines and a low dielectric constant material (low k material) used as an insulative layer with minimal effect on the overall dielectric constant of the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The first embodiment of the invention (FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>E) uses such a barrier layer as well as restricts the low k dielectric material to a level below the top of the metal lines. To accomplish the restriction, the low k material is &ldquo;etched back&rdquo; below the top level of the lines and, as such, the low k material does not form a portion of the via dielectric. If, however, the low k material cannot be restricted in this manner, a second embodiment of the invention enables the benefits of the first embodiment to be accomplished within a structure that has the low k dielectric as a part of the via dielectric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Specifically, FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>E depict the process steps for forming the BEOL structure in accordance with a first embodiment the present invention. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, metal lines <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> are conventionally formed upon a substrate <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> by physical vapor deposition (PVD) of a uniform metal layer, patterning the layer and then etching the layer into metal lines <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Generally, the metal lines are formed of a stack of metals containing, for example, a titanium layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>B, a titanium-nitride layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>D, an aluminum-copper (or aluminum) layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>A and second titanium-nitride layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>C, i.e., an aluminum or aluminum/copper interconnect. Alternatively, the metal lines may be formed of a plurality of layers including a first tantalum or tantalum-nitride layer, a copper or copper alloy layer, and a second tantalum or tantalum-nitride layer, i.e., a copper, copper alloy, or aluminum alloy interconnect line. As such, throughout this disclosure, the term metal line is intended to represent either copper, copper alloy, or aluminum interconnect lines as well as other metal line structures that would benefit from a sidewall barrier layer in the form of a sidewall spacer between the metal line and the insulator material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The present invention protects the sidewalls <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> of the metal lines using a sidewall barrier <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. The barrier material can be, for example, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, silicon dioxide, or any other material that would impede the corrosion of the metal line including CVD deposited titanium-nitride. Preferably, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the barrier is deposited over the metallized lines as a layer <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process or physical vapor deposition (PVD), depending upon the barrier material being deposited. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, the barrier layer <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is then etched back such that the barrier is removed from all areas, other than the sidewall <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> of the metal lines <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The barrier layer has a thickness that reduces fluorine corrosion of the metal line, but not so thick that the barrier layer significantly impacts crosstalk along the metal lines, e.g., the thickness is generally less than 500 &angst;. The etching step of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> is necessary to minimize the overall capacitance of the inter-line dielectric region (region <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>) and/or for preventing any shorts between adjacent metal lines, depending on the barrier used. For example, if an insulator with a relatively high dielectric constant (e.g., SiN having a k of approximately 7) is used as a barrier, a continuous SiN within region <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> can increase the capacitance of the structure, negating some of the advantages of using low k materials. However, if CVD TiN is used as a barrier, then a continuous TiN layer in the region <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> would provide a conductive path between adjacent metal lines and result in a short circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> During the barrier layer etch step, it is not necessary to remove all of the barrier material from the top surface of the metal lines <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, any unetched barrier material provides an additional measure of protection during low k material deposition. The excess barrier is then removed from the top surface of the lines during a subsequent via etch step (discussed below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>D, the low k dielectric material is deposited as a layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> atop the protected lines <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and then the layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> etched back to dashed line <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. The low k material is deposited using a conventional HDP-CVD process, PE-CVD process, vapor deposition, a spin-on process or any one of a number of other techniques that are available to deposit low k materials. The layer is etched back using a chemistry that is applicable to the low k material, e.g., if the low k material is a-C:F the etchant is an oxygen-based chemistry. To facilitate a uniform etch, a photoresist may be used to control the etch back process step. Such etch back control is especially necessary when the low k material is deposited using an HDP-CVD process. The etch back step ensures that the low k dielectric is restricted to a thickness that maintains the top of the low k dielectric layer below the top of the metal lines, i.e., the low k dielectric is a &ldquo;line dielectric&rdquo; that lies between adjacent metal lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</cross-reference> depicts the structure after a PTEOS layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> has been deposited and planarized, and the vias <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> have been patterned and etched into the PTEOS layer <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. The PTEOS layer forms a &ldquo;via dielectric&rdquo; that lies between adjacent vias. Note that in this embodiment of the invention the low k material is not part of the via dielectric. While etching the vias, any excess barrier material is removed from the top surface of the lines <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the metal line is generally etched to penetrate into the aluminum-copper layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>A, i.e., removing the titanium-nitride layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>C. Lastly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</cross-reference> depicts the process step where a &ldquo;liner&rdquo; <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> of, for example, titanium is deposited within the via <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Using the foregoing process, the barrier layer <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> ensures that the metal line <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> does not contact the low k material of the insulator layer <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. As such, fluorine penetration from the low k material into the metal line is eliminated. Since the barrier layer is relatively thin, it does not substantially affect the capacitance of the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>E depict the process steps of a second embodiment of the invention that facilitates metal line protection when the low k dielectric material can not be etched back below the level of the metal lines. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> depicts a metal line <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> comprising a metal stack of, for example, an aluminum-copper layer <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>A sandwiched between a pair of titanium/titanium-nitride layers <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>C. As with the previous embodiment, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B, a</cross-reference> barrier layer <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is deposited over the lines <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> to protect the sidewalls <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of the metal lines <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> the layer <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> is anisotropically etched to form the sidewall protection. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D, a</cross-reference> layer <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> of low k material is conventionally deposited either by HDP-CVD, PE-CVD, vapor, or spin-on deposition or using any one of a number of other techniques available for low k material deposition. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E, a</cross-reference> cap layer <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of TEOS material is deposited over the layer <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> of low k material. Note that in this embodiment, the low k layer is not etched back as in the previous embodiment. As such, the low k material forms part of the via dielectric, i.e., the dielectric material between adjacent vias. Since the low k material is part of the via dielectric certain steps are taken to protect the via liner and filler from corrosion. These steps are discussed below. </paragraph>
