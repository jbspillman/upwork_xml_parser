<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an ink jet recording apparatus comprising a recording head moving in a width direction of recording paper for jetting ink drops toward recording paper based on print data, thereby printing an image on the recording paper and a control technique of cleaning of the recording head for sucking ink from nozzle orifices of the recording head of the recording apparatus for recovering the print function of the recording head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An ink jet recording apparatus, which produces comparatively small noise at the printing time and moreover can form small dots at a high density, is much used for printing including color printing in these days. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Such an ink jet recording apparatus comprises an ink jet recording head for receiving supply of ink from an ink storage section of an ink cartridge mounted on a cartridge, a subtank, etc., and paper feeder for causing recording paper to make a relative move to the recording head. While moving the recording head on the carriage in a width direction of recording paper, the ink jet recording apparatus ejects ink drops to the recording paper for recording. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The recording head capable of jetting black ink and yellow, cyan, and magenta color inks is placed on the carriage and makes it possible to execute not only text printing in black ink, but also full color printing by changing the jet percentage of the inks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Since ink pressurized in a pressure generating chamber is jetted to recording paper as ink drops from a nozzle for printing, the recording head involves a problem of causing a print failure because of a rise in the ink viscosity and hardening of ink caused by vaporization of a solvent from nozzle orifices, for example, adhesion of dust, mixing of air bubbles, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus, if the nozzle orifice is clogged or the ink cartridge is replaced, the nozzle formation face of the recording head is sealed by capping unit and ink is sucked and discharged from the nozzle orifice by negative pressure from a suction pump, whereby clogging caused by ink hardening in the nozzle orifice, etc., and an ink jet failure caused by mixing air bubbles into an ink flow passage are dissolved. This function is called cleaning operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To execute the cleaning operation, it is effective to cause a flow as fast as possible to occur in ink in the ink flow passage from the ink storage section to the nozzle orifices of the recording head, for example, whereby the air bubbles existing in the flow passage as well as the ink having increased viscosity can be discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, to increase the flow velocity of ink at the cleaning operation time, the capability of the suction pump needs to be increased to provide large negative pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To do this, the pump must be upsized and a large-sized motor for driving the pump must also be used; it is inevitable to increase the costs and upsize the whole recording apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Then, a recording apparatus having the following configuration is proposed: A valve unit that can be opened and closed is placed in the ink flow passage between an ink storage section and a recording head and to perform cleaning operation, when sucking ink is started through capping unit, the valve unit is closed and when negative pressure in the capping unit rises, the valve unit is opened, whereby the flow velocity of ink in the recording head is increased instantaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The described configuration makes it possible to comparatively easily discharge ink hardened or having increased viscosity in the proximity of the nozzle of the recording head without providing a special suction pump for producing large negative pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Since the suction action from the nozzle is performed instantaneously, it is also made possible to produce the cleaning effect in a comparatively small discharge amount of ink as a result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> By the way, the ink cartridge of the ink storage section for supplying ink to the recording head generally has an outer case made of a material of polypropylene, etc., into which a porous substance is loaded for retaining ink. When the ink cartridge is shipped, it is deaerated, whereby the replacement load property (reliability of the operation of the recording apparatus when the ink cartridge is replaced and a new one is loaded) can be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> After the deaerated ink cartridge is loaded into the recording apparatus, the atmosphere gradually flows into the ink cartridge through an opening made in the top face of the ink cartridge as ink is consumed. Thus, the deaeration degree of ink in the ink cartridge lowers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> While a sufficient deaeration degree in the ink cartridge is provided, if ink is sucked by the capping unit, air bubbles smaller than the nozzle diameter occurring in the cap flow backward into the head flow passage by negative pressure of the ink cartridge, but disappear because the air bubbles are smaller than the critical radius. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> While a sufficient deaeration degree in the ink cartridge is provided, minute air bubbles in the ink flow passage also dissolve in ink; consequently, the probability that a print failure will be caused by dot dropouts caused by air bubbles is low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> However, if the deaeration degree of ink in the ink cartridge lowers, the capability of dissolving minute air bubbles also lowers, so that the effect of air bubbles is received and a problem of a print failure, etc., occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Then, when the cleaning operation of the recording head is performed, negative pressure is applied over a predetermined time, whereby the deaeration degree of ink in the recording head can be raised and the air bubbles produced by the deaeration action from ink grow with other air bubbles in one body, then the air bubbles are pushed out in a stroke by the ink flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In a recording apparatus as described above, generally ink cartridges containing black ink and color inks can be attached onto a carriage on which a recording head is placed detachably from above the carriage, and ink is supplied from each ink cartridge to the recording head via a hollow ink supply needle (also called hollow needle) placed upward on the carriage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the recording apparatus, the ink flow passage in the recording head is formed very delicately and therefore ink supplied from the ink cartridge to the recording head needs to be in a clean state with no foreign substances of dust, etc., mixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> That is, if a foreign substance of dust, etc., is mixed, a particularly narrow ink supply port in the ink flow passage of the recording head or a nozzle orifice portion is clogged with the foreign substance, so that the normal ink jetting action cannot be executed and it is made impossible to recover the recording head function in many cases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Then, generally a filter member for removing foreign substances is placed in the ink flow passage upstream from the recording head, for example, between the hollow needle and a head case supporting the hollow needle, thereby preventing foreign substances from entering the recording head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference> shows the situation in a cross-sectional state. In the figure, numeral <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> denotes a hollow needle on which an ink cartridge <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is placed for deriving ink stored in the ink cartridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The upper end part of the hollow needle <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> is sharpened and an ink derivation hole <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is made in a part of the upper end part. The hollow needle <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> closely joined to a rubber sealing member <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>attached to the ink cartridge <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> allows ink to derive from the ink cartridge <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> through the ink derivation hole <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The base end part of the hollow needle <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> is widened to the bottom end and a tapered space <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is formed in the part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a space <highlight><bold>471</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is also formed on the side of a head case <highlight><bold>471</bold></highlight> of the recording head to which the base end part of the hollow needle <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> is attached, and a filter member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is placed between the base end part of the hollow needle <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> sandwiching the spaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The spaces are thus provided above and below the filter member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>with the filter member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>between, whereby the area of the filter member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is made effectively wide for suppressing dynamic pressure (pressure loss) of the filter member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As understood from the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</cross-reference>, in a state in which the ink flow passage formed in the hollow needle <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> and the filter member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>are placed in a gravity direction, a phenomenon in which an air bubble A remains particularly in the tapered space <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>formed in the hollow needle <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> on the top of the filter member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>occurs, for example, at the initial loading time of first loading ink into the flow passage of the recording head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> When the ink cartridge is replaced, a phenomenon in which air bubble A enters the space <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>on the top of the filter member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and remains in a stuck state in the space <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>also occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, if printing is executed with the air bubble A remaining as described above and the printing state is full duty (state in which ink is jetted at the highest frequency at the same time from all nozzle orifices), the air bubble A remaining upstream from the filter member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>moves slowly to the proximity of the filter member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>together with the ink flow and remains like flat on the top of the filter member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, resulting in a state in balance with the flow velocity of ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> If the full-duty printing is further continued, a part of the air bubble A passes through the filter member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, reaches the ink flow passage in the recording head, and remains therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> If such a state is entered, the air bubble in the recording head produces so called cushion action of absorbing pressure change occurring in a pressure chamber based on print data, causing a problem in which it becomes impossible to jet ink from the recording head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Then, the cleansing operation is executed to exclude the air bubble, as described above. If the valve unit is opened when the negative pressure in the capping unit rises as described above, the flow velocity of ink in the recording head is increased instantaneously, so that the air bubble A is released from the stuck state in the hollow needle <highlight><bold>431</bold></highlight> and is brought close to the filter member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>or brought into intimate contact with the filter member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, but is not excluded since the negative pressure accumulated in the capping unit also lowers at once; this is a problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In this case, a part of the air bubble passes through the filter member <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and can stay in the ink flow passage in the recording head, also causing a problem in which it becomes impossible to jet ink from the recording head, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It is therefore the first object of the invention to provide an ink jet recording apparatus and a recording head cleaning control method in the ink jet recording apparatus wherein at the cleaning operation time, a valve unit placed in an ink flow passage between an ink cartridge and nozzle orifices of a recording head is opened for instantaneously increasing the flow velocity of ink and the wait time for promoting the deaeration action is preset, whereby ink having increased viscosity can be discharged and removed and the air bubbles in the ink flow passage can be discharged easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> It is therefore the second object of the invention to provide an ink jet recording apparatus provided with a cleaning sequence capable of discharging and removing ink having increased viscosity and effectively discharging air bubbles remaining in upper and lower spaces with a filer member between in an ink flow passage and a recording head cleaning control method in the ink jet recording apparatus. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A cleaning control method for the above ink jet recording apparatus comprises the steps of: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> opening the ink flow passage by the valve unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Here, the sealing step and the closing step may be executed synchronously or exchangeably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the predetermined time period is defined as either a time period required for obtaining a satisfactory deaeration degree of ink between the valve unit and the nozzle orifices, or a time period required for accumulating air bubbles therein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The valve unit is opened with the negative pressure accumulated, whereby it is made possible to efficiently discharge the air bubbles entering the recording head, for example, when the ink cartridge is replaced, together with a fast ink flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the valve unit drive controller holds the state in which the negative pressure is accumulated for the predetermined time and opens the valve unit after the expiration of the predetermined time, so that the air bubbles produced by the deaeration action from ink as the negative pressure is applied for the predetermined time grow with other air bubbles in one body and are pushed out in a stroke because of the ink flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In this case, sufficient negative pressure is applied to the inside of the capping unit, whereby the air bubbles can be moved quickly and be discharged from the nozzle orifices; consequently, the ink discharge amount can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Next, according to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided an ink jet recording apparatus comprising: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> e) the suction pump continues decompressing the internal space of the capping unit for a third predetermined time period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Preferably, according to the second or third aspect of the invention, the ink jet recording apparatus further comprises a filter member disposed in the ink flow passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> A cleaning control method for the ink jet recording apparatus according to the second aspect of the invention comprises the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> sealing the nozzle orifices by the capping unit; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> closing the ink flow passage by the valve unit; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> driving the suction pump to decompress the internal space of the capping unit; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> holding the decompressed state for a first predetermined time period; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> opening the ink flow passage by the valve unit while driving the suction pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Here, the sealing step and the closing step may be executed synchronously or exchangeably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> A cleaning control method for the ink jet recording apparatus according to the third aspect of the invention comprises the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> sealing the nozzle orifices by the capping unit; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> driving the suction pump to decompress the internal space of the capping unit; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> closing the ink flow passage by the valve unit; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> holding the decompressed state for a first predetermined time period; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> opening the ink flow passage by the valve unit while driving the suction pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> To adopt the cleaning control method in the ink jet recording apparatus according to the second or third aspect of the invention, preferably the method further comprises the step of stopping to drive the suction pump after a second predetermined time period has elapsed since the ink flow passage was opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the method further comprises the step of driving the suction pump between the sealing step and the closing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the method further comprises the step of driving the suction pump again after the stopping step has executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the method further comprises the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> releasing the capping unit from the nozzle orifices after the suction pump has driven again; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> driving the suction pump again to discharge ink from the nozzle orifices in a capping released state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> According to the ink jet recording apparatus adopting the control method, the valve unit placed in the ink flow passage between the ink cartridge and the nozzle orifices, for example, as ink storage means is closed in association with the cleaning operation of sucking ink drops from the nozzle orifices by the capping unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Then, the valve unit is opened in the state in which negative pressure is accumulated by driving the suction pump, whereby a fast ink flow can be generated instantaneously in the ink flow passage, whereby the air bubbles remaining in a stuck state in the ink flow passage can be peeled from the ink flow passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> At this time, the control sequence of continuing the drive state of the suction pump over the predetermined time is executed after the opening operation of the valve unit, whereby the air bubbles peeled from the ink flow passage based on the instantaneous fast ink flow can be discharged together with a continuous ink flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The other features preferably applied to the ink jet recording apparatus according the first to third aspects of the invention will be discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the ink storage unit is an ink cartridge mounted on a carriage for moving the recording head. The valve unit includes a valve body made of an elastic material through which the ink flow passage. The ink flow passage is closed by deforming the valve body with an external force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the ink flow passage can be easily opened and closed by the valve body; for example, the valve body is opened in a state in which the valve body is closed and negative pressure is supplied by the capping unit, whereby a strong ink flow can be generated in the ink flow passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the air bubbles remaining in the head filter upstream from each ink flow passage and the level difference part of the ink flow passage can be reliably discharged together with the ink flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a higher negative pressure state can be provided without using a high-capability suction pump, and a high-capability drive pump need not be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the ink jet recording apparatus can be manufactured at lower costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Further, according to the invention, there is provided an ink suction method in the described ink jet recording apparatus, comprising the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> closing the ink flow passage by the valve unit; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> sealing the nozzle orifices by the capping unit; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> driving the suction pump to decompress the internal space of the capping unit; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> opening the ink flow passage by the valve unit to discharge ink from the nozzle orifices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Since the valve opening step of opening the valve unit is executed after negative pressure is raised at the suction step, a strong ink flow can be generated in the ink flow passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the air bubbles remaining in the head filter upstream from each ink flow passage and the level difference part of the ink flow passage can be reliably discharged together with the ink flow, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the method further comprises the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> moving the carriage to the predetermined position to drive the valve unit such that the ink flow passage is closed to prevent the discharged ink and air bubbles from flowing back to the nozzle orifices; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> cleaning the nozzle orifices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Since the step of placing the valve unit in a closed valve state is executed before the step of cleaning the nozzle orifices of the recording head is executed, a backflow into which ink or an air bubble discharged to the nozzle orifices of the recording head is again pulled can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the ink flow passage in the valve body has a cross sectional shape which is asymmetric with respect to a first line extending perpendicular to a direction of which the external force is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Thus, the valve body is an elastic substance in which an ink flow passage is provided, and is closed as the elastic substance is deformed by external pressure, and in addition, if the external pressure is removed, the valve body is opened because of the restoration force of the elastic member, so that the valve body can be opened and closed in a comparatively simple structure. Since the ink supply passage in the valve body is shaped like the above-mentioned form, the valve body becomes easily by a small external force and the ink flow passage can be closed completely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the valve unit includes a flexible diaphragm which constitutes a part of a side wall of the ink flow passage, and an actuation body for deforming the diaphragm in a direction perpendicular to the ink flow passage for opening/closing the ink flow passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a convex is formed on one face of the diaphragm and the actuation body deforms the diaphragm such that the convex closes the ink flow passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the actuation body is a rod member to press a portion on the other face of the diaphragm where is opposed to the convex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> According to the configuration, the valve unit comprising the diaphragm closes the communicating hole forming the ink flow passage to the recording head at the center upon reception of press pressure of an actuator as the actuation body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Particularly, the annular convex formed at almost the center of the diaphragm closes the communicating hole to the recording head, so that the convex forms a flexible seal face and the reliable valve opening and closing operation can be executed in accordance with the linear move operation of the actuation body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> According to the configuration, if negative pressure is applied with the recording head capped, the diaphragm receives the negative pressure, the sealability in the closed valve state is furthermore enhanced, and the reliable valve closing function is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The diaphragm can extremely lessen volume change of the recording head involved in the operation of opening and closing the valve and a problem of destroying a meniscus of ink formed in the nozzle orifices of the recording head can be circumvented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the valve unit includes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> a flexible diaphragm having a through hole which constitutes a part of the ink flow passage; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> an actuation body for deforming the diaphragm in a direction of which the through hole extends while closing one opening of the through hole; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> a wall member for closing the other opening of the through hole when the diaphragm is deformed by the actuation body to close the ink flow passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the through hole is formed on a substantial center portion of the diaphragm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the wall member is arranged an upstream side of the ink flow passage with respect to the diaphragm to constitute a check valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the actuation body includes a spring member for normally urging the diaphragm toward the wall member. A predetermined or more pressure difference between an upstream side and a downstream side of the ink flow passage with respect to the diaphragm moves the actuation body to open the ink flow passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The through hole is abutted against the wall part by press pressure of an actuator as the actuation body, whereby the valve unit is placed in a closed valve state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the reliable valve opening and closing operation can be executed in accordance with the linear move operation of the actuation body like the valve unit comprising the diaphragm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Particularly, the spring member for normally urging the diaphragm to the wall part side is placed, so that check valve is formed, and the function as a pressure regulating valve for placing the valve unit in an open valve state based on the pressure difference between the upstream and downstream sides of the diaphragm can also be provided. The flow passage can be opened in response to slight ink consumption during the print operation for supplying ink to the recording head without imposing excessive load on the recording head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the valve unit includes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> a valve control chamber which constitutes a part of the ink flow passage; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> a flexible diaphragm which constitute a bottom wall of the valve control chamber; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> an actuation body for deforming a center portion of the diaphragm in a direction perpendicular thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the valve control chamber has an entrance port formed on a top wall thereof at a portion where is away from the center portion of the diaphragm, and an exit port formed on the top wall at right above the center portion of the diaphragm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the entrance port is arranged below the exit port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the circumferential portion of the exit port is tapered such that a diameter of the port is reduced toward the above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the diaphragm includes an annular convex on the center portion thereof for sealing the exit port when the diaphragm is deformed by the actuation body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Preferably, an annular groove is formed so as to surround the exit port, against which the annular convex is to be abutted. An outer peripheral wall of the groove is tapered such that a diameter of thereof is reduced toward the above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a distance between the annular convex and the annular groove is 1.0-1.3 mm when the ink flow passage is opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a cross sectional area of the ink flow passage between the exit port and the recording head becomes larger as further from the exit port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the actuation body is a rod member arranged below the diaphragm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> According to the configuration, the diaphragm valve is opened in the state in which negative pressure is given to the nozzle formation face of the recording head by the capping unit, whereby a fast ink flow can be generated instantaneously in the ink flow passage from the ink storage section to the nozzle orifices of the recording head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Since the valving control chamber of the ink flow passage from the ink storage section to the recording head is formed on the top side of the diaphragm in the gravity direction, the air bubbles remaining in the valving control chamber can be effectively discharged together with the fast ink flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In addition, the exit port from the valving control chamber to the recording head is formed just above almost the center of the diaphragm valve and the slope whose diameter lessens toward the anti-gravity direction is furthermore formed in the surrounding of the exit port, whereby the air bubbles remaining in the valving control chamber can be guided into the vicinity of the exit port by the float action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the configuration, the air bubbles in the valving control chamber can also be effectively discharged in the normal ink flow and the most of the feature that the air bubbles are hard to remain can be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Further, since the ink flow velocity can be increased instantaneously as described above, it is made possible to enhance the discharge effect of the remaining air bubbles still more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Since the annular convex formed almost at the center of the diaphragm valve facing the side of the valving control chamber closes the exit port from the valving control chamber to the recording head, the annular convex forms a flexible seal face and the reliable valve opening/closing operation can be provided following the linear move operation of the actuation body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> According to the configuration, if negative pressure is applied with the recording head capped, the diaphragm valve receives the negative pressure, the sealability in the closed valve state is furthermore enhanced, and the reliable valve closing function is maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The diaphragm valve makes it possible to extremely lessen volume change of the recording head involved in the operation of opening and closing the valve and a problem of destroying a meniscus of ink formed in the nozzle orifices of the recording head can be circumvented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the ink storage unit includes an air hole communicating with atmosphere, and an air valve for opening/closing the air hole. When pressure in the ink storage unit reaches for a predetermined value under a condition that both of the air hole and the ink flow passage is closed, the air hole is opened prior to the ink flow passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Since the air introduction port is closed by the air introduction valve and the ink flow passage is closed by the valve unit, the ink storage section can be hermetically sealed, evaporation of a solvent of ink can be prevented, and an increase in viscosity of ink can be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Moreover, if the pressure in the ink storage section becomes the predetermined pressure or more or the predetermined pressure or less, the air introduction valve is opened preceding the valve unit. Thus, if the outside temperature rises and the pressure in the subtank becomes high because of expansion of ink or air or if the outside temperature lowers and the pressure in the subtank becomes low, breakage of the ink storage section can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Ink drips from the recording head or inflow of air from the recording head can also be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the ink flow passage is still closed even if the air hole is opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Since the valve unit is also maintained closed if the air introduction valve is opened preceding the valve unit, ink drips from the nozzle of the recording head, etc., can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a force for closing the air hole is weaker than a force for closing the ink flow passage to discharge internal air of the ink storage unit when pressure inside the ink storage unit is varied due to temperature rising. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> According to the configuration, the air introduction valve can be opened preceding the valve unit for lowering the raised pressure in the ink storage section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Preferably, external air is introduced from the air hole when pressure inside the ink storage unit is varied due to temperature dropping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> According to the configuration, the air introduction valve can be opened preceding the valve unit for raising the pressure in the ink storage section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the ink storage unit may be an ink cartridge or a subtank to which a main tank replenishes ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the air valve is a check valve. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> a decompressor pump for decompressing inside of the subtank to replenish ink from the main tank; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> a pump connection unit detachably provided with a suction passage connecting the subtank and the decompressor pump; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> a first valve provided between the pump connection unit and the subtank for opening/closing the suction passage; </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> If the pressure in the ink storage section becomes the predetermined pressure or more or the predetermined pressure or less, the valve provided on the subtank side of the pump connecting unit is opened preceding the valve unit. Thus, if the outside temperature rises and the pressure in the subtank becomes high because of expansion of ink or air or if the outside temperature lowers and the pressure in the subtank becomes low, breakage of the ink storage section can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Ink drips from the recording head or inflow of air from the recording head can also be prevented. </paragraph>

Therefore, the deaeration degree of ink existing in the ink flow passage <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> from the nozzle orifices to the valve unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> rises because of the negative pressure and minute bubbles generated accordingly are accumulated as air bubbles and grow with other air bubbles in one body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> Since the value unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is opened after the expiration of the predetermined time as described above, a fast ink flow occurs in the ink flow passage from the ink cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to the recording head <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and the air bubbles grown in the flow passage together with the ink having increased viscosity are discharged to the side of the capping unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> together with the ink. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> As is clear from the description made so far, according to the ink jet recording apparatus and the recording head cleaning control method in the recording apparatus according to the first embodiment of the invention, the valve unit for opening and closing the ink flow passage is placed between the ink cartridge and the recording head and opening and closing the valve unit are controlled in association with the recording head cleaning operation, whereby negative pressure is accumulated. Thus, the air bubbles entering the recording head, for example, when the ink cartridge is replaced can be efficiently discharged accompanying a fast ink flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the valve unit driver operates so as to retain the negative pressure accumulation state for the predetermined time and open the valve unit after the expiration of the predetermined time.

<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is made possible to provide a high-reliability ink jet recording apparatus capable of effectively suppressing occurrence of a print failure in a recording head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> Next, an ink jet recording apparatus and a recording head cleaning control method in the recording apparatus in a second embodiment of the invention will be discussed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> For example, if a cleaning command is received on utilities in the host computer, a control signal is sent from the host computer to the cleaning sequence controller <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> gas shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and the cleaning sequence controller <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> outputs various control signals, whereby the cleaning operation is started. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> First, the cleaning sequence controller <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> sends a control signal to the carriage driver <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, whereby the carriage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is driven along a guide shaft <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and is moved to the home position side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> Thus, at step S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the wiping member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> wipes the nozzle formation face of the recording head <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, at step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the carriage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> furthermore moves to the home position side and at step S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the capping unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> caps the nozzle formation face of the recording head <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> accordingly. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> To do this, the cleaning sequence controller <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> sends a control signal to the valve unit drive controller <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, at step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, driving the suction pump <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is started. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> To do this, the cleaning sequence controller <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> sends a control signal to the cleaning controller <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, which then sends a control signal to the pump driver <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> That is, when driving of the suction pump <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is started, the negative pressure in the internal space of the capping unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> rises following the track like a quadratic curve, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> Thus, the negative pressure rises abruptly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> However, since driving of the suction pump <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is continued, the negative pressure does not rise to the atmospheric pressure and remains in a predetermined negative pressure state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> When the second predetermined time has elapsed since opening of the valve unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, driving the suction pump is stopped and the negative pressure rises to the atmospheric pressure abruptly. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0365" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0365&rsqb;</number> The second substantial suction step (S<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) is thus executed, whereby the ink flow passage is made neat after the powerful cleaning operation with the valve unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> open while driving of the suction pump is continued. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0366" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0366&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, after the second substantial suction step (S<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) is executed, idle suction operation is further executed at step S<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> for discharging ink from the capping unit in a release state of sealing the recording head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0367" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0367&rsqb;</number> The idle suction operation is executed, whereby the ink sucked and discharged into the capping unit by performing the second substantial suction operation is fed into the waste ink tank <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> If the first substantial suction step (S<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>), the second substantial suction step (S<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>), and the idle suction step (S<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> are added, for example, to the control sequence in the third embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, similar effects can be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0369&rsqb;</number> In this case, preferably the first substantial suction step (S<highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>) is inserted following step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and is executed, and the second substantial suction step (S<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) and the idle suction step (S<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>) are inserted following steps S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> respectively and are executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0370&rsqb;</number> In the control sequences shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 10</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> whether or not ink has been sucked as many times as the predetermined number of times is determined at step S<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, but ink need not be sucked more than once if a sufficient cleaning result can be provided by executing one ink suction operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0371" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0371&rsqb;</number> According to the ink jet recording apparatus adopting the cleaning control method according to the second embodiment, the third embodiment of the invention, the valve unit for opening and closing the ink flow passage is placed between the ink storage section and the recording head, the suction pump is driven with the valve unit closed, and the valve unit is opened in a state in which negative pressure is accumulated in the internal space of the capping unit, so that a fast ink flow can be generated in the ink flow passage at the instant at which the valve unit is opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0372" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0372&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the suction pump drive state is continued over the predetermined time after the valve unit is opened, thus the air bubbles peeled from the ink flow passage can be effectively discharged following the ink flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0373" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0373&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is made possible to provide a high-reliability ink jet recording apparatus capable of suppressing occurrence of a print failure in a recording head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0374" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0374&rsqb;</number> Next, a fourth embodiment of the ink jet recording apparatus of the type shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> using each ink cartridge mounted on the carriage as the ink storage section and comprising a preferred valve unit will be discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0375" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0375&rsqb;</number> That is the valve unit in the embodiment dissolves the following problems of the valve unit in the related art. Since a shaft is inserted into an ink flow passage and is rotated, a gap occurs in any part other than the ink flow passage and desired negative pressure cannot be provided because of recent tendency to increase the number of nozzle orifices, the suction pump has an insufficient capability to provide desired negative pressure; and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0376" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0376&rsqb;</number> Since the valve unit in the related art comprises O-rings used to enable rotation of the shaft inserted so as to cross the ink flow passage and retain the hermetic state, when the shaft is rotated, a large torque is required and a high-capability drive motor is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0377" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0377&rsqb;</number> Consequently, the ink jet recording apparatus having the valve unit in the related art cannot sufficiently meet the demand of manufacturing at lower costs. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0430" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0430&rsqb;</number> Further, the ink flow passage <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> in the valve body <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> is formed like a so called pentagon having one side positioned in a parallel direction to the line perpendicular to the application direction of the external pressure P on the side wall surface side (outer side) and one apex positioned facing the one side on the center side (inner side). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0431" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0431&rsqb;</number> The apex positioned on the center side (inner side) is rounded and other apexes are shaped each like a square. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0432" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0432&rsqb;</number> Further, the ink flow passage <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> in the valve body <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> is formed like a so called pentagon having one apex positioned on the side wall surface side (outer side) and one side positioned in parallel with the line perpendicular to the application direction of the external pressure P on the center side (inner side), contrary to that in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0434" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0434&rsqb;</number> Particularly, for the ink flow passage shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the tip on the side (side wall surface side) to which the external pressure is applied asymmetrically with respect to the line perpendicular to the application direction of the external pressure P is rounded, the opposite side is shaped like a so called trapezoid, and the intersection point is shaped like a square. Thus, as compared with the valve bodies <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the crush amount until the ink flow passage is closed can be lessened and consequently the closing load can be decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0435" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0435&rsqb;</number> Next, a suction method of ink from the recording head in the described ink jet recording apparatus will be discussed with reference to a flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0436" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0436&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> shows an example of an ink suction method of powerful cleaning using the valve unit, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0437" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0437&rsqb;</number> At step S<highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, the carriage motor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is driven for moving the carriage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the non-print area and the recording head is capped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0438" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0438&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, at step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the carriage motor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is driven for moving the carriage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the non-print area until the pad <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the main body of the recording apparatus and the pin lever <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>of the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> interfere and the ink flow passage <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> formed in the valve body <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is closed, and the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0439" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0439&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, at step S<highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, the pump driver is operated for applying negative pressure to the nozzle orifices, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0440" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0440&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, at step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the carriage motor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is driven for moving the carriage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the print area until the pad <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the main body of the recording apparatus and the pin lever <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>of the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> do not interfere, and the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0441" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0441&rsqb;</number> As the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is opened, the negative pressure state is opened to the atmosphere instantaneously and the air bubbles in the upper part of the head filter or entering the recording head are discharged from the nozzle orifices together with discharging of ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0442" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0442&rsqb;</number> Thus, the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> according to the invention is closed at step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and negative pressure is applied at step S<highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, whereby it is made possible to generate negative pressure higher than negative pressure applied by normal pump between the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> and the suction pump <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a large negative pressure can be generated even by a low-capability pump, so that it is made possible to make low noise, miniaturize the recording apparatus, and manufacture it at low costs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0443" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0443&rsqb;</number> Sufficient negative pressure is applied between the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> and the suction pump <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at step S<highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and when the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is opened at step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, only the atmospheric open part of the ink cartridge is opened to the atmosphere, so that a quick ink flow occurs from the ink cartridge <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to the suction pump side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0444" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0444&rsqb;</number> Thus, the air bubbles moves in the head rapidly following the ink flow and are discharged speedily from the nozzle orifices together with ink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0445" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0445&rsqb;</number> If the negative pressure is set to &minus;0.3 kgf/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>with respect to the atmosphere in the closed value state, the bubbles in the upper part of the head filter are expanded and pass through the head filter before the valve unit is opened. After this, if the valve unit is closed, the expanded air bubbles are restored to the former state downstream from the head filter and are discharged to the outside along the ink flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0446" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0446&rsqb;</number> Steps S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are repeated more than once, whereby it is made possible to discharge air bubbles that cannot be discharged by executing the steps once. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0447" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0447&rsqb;</number> In this case, if the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is opened at step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> or applied negative pressure becomes atmospheric pressure at step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and then again the process is returned to step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is closed, applying the negative pressure can be continued until the negative pressure applied at step S<highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> becomes atmospheric pressure, and the dischargeability of air bubbles can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0448" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0448&rsqb;</number> Further, if before the applied negative pressure is restored to atmospheric pressure after the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is opened at step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, again the process is returned to step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is closed, a pulsation state can be entered as pressure. Also in this case, the dischargeability of air bubbles can be enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0449" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0449&rsqb;</number> Before the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is closed at step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the suction step is executed for sucking ink into the capping unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the suction pump <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, then the valve closing step (step S<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>), the suction step (step S<highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>), and the valve opening step (SI <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) are executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0450" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0450&rsqb;</number> The suction step is thus executed before the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is closed, whereby the capping unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the suction pump <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are filled with ink, so that negative pressure can be raised rapidly at the subsequent suction step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0451" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0451&rsqb;</number> Further, the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is opened at step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> while the suction step (step S<highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>) is being executed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0452" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0452&rsqb;</number> In this case, negative pressure is always applied to the nozzle orifices, so that air bubbles hard to discharge can also be discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0453" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0453&rsqb;</number> Further, any valve where ink suction is not required is closed, whereby unnecessary ink discharging can be decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0454" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0454&rsqb;</number> The ink discharge amount can also be decreased by closing the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> and sucking from the suction pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0455" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0455&rsqb;</number> Next, cleaning the ink jet recording head using the valve unit described above will be discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0456" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0456&rsqb;</number> First, after the negative pressure applied into the cap and the recording head <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is opened at step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the valve unit <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is again closed and remains closed until completion of the wiping operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0457" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0457&rsqb;</number> At this time, ink and air bubbles discharged at step S<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> remain in the capping unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and are deposited on a nozzle plate of the recording head <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0458" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0458&rsqb;</number> However, since the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is closed, the discharged ink and air bubbles can be prevented from flowing backward from the nozzle orifices and at the wiping time, the wiper can be prevented from pushing the air bubbles into the nozzle orifices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0459" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0459&rsqb;</number> Therefore, destruction of a meniscus formed in the nozzle orifices can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0460" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0460&rsqb;</number> It is effective to handle the valve unit also when the ink cartridge is replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0461" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0461&rsqb;</number> That is, the valve unit corresponding to the ink cartridge to be replaced is closed before the ink cartridge is replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0462" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0462&rsqb;</number> To replace the ink cartridge, it is feared that the meniscus of the nozzle orifices may be destroyed due to a shock when a new cartridge is mounted or volume change; the ink cartridge is replaced after the valve unit is closed, whereby the meniscus can be protected when the ink cartridge is replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0463" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0463&rsqb;</number> To replace the ink cartridge, it is made possible to skip the replacement cleaning operation after the ink cartridge is replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0464" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0464&rsqb;</number> In addition, the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight> is closed in the halt state of the ink jet recording apparatus, during transport thereof, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0465" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0465&rsqb;</number> At this time, the ink flow passage is closed upstream from the nozzle orifices in the valve unit <highlight><bold>523</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0466" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0466&rsqb;</number> Thus, drips of ink when the recording apparatus halts can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0467" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0467&rsqb;</number> The meniscus can also be protected against a shock during transport of the ink jet recording apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0468" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0468&rsqb;</number> In the description of the above embodiments of the invention, the recording apparatus comprising the ink cartridge mounted detachably on the carriage (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) has been covered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0469" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0469&rsqb;</number> However, the invention is applied to other recording apparatus than the described recording apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0470" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0470&rsqb;</number> For example, the invention can also be applied to a recording apparatus of a type wherein a separate main tank (ink cartridge) is placed in the main body of the recording apparatus and a subtank is mounted on a carriage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0471" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0471&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is a plan view to show a sixth embodiment of the ink jet recording apparatus of the type that can incorporate the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0472" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0472&rsqb;</number> In the figure, numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> denotes a carriage. The carriage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is driven via a timing belt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by a carriage motor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and can be reciprocated in the length direction of a paper feed member <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through a guide shaft <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0473" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0473&rsqb;</number> An ink jet recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is mounted on the side of the carriage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> facing recording paper <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0474" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0474&rsqb;</number> Subtanks <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> as ink storage sections for supplying ink to the recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are placed on the carriage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0475" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0475&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment, four subtanks <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are provided in a one-to-one correspondence with black, yellow, magenta, and cyan inks to temporarily store the inks in the subtanks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0476" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0476&rsqb;</number> Black, yellow, magenta, and cyan inks are supplied to the subtanks <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> from main tanks <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> as ink cartridges placed at the end of the recording apparatus via tubes <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0477" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0477&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, a capping unit <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> for sealing the nozzle formation face of the recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is placed in a non-print area (home position) on the move path of the recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0478" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0478&rsqb;</number> When the carriage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> moves to the home position, the capping unit <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> can move upward following the move of the carriage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for sealing the nozzle formation face of the recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0479" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0479&rsqb;</number> The capping unit <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> functions as a lid for sealing the nozzle formation face of the recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for preventing nozzle orifices from being dried during the halt period of the recording apparatus and functions as an ink receptacle during the flushing operation of idly jetting ink drops by applying a drive signal not involved in print to the recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and has a function of executing the cleaning operation of causing negative pressure produced by a suction pump (described later) to act on the recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for sucking and discharging ink from the recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0480" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0480&rsqb;</number> As described later, one end of a tube in the suction pump (tube pump) as a decompressor is connected to the internal space of the capping unit <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0481" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0481&rsqb;</number> A wiping member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> comprising an elastic plate of rubber, etc., is placed in the proximity of the print area side in the capping unit <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> so that the wiping member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can move forward and backward with respect to the move track of the recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. When the carriage <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> moves to and from the side of the capping unit <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, the wiping member <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can wipe and clean the nozzle formation face of the recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0482" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0482&rsqb;</number> The ink jet recording apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> is a comparatively large-scaled recording apparatus mainly provided for offices or business application. To handle a large amount of print, the ink jet recording apparatus needs to comprise large-capacity ink cartridges. Thus, main tanks as ink cartridges are loaded into a cartridge holder placed on the side of the main body of the recording apparatus, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0483" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0483&rsqb;</number> The subtanks are placed on the carriage on which the recording head is mounted, ink is supplied from the main tanks to the subtanks via ink supply tubes, and ink is supplied from the subtanks to the recording head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0484" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0484&rsqb;</number> That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, an ink cartridge <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is stored in a cartridge holder (not shown) placed in a part of the recording apparatus and ink is supplied from the ink cartridge <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> via a tube <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the subtank <highlight><bold>30107</bold></highlight> as the ink storage section placed on the carriage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0485" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0485&rsqb;</number> A valve unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for opening and closing the ink flow passage is placed between the subtank. <highlight><bold>30107</bold></highlight> and the recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0486" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0486&rsqb;</number> In this case, a filter member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is placed in the ink flow-passage from the valve unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to the recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and ink is supplied through the filter member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to the recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0487" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0487&rsqb;</number> The valve unit <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> adopts a diaphragm valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>as shown on an enlarged scale in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0488" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0488&rsqb;</number> The diaphragm valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is placed in a cup-like housing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>placed between an ink flow passage <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from the subtank <highlight><bold>30107</bold></highlight> and an ink flow passage <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from the diaphragm valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>to the recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0489" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0489&rsqb;</number> A valve shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>for supporting almost the center of the diaphragm valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is driven axially by an actuator (not shown), whereby the center of the diaphragm valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is moved up and down and the valve is opened and closed in the housing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0490" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0490&rsqb;</number> That is, the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> is an open valve state. When the valve shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g </italic></highlight>is driven upward in the figure, the center of the diaphragm valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>closes the ink flow passage <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to the recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, formed on the housing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and a closed valve state is entered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0491" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0491&rsqb;</number> The configuration is preferably adopted for a comparatively large-scaled recording apparatus for handling a large paper width and a comparatively small amount of ink is always stored in each subtank, whereby inertia resistance for the reciprocating carriage can be decreased. The advantages similar to those described above can also be provided by adopting the control sequence shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, 10</cross-reference>, or <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the described recording apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0492" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0492&rsqb;</number> Next, a seventh embodiment of ink jet recording apparatus of the invention will be discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0493" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0493&rsqb;</number> This preferred embodiment of ink jet recording apparatus of the invention, first an ink jet recording apparatus comprising a valve unit high in durability and capable of providing a reliable opening/closing action with a comparatively small actuating force will be discussed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0494" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0494&rsqb;</number> The embodiment discussed here can be applied to both a recording apparatus of a type wherein an ink cartridge placed on a carriage is used as an ink storage section (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and a recording apparatus of a type wherein a separate main tank is placed in the main body of the recording apparatus and a subtank is mounted on a carriage (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>); the latter type is taken as an example in the description to follow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0495" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0495&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> is a schematic drawing to show an ink supply passage from a subtank to a recording head of a recording apparatus incorporating the embodiment and a discharge passage from capping unit to a waste ink tank. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0538" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0538&rsqb;</number> Therefore, ink pressurized in the main tank <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is supplied to the subtank <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> mounted on a carriage via an ink replenishment valve <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and an ink replenishment tube <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0539" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0539&rsqb;</number> The configuration of the subtank <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> will be discussed in detail below. In the basic configuration of the subtank <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, a float member <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> is placed in the subtank <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and a permanent magnet is attached to a part of the float member <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0541" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0541&rsqb;</number> According to the configuration, a magnetic force line of the permanent magnet <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> acts on the magnetoelectric devices <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in accordance with the float position of the float member <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> responsive to the ink amount in the subtank <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0542" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0542&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the ink amount in the subtank <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> can be detected based on electric output of the magnetoelectric devices <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0543" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0543&rsqb;</number> According to the described configuration, for example, if the ink amount in the subtank <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> lessens, the position of the float member <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> housed in the subtank <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> moves in the gravity direction and the position of the permanent magnet <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> also moves in the gravity direction accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0544" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0544&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the ink replenishment valve <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is opened in response to electric output of the magnetoelectric devices <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as the permanent magnet <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> moves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0545" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0545&rsqb;</number> Thus, the ink pressurized in the main tank <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is sent to the subtank <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> in which the ink amount lowers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0546" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0546&rsqb;</number> If the ink amount in the subtank <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> reaches a sufficient amount, the valve <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is opened based on electric output of the magnetoelectric devices <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0547" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0547&rsqb;</number> Such a process is repeated, whereby ink is supplied from the main tank <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to the subtank <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> intermittently, so that an almost constant amount of ink is always stored in each subtank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0548" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0548&rsqb;</number> Since the ink pressurized by air pressure in the main tank <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is thus supplied to each subtank based on electric output based on the position of the float member placed in the subtank, ink replenishment response can be enhanced and the ink storage amount in the subtank can be managed appropriately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0549" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0549&rsqb;</number> From the subtank <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, ink is supplied to the recording head <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> via a valve unit <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> (described later) and a tube <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> connected thereto. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0617" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0617&rsqb;</number> Generally, top lid members of ink cartridges, subtanks, etc., are formed each with an air introduction port, thus an ink solvent is gradually evaporated through the air introduction port and the viscosity of the ink in the ink cartridge, the subtank, etc., is increased; this is a problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0618" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0618&rsqb;</number> As a solution to the problem, it is considered that a valve unit placed in the flow passage between the ink cartridge, the subtank, etc., and a recording head and a valve placed in the air introduction port are both closed when they are not used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0619" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0619&rsqb;</number> However, if the ink cartridge or the subtank is hermetically sealed, the ink cartridge or the subtank (ink storage section) is broken, ink drips occur from the recording head, or air flows in through a recording head nozzle because of internal pressure change of the ink storage section caused by temperature change, namely, new problems occur and need to be solved. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0683" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0683&rsqb;</number> Therefore, ink is supplied from the main tank <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> through the valve units <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> to the subtank <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0685" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0685&rsqb;</number> At this time, the sealing member <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is sucked by the decompressor pump <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> and is brought into intimate contact with the valve body <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, and reducing pressure in the subtank <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is stopped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0686" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0686&rsqb;</number> Therefore, ink supply from the main tank <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> to the subtank <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is also stopped. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0695" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0695&rsqb;</number> The air introduction valve controller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> receives a command and the air introduction valve <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is opened or closed under the control of the air introduction valve controller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. The decompressor pump controller <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight> receives a command and the decompressor pump <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> is driven or stopped under the control of the decompressor pump controller <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The ink flow passage connecting unit <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> is placed in a connection state to or a disconnection state from the subtank side under the control of the ink flow passage controller <highlight><bold>375</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0697" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0697&rsqb;</number> The valve unit <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is opened or closed under the control of the valve unit controller <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0698" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0698&rsqb;</number> First, when the subtank becomes an ink end condition and the subtank is filled with ink, the timing controller <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight> sends a valve closing command to the valve unit controller <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> and sends a drive command signal to the decompressor pump controller <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight> after the expiration of a predetermined time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0699" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0699&rsqb;</number> Thus, after the valve unit <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is closed, driving the decompressor pump <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> is started. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0700" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0700&rsqb;</number> Under such control, the valve unit <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is already closed before the inside of the subtank <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is placed in a reduced pressure state by driving the decompressor pump <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a problem of sucking air from the nozzle orifices of the recording head and destroying a meniscus formed in the nozzle orifices can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0701" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0701&rsqb;</number> Likewise, the inside of the subtank <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is also placed in a reduced pressure state by sending a connection command to the suction passage controller <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> after the expiration of a predetermined time. Also in this case, the valve unit <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is already closed and therefore the problem of sucking air from the nozzle orifices of the recording head can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0702" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0702&rsqb;</number> Further, upon completion of filling the subtank with ink, the timing controller <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight> sends a valve opening command to the air introduction valve controller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> and sends a valve opening command to the valve unit controller <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> after the expiration of a predetermined time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0703" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0703&rsqb;</number> Thus, the air introduction valve <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is first opened and the reduced pressure remaining in the subtank is canceled, resulting in the atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0704" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0704&rsqb;</number> Since the valve unit <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is opened, the problem of sucking air from the nozzle orifices of the recording head can also be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0705" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0705&rsqb;</number> A drive stop signal is first sent to the decompressor pump controller <highlight><bold>373</bold></highlight> without sending a valve opening command to the air introduction valve controller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>, whereby the decompressor pump <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> is also stopped and the reduced pressure remaining in the subtank through the decompressor pump <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> is canceled during the expiration of a predetermined time, resulting in the atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0706" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0706&rsqb;</number> Since the valve unit <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is then opened, the problem of sucking air from the nozzle orifices of the recording head can also be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0707" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0707&rsqb;</number> The open and closing states of the valve units <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and the air introduction valve <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> during printing are as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0708" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0708&rsqb;</number> The valve unit <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is maintained open to supply ink to the recording head <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>, the valve units <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> are closed, and the air introduction valve <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is maintained open to place the inside of the subtank <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> under the atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0709" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0709&rsqb;</number> If the printing terminates and a non-print state is entered (for example, power is turned off), the timing controller <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</cross-reference> sends a valve closing command to the valve unit controller <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight>, which then causes the valve body <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the valve unit <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> to move down, blocking the ink flow passage E for hermetically sealing ink in the recording head <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> and in the ink flow passage E on the recording head <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0710" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0710&rsqb;</number> Consequently, evaporation of a solvent from ink in the hermetically sealed subtank <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is prevented and an increase in viscosity of ink is suppressed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0712" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0712&rsqb;</number> Consequently, evaporation of a solvent from ink in the hermetically sealed subtank <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> is prevented and an increase in viscosity of ink is suppressed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0714" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0714&rsqb;</number> Then, if the power is turned on, as ink is supplied to the subtank, the timing controller <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight> sends a valve opening command to the air introduction valve controller <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> and sends a valve opening command to the valve unit controller <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> after the expiration of a predetermined time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0715" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0715&rsqb;</number> Thus, the air introduction valve <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is first opened and the reduced pressure remaining in the subtank is canceled, resulting in the atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0716" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0716&rsqb;</number> Since the valve unit <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is then opened, the problem of sucking air from the nozzle orifices of the recording head can also be prevented. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0718" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0718&rsqb;</number> If the air introduction valve <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is opened, preferably the valve unit <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is maintained closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0719" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0719&rsqb;</number> Since the air introduction port <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> is opened, if the outside temperature rises and the pressure in the subtank <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> becomes high because of expansion of ink or air or if the outside temperature lowers and the pressure in the subtank <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> becomes low, breakage of the subtank <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> can be prevented. </paragraph>
