<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an ink container usable with an ink jet recording apparatus or the like, a valve unit for an ink container, an ink jet head cartridge provided with the ink container and an ink jet recording apparatus, more particularly an ink container manufactured through a blow molding process, a valve unit for the ink container, an ink jet head cartridge having the ink container and an ink jet recording apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a field of a liquid supplying system for supplying the ink to the recording head for ejecting the ink for effecting recording, an ink container capable of providing a negative pressure has been opposed and can be integrated with the recording head (ink jet head cartridge), and this system has been put into practice. The types of the ink jet head cartridge are classified into a type wherein the recording head and the ink container (ink accommodating portion) are normally integral, and a type wherein the recording head and the ink accommodating portion are separation members, and each of them is removable from the recording device, although they are integral in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As an easiest method of providing the negative pressure in such a liquid supply system, is to utilize capillary force produced by porous material or fiber members. The ink container used in such a method, the structure includes a porous material or a fiber member such as in compressed sponge accommodated in the entirety of the inside of the ink container and an air vent capable of introducing air into the ink accommodating portion to make the ink supply smooth during recording operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, the system using the porous material or fiber member as an ink holding member, involves a problem that ink accommodation efficiency per unit volume is low. In order to provide a solution to the problem, EP0580433 which has been assigned to the assignee of the present application has proposed an ink container comprising a negative pressure producing member accommodating chamber in fluid communication with the ambience and an ink accommodating chamber which is substantially hermetically sealed, wherein said negative pressure producing member accommodating chamber and said ink accommodating chamber are made integral, and are in fluid communication with each other only through a communicating portion (dual-chamber type). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> With such a dual-chamber type ink container, the ink supply to the negative pressure producing member accommodating chamber from the ink accommodating chamber is effected with a gas-liquid exchanging operation in which the gas is introduced and accommodated in the ink accommodating chamber together with the ink supply from the ink accommodating chamber into negative pressure producing member accommodating chamber, so that ink can be supplied under a substantially constant negative pressure during the gas-liquid exchanging operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> EP0581531 proposes a structure in which a container constituting the ink accommodating chamber is detachably mountable relative to the container constituting the negative pressure producing member accommodating chamber. With this proposal, when the ink is used up, only the ink accommodating chamber is exchanged, and therefore, the amount of the waste can be reduced, which is advantageous in terms of environmental health. In the structure in which the ink accommodating chamber (container) is mounted to or demounted from the part to be supplied with the liquid, such as a negative pressure producing member accommodating chamber or a recording head, the care should be taken to effect sealing at the connection opening to prevent ink leakage until the firm connection is established with the ink receiving part. As for them sealing means for the connection opening, a film seal, for example, is known. When the ink accommodating container and the ink receiving part are connected, a member such as a joint pipe provided in the ink receiving part pieces the film, and the joint pipe enters the connection opening of the ink accommodating container to establish fluid communication between the ink accommodating container and the ink receiving part. However, when the ink accommodating container and the liquid receiving part are detachably mountable relative to each other, it is desirable that following conditions are simultaneously satisfied. First, when the liquid receiving portion and the ink accommodating container are connected with each other, or when they are separated from each other, the ink does not leak from the supply portion of the ink accommodating container irrespective of the position or orientation of the ink accommodating container. Second, when the connection is carried out therebetween, the ink supply path is assuredly opened, and after the connection is completed, the ink is stately supplied out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Third, some uses may connect and remove repeatedly the ink accommodating container, and therefore, the above-described conditions are satisfied each time the ink accommodating container is mounted and demounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the case of the sealing using the film seal, when the ink accommodating container is removed when the ink in the ink accommodating container is not completely consumed, the ink leaks out since the connection opening (supply port) of the ink accommodating container is unsealably kept open. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It has been proposed that valve structure is provided at the supply port portion of the ink accommodating container. However, in the case of the dual-chamber type ink container of the ink accommodating container exchangeable type, the valve structure is provided in the position where the gas-liquid exchange occurs, and therefore, the valve structure is required to have the reliable opening and closing mechanism which is peculiar to the function of the valve and in addition to have a productive of smooth movement of the gas without stagnation and/or accumulation of the gas in the communicating portion and corresponding smooth supply of the liquid (ink). Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. HEI 11-58772 discloses a structure relating to exchange of the ink accommodating chamber. In this proposal, there are provided a main container portion connected with a recording head and an exchangeable sub-container portion, and a valve mechanism is provided for each of the supply portion of the main container portion and the supply port of the sub-container portion. The valve mechanism is such that valve mechanisms for the supply portion and the supply port are pressed toward each other by the valve mechanisms, by which the valve mechanisms are opened to enable ink supply. Therefore, desirable opening operation cannot be accomplished without balance in the forces of the valve urging members constituting the valve mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> However, when the exchange of the sub-container portion is repeated, the valve urging member in the supply portion side is deteriorated with the result of imbalance in the forces provided by the valve urging members. For example, when the urging force of the valve urging member of the main container portion becomes small due to the repeated mounting and demounting, it becomes not possible to release the valve mechanism of the sub-container portion, and therefore, the opening and closing operation is not reliable. If the urging force of the valve urging member in the sub-container portion is made weak as a countermeasure against the above-described problem, the ink leakage may occur during transportation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The valve member in the sub-container portion comprises a flange portion sealing the opening of the supply port, a rod-like projection projected outwardly from the flange portion, wherein the rod-like projection is brought into compact with the valve of the main container portion so that valves are mutually pressed and opened. In this structure, the positions must be controlled such that valve mechanism in the main container portion and the rod-like projection are assuredly pressed against each other to assure a linear motion of the sub-container portion, since otherwise the valve is not opened in the desirable manner. In order to carried out a safe valve opening operation, it is required that sub-container portion is translated (parallel movement) in the mounting operation. Otherwise (for example, using a rotational motion for the purpose of saving space required for the mounting operation), when the abutment of the valves, for example, when the rod-like projection is abutted to a frame of the supply portion before it is abutted to the valve mechanism of the main container portion, with the result that before the intended connection is completed, the valve of the sub-container portion is opened, and therefore, the ink leaks. Then, the intended opening using the urging force is not properly effected, and the valve may clog so that fluid communication is not assured. In addition, a large area is required for the mounting of the sub-container portion. Furthermore, the gas-liquid exchanging operation might be not reliable. Therefore, the valve structure disclosed in Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. HEI 11-58772 involves a problem to be solved in order to effect the desirable opening and closing of the valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in an apparatus effecting full-color recording a plurality of ink accommodating containers are juxtaposed. In this case, a thin (or small with) ink container structure has been proposed in consideration of saving of the foot print of the ink container. In order to assure the proper ink supply from the thin ink accommodating container, the area of the opening for the supply is desirably large. Particularly, when the container is a thin dual-chamber type valve in which the ink accommodating container is exchangeable, the valve structure is very significant in order to assure the reliability of the gas-liquid exchange. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an example of the container is of a dual-chamber type which is provided with the negative pressure producing member accommodating container and the ink accommodating container, and in which the ink accommodating container is exchangeable, the ink accommodating container comprises a hollow rectangular parallelepiped casing and a deformable inner bladder for containing ink therein, in the casing. The inner bladder constitutes a deformable ink accommodating portion or chamber. The casing and the inner bladder are connected with each other around the openings thereof. Except the connecting portion minute retained casing and the inner bladder, namely, the wall portions of the casing and the inner bladder are separable. The feature of such an ink supplying system using the ink container of this type is that inner bladder which directly accommodates the ink deforms with the consumption of the ink therein so as to reduce the inside volume of inner bladder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> When the ink is consumed from the inner bladder, the inner bladder deforms, and at a certain stage, the maximum area surfaces of the inner bladder are contacted to each other. When the inner bladder deforms in this manner, the bottom surface of the inner bladder separates from the casing depending on the position of the supply port, and by the deformation of the portion of the inner bladder adjacent the supply port, the ink flow path in the inner bladder and the bubble path for permitting the bubble to rise during the gas-liquid exchanging operation relative to the outside of the inner bladder are narrowed. Accordingly, when the inner bladder deforms, the flowability of the ink in the inner bladder lowers, and therefore, the ink supply performance may be insufficient when the further high speed printing is desired. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">General Structure </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective view of the ink jet head cartridge in the first of the embodiments of the present invention, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a sectional view of the same ink jet head cartridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, each of the structural components of the ink jet head cartridge in accordance with the present invention, and the relationship among these components, will be described. Since the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment was structured so that a number of innovative technologies, which were developed during the making of the present invention, could be applied to the ink jet cartridge which was being invented, the innovative structures will also be described as the overall description of this ink jet head cartridge is given. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment comprises an ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, a holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, a negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, an ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and the like. The negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is fixed to the inward side of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Below the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the ink jet head is attached to the outward side of the bottom wall portion of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Using screws or interlocking structures, for ease of disassembly, to fix the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is desirable in terms of recycling, and also is effective for reducing the cost increase which is incurred by the structural modification or the like. Further, since the various components are different in the length of service life, the aforementioned ease of disassembly is also desirable because it makes it easier to replace only the components which need to be replaced. It is obvious, however, that they may be permanently connected to each other by welding, thermal crimping, or the like. The negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises: a negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which is open at the top; a negative pressure controlling chamber cover <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> which is attached to the top portion of the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to cover the opening of the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>; two pieces of absorbent material <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> which are placed in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to hold ink by impregnation. The absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are filled in vertical layers in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, with the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> being on top of the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, so that when the ink jet head cartridge is in use, the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> remain in contact with each other with no gap between them. The capillary force generated by the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which is at the bottom, is greater than the capillary force generated by the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> which is at the top, and therefore, the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> which is at the bottom is greater in ink retainment. To the ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, the ink within the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is supplied through an ink supply tube <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The opening <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the ink supply tube <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, on the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> side, is provided with a filter <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, which is in contact with the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, being under the pressure from the elastic member. The ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is structured so that it can be removably mounted in the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. A joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, which is a portion of the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and is located on the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> side, is connected to the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by being inserted thereinto. The negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are structured so that the ink within the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is supplied into the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> through the joint portion between the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Above the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> of the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, on the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> side, there is an ID member <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> for preventing the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from being incorrectly installed, which projects from the surface of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, on the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The negative pressure controlling chamber cover <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is provided with an air vent <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> through which the internal space of the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is connected to the outside; more precisely, the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> filled in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is exposed to the outside air. Within the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and adjacent to the air vent, there is a buffering space <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, which comprises an empty space formed by a plurality of ribs projecting inwardly from the inward surface of the negative pressure controlling chamber cover <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, on the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> side, and a portion of the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, in which no ink (liquid) is present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> On the inward side of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, a valve mechanism is provided, which comprises a first valve body (or frame) <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>valve plug (or member) <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, a valve cover (or cap) <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, and a resilient member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>. The valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is held within the second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, being allowed to slide within the second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and also being kept under the pressure generated toward the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by the resilient member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>. Thus, unless the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is inserted through the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the edge of the first valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, on the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>side, is kept pressed against the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by the pressure generated by the resilient member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>, and therefore, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> remains airtightly sealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is inserted into the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is moved by the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> in the direction to separate it from the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. As a result, the internal space of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is connected to the internal space of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through the opening provided in the side wall of the second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, breaking the airtightness of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> begins to be supplied into the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> through the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. In other words, as the valve on the inward side of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> opens, the internal space of the ink holding portion of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, which remained airtightly sealed, becomes connected to the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> only through the aforementioned opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> It should be noted here that fixing the ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> with the use of easily reversible means, such as screws, as is done in this embodiment, is desirable because the two units <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be easily replaced as their service lives end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> More specifically, in the case of the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment, the provision of an ID member on each ink container makes it rare that an ink container for containing one type of ink is connected to a negative pressure controlling chamber for an ink container for containing another type of ink. Further, should the ID member provided on the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> be damaged, or should a user deliberately connect an ink container to a wrong negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, all that is necessary is to replace only the negative pressure control chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as long as it is immediately after the incident. Further, if the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is damaged by falling or the like, it is possible to replace only the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> It is desirable that the points, at which the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, are interlocked to each other, are chosen to prevent ink from leaking from any of these units when they are disassembled from each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is held to the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by the ink container retaining portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it does not occur that only the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> becomes disengaged from the other units, inclusive of the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, interlocked among them. In other words, the above components are structured so that unless at least the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is removed from the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, it is difficult to remove the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. As described above, the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is structured so that it can be easily removed only after the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is removed from the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Therefore, there is no possibility that the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will inadvertently separate from the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and ink leak from the joint portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The end portion of the ink supply tube <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> of the ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is provided with the filter <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, and therefore, even after the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is removed, there is no possibility that the ink within the ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> will leak out. In addition, the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is provided with the buffering space <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> (inclusive of the portions of the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the portions of the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, in which no ink is present), and also, the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is designed so that when the attitude of the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is such an attitude that is assumed when the printer is being used, the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>between the two absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which are different in the amount of the capillary force, is positioned higher than the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> (preferably, the capillary force generated at the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and its adjacencies becomes greater than the capillary force in the other portions of the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>). Therefore, even if the structural conglomeration comprising the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, changes in attitude, there is very little possibility of ink leakage. Thus in this embodiment, the portion of the ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, by which the ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is attached to the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, is located on the bottom side, that is, the side where the electric terminals of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are located, so that the ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be easily removed even when the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is in the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Depending upon the shape of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> may be integral with, that is, inseparable from, the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. As for a method for integration, they may be integrally formed from the beginning of manufacture, or may be separately formed, and integrated thereafter by thermal crimping or the like so that they become inseparable. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The front side of the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, that is, the side which faces the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, is slanted backward from the point slightly above the supply outlet hole <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>, forming a slanted (or tapered) surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the bottom end, that is, the supply outlet hole <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight> side, of the slanted surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> is the front side, and the top end, that is, the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> side, of the slanted surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> is the rear side. The slanted surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of ID slots <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> (three in the case of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) for preventing the wrong installation of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Also in this embodiment, the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is positioned on the front surface (surface with the supply outlet), that is, the surface which faces the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is a hollow container in the form of an approximately polygonal prism, and is enabled to generate negative pressure. It comprises the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, or the outer layer, and the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, or the inner layer (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), which are separable from each other. The internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is flexible, and is capable of changing in shape as the ink held therein is drawn out. Also, the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is provided with a pinch-off portion (welding seam portion) <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, at which the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is attached to the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>; the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is supported by the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Adjacent to the pinch-off portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, the air vent <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is located, through which the outside air can be introduced into the space between the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is a laminar bladder, having three layers different in function: a liquid contact layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, or the layer which makes contact with the liquid; an elastic modulus controlling layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b; </italic></highlight>and a gas barrier layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>superior in blocking gas permeation. The elastic modulus of the elastic modulus controlling layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>remains virtually stable within the temperature range in which the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is used; in other words, the elastic modulus of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is kept virtually stable by the elastic modulus controlling layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>within the temperature range in which the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is used. The middle and outermost layers of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be switched in position; the elastic modulus controlling layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and gas barrier layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be the outermost layer and middle layer, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Structuring the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> as described above makes it possible for the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to synergistically display each of the individual functions of the ink-resistant layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>elastic modulus controlling layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and gas barrier layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, while using only a small number of layers. Thus, the temperature sensitive properties, for example, the elastic modulus, of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is less likely to be affected by the temperature change. In other words, the elastic modulus of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can be kept within the proper range for controlling the negative pressure in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, within the temperature range in which the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is used. Therefore, the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is enabled to function as the buffer for the ink within the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (details will be given later). Consequently, it becomes possible to reduce the size of the buffering chamber, that is, the portion of the internal space of the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which is not filled with ink absorbing material, inclusive of the portion of the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, in which ink is not present, and the portion of the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, in which ink is not present. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the size of the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which in turn makes it possible to realize an ink jet head cartridge <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which is superior in operational efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, polypropylene is used as the material for the liquid contact layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, or the innermost layer, of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and cyclic olefin copolymer is used as the material for the elastic modulus controlling layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, or the middle layer. As for the material for the gas barrier layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, or the outermost layer, EVOH (ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer: EVA resin) is used. It is desired that functional adhesive resin is mixed in the elastic modulus controlling layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, because such a mixture eliminates the need for an adhesive layer between the adjacent functional layers, reducing the thickness of the wall of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> As for the material for the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, polypropylene is used, as it is used for the material for the innermost layer of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of ID member slots <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, which are arranged at the left and right edges of the front surface, corresponding to the plurality of ID members <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> for the prevention of the incorrect installation of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The installation mistake preventing function is provided by the installation mistake prevention mechanism, which comprises the plurality of ID members <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> provided on the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> side, and the ID member slots <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> provided by the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> corresponding to the positions of the ID members <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a large number of ink container unit installation areas can be made identifiable by changing the shapes and positions of the ID members <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and ID member slots <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The ID member slots <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> of the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, and the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, are located in the front surface of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, that is, the front side in terms of the direction in which the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is installed or removed. They are parts of the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is formed by blow molding, and the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed by injection molding. Giving the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> a three piece structure makes it possible to precisely form the valve body and ID member slots <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> If the ID member slots <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> are directly formed as the portions of the wall of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> by blow molding, the shape of the internal space of the ink containing portion becomes complicated, affecting the separation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> wall, or the inner layer of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, which sometimes affects the negative pressure generated by the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Separately forming the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and ink container portion <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and then attaching the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to the ink containing portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, as the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is structured, eliminates the aforementioned effect, making it possible to generate and maintain stable negative pressure in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is attached to at least the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is attached by welding the exposed portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, that is, the ink outlet portion of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, to the surface of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> corresponding to the exposed portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Since both the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the innermost layer of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are formed of the same material, that is, polypropylene, the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can be welded to the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> also at the periphery of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The above described welding method increases accuracy in the positional relationship among the mutually welded components, while perfectly sealing the supply outlet portion of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and therefore, preventing ink leakage or the like which tends to occur at the seal portion between the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> when the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is installed, removed, or the like motion. When the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is attached to the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> by welding as in the case of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in this embodiment, it is desired for the sake of better sealing that the material for the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> layer, which provides the bonding surface, is the same as the material for the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> As for the attachment of the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, in order to firmly join them, the shell surface which faces the sealing surface <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which is bonded to the ink containing portion <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, is joined, by interlocking, to the click portions <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, which is located at the bottom portion of the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, and the engagement portion <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, which is located on the side walls of the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, are interlocked with the other click portions <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Regarding the word &ldquo;interlocking&rdquo;, the mutually interlockable portions of these components are structured in the form of a projection or an indentation which fit with each other in an easily disengageable manner. Interlocking the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> with the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> allows both components to move slightly against each other. Therefore, the force generated by the contact between the ID members <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and the ID member slots <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> during the installation or removal of these components can be absorbed to prevent the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from being damaged during the installation or removal of these components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Also, interlocking the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> with the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> using only a limited number of the portions of the possible contact area makes it easier to disassemble the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, which is beneficial in consideration of its recycling. Providing indentations as the engagement portions <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the side walls of the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> makes the structure of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> simpler to form by blow molding, and therefore, makes the mold pieces simpler. In addition, it makes it easier to control the film thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Also regarding the joining of the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is joined to the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> after the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is welded to the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Since the click portions <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are interlocked with the engagement portions <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, in the state in which the peripheral portion of the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is tightly surrounded at the periphery of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> by the inward surface of the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, the joint portion becomes stronger against the force which applies to the joint portion when the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is installed or removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The shape of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is such that the portion to be covered by the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is recessed, and the supply outlet portion protrudes. However, the protruding shape of the front side of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is hidden from view by the fixation of the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Further, the welding seam between the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and ink storing portion <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is covered by the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, being thereby protected. The relationship between the engagement portions <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the corresponding click portions <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, with regard to which side is projecting and which side is recessed, may be reversal to their relationship in this embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> As described before, it is assured by the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and valve mechanism that ink does not leak when the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is installed. In this embodiment, a rubber joint portion <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is fitted around the base portion of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> of the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to deal with unpredictable ink leakage. The rubber joint portion <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> seals between the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, improving the degree of airtightness between the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. When removing the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, this airtightness could function as resistance. However, in the case of this embodiment, the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are interlocked with the presence of a small amount of gap, allowing air to be introduced between the rubber joint portion <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> and ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, and therefore, although ink is prevented from leaking, the force necessary to be applied for removing the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is not as large as it otherwise would be, because of the provision of the rubber joint portion <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Further, the positions of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and IC member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> can be controlled in terms of both the lengthwise and widthwise directions. The method for joining the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> with the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> does not need to be limited to a method such as the one described above; different joining points and different joining means may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 22</cross-reference>, the bottom wall of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is slanted upward toward the rear, and is engaged with the ink containing unit engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, by the bottom rear portion, that is, the portion opposite to the ink outlet side. The holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are structured so that when removing the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the portion of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, which is in contact with the ink containing portion engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, can be moved upward. In other words, when the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is removed, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is rotated by a small angle. In this embodiment, the center of this rotation virtually coincides with the supply outlet opening (joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>). However, strictly speaking, the position of this rotational center shifts as will be described later. In the case of the above described structural arrangement, which requires the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to be rotationally moved to be disengaged from the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the greater the difference by which the distance (A) from the rotational center of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to the bottom rear corner of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> corresponding to the ink containing unit engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, is longer than the distance (B) from the same rotational center to the ink containing unit engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, the more frictionally do the bottom rear corner of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the image containing unit engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> rub against each other, requiring a substantially greater amount of force to install the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, which sometimes causes problems such as deformation of the contact areas on both the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> side and holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Slanting the bottom wall of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> so that the position of the ink containing portion engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> side of the bottom wall of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> becomes higher than that of the front end of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, as in this embodiment, prevents the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from heavily rubbing against the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> during its rotational motion. Therefore, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be smoothly installed or removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the ink jet head cartridge is located in the bottom portion of the sidewall of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, on the negative pressure controlling chamber unit side, and the bottom portion of another wall of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, that is, the wall opposite to the wall in which the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is located is engaged with the ink container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>; in other words, the bottom rear portion of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is engaged with the ink storing container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. Also, the ink storing container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> extends upward from the bottom wall of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, so that the position of the top portion of the ink storing container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> becomes approximately the same as the position <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> of the horizontal center line of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, in terms of the vertical direction. With this arrangement, it is assured that the horizontal movement of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is regulated by the ink storing container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> to keep the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> correctly connected with the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, in order to assure that the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is correctly connected with the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> during the installation of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the top end of the ink storing container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is positioned at approximately the same height as the upper portion of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is removably installed into the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> by rotating the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> about a portion of the front surface of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> on the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> side. During the removal of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the portion of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which remains in contact with the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> functions as the rotational center for the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. As is evident from the above description, making the bottom wall of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the ink jet head cartridge slanted upward toward its bottom rear portion as described above reduces the difference between the distance from the rotational center <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> to the top end of the ink storing container engagement portion, and the distance from the rotational center <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> to the bottom end of the ink storing container engagement portion. Therefore, the portions of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, which make contact with the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and the portions of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, which make contact with the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, are prevented from strongly rubbing against each other. Therefore, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be smoothly installed or removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> By shaping the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as described above, it is possible to keep relatively small the size of the portion of the bottom rear portion of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, which rubs against the ink storing container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> during the installation or removal of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and the size of the portion of the ink storing container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, which rubs against the bottom rear portion of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, even if the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is enlarged to deliver ink at a greater volumetric rate. Therefore, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is prevented from uselessly rubbing against the ink storing container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> during the installation of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> into the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and yet, it is assured that the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> remains firmly attached to the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>, the movement of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> during its installation or removal will be described in detail. When the distance from the rotational center <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, about which the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> rotates during its installation or removal, to the bottom end <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> of the ink container engagement portion, is greater than the distance from the same rotational center <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> to the top end <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> of the ink container engagement portion, by an excessive margin, the force necessary for the installation or removal of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is excessively large, and therefore, it sometimes occurs that the top end <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> of the ink container engagement portion is shaved, or the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> deforms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Thus, the difference between the distance from the rotational center <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, about which the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> rotates during its installation or removal, to the bottom end <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> of the ink container engagement portion, and the distance from the same rotational center <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> to the top end <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> of the ink container engagement portion, should be as small as possible within a range in which the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is retained in the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> with a proper degree of firmness while affording smooth installation or removal of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> If the position of the rotational center <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is made lower than the position of the center of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the distance from the rotational center <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, about which the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> rotates during its installation or removal, to the top end <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> of the ink container engagement portion, becomes longer than the distance from the same rotational center <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> to the bottom end <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> of the ink container engagement portion. Therefore, it becomes difficult to accurately hold the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> at a point which is at the same height as the center of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Thus, in order to accurately position the vertical center of the joint portion <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, it is desired that the position of the rotational center <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is higher than the position of the vertical center of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> If the structure of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is changed so that the position of the rotational center <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> of ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> becomes higher than the position <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> of the vertical center of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the portion of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, which corresponds to the ink container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, becomes thicker, requiring the height of the ink storing container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> to be increased. As a result, there will be an increased possibility that the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> will be damaged. Thus, it is desired, in view of the smoothness of the installation or removal of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, that the position of the rotational center <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is close to the vertical center of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The height of the ink container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> has to be properly determined based only on the ease of the installation or removal of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. However, if the height of the ink container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is increased so that the position of its top end becomes higher than that of the rotational center <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, the length by which the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> contacts the ink container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> becomes greater, which in turn increases the sizes of the portions on both sides, which rub against each other. Therefore, in consideration of the deterioration of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the height of the ink container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is such that the position of its top end is lower than that of the rotational center <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment, the elastic force for keeping the position of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> fixed in terms of the horizontal direction is a combination of the force generated by the resilient member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> for pressing the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, and the force generated by the resiliency of the rubber joint portion <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). However, the configuration for generating the above resiliency does not need to be limited to the one in this embodiment; the bottom rear end, or the engagement portion, of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the surface of the ink storing container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, on the ink storing container side, the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, or the like, may be provided with an elastic force generating means for keeping the position of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> fixed in terms of the horizontal direction. When the ink storing container is in connection with the negative pressure controlling chamber, the rubber joint portion <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> remains compressed between the walls of the negative pressure controlling chamber and ink storing container, assuring that the joint portion (peripheral portion of the joint pipe) is airtightly sealed (it is not necessary to maintain perfect airtightness as long as the size of the area exposed to the outside air can be minimized). Also, the rubber joint portion <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> plays an auxiliary role in coordination with a sealing projection, which will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Next, the internal structure of the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are disposed in layers as members for generating negative pressure, the former being on top of the latter. Thus, the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is exposed to the outside air through the air vent <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, whereas the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is airtightly in contact with the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, at its top surface, and also is airtightly in contact with the filter <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> at its bottom surface. The position of the interface between the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is such that when the ink jet head cartridge is placed in the same attitude as the ink jet head cartridge is in use, it is higher than the position of the uppermost portion of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> as a liquid passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are formed of fibrous material, and are held in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, so that in the state in which the ink jet head cartridge <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has been properly installed into the printer, its fibers extend in substantially the same, or primary, direction, being angled (preferably, in the virtually horizontal direction as they are in this embodiment) relative to the vertical direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> As for the material for the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the fibers of which are arranged in virtually the same direction, short (approximately 60 mm) crimped mixed strands of fiber formed of thermoplastic resin (polypropylene, polyethylene, and the like) are used. In production, a wad of such strands is put through a carding machine to parallel the strands, is heated (heating temperature is desired to be set higher than the melting point of polyethylene, which is relatively low, and lower than the molding point of polypropylene, which is relatively high), and then, is cut to a desired length. The fiber strands of the absorbent material pieces in this embodiment are greater in the degree of alignment in the surface portion than in the center portion, and therefore, the capillary force generated by the absorbent members is greater in the surface portion than in the center portion. However, the surfaces of the absorbent material pieces are not as flat as a mirror surface. In other words, they have a certain amount of unevenness which results mainly when the slivers are bundled; they are three dimensional, and the intersections of the slivers, at which they are welded to each other, are exposed from the surfaces of the absorbent material pieces. Thus, in strict terms, the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>between the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is an interface between the two uneven surfaces, allowing ink to flow by a proper amount in the horizontal direction along the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and also through the adjacencies of the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>In other words, it does not occur that ink is allowed to flow far more freely along the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>than through its adjacencies, and therefore, an ink path is formed through the gaps between the walls of the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and along the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Thus, by making a structural arrangement so that the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>between the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is above the uppermost portion of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, preferably, above and close to the uppermost portion of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> as in this embodiment, when the ink jet head cartridge is positioned in the same attitude as it is when in use, the position of the interface between the ink and gas in the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> during the gas-liquid exchange, which will be described later, can be made to coincide with the position of the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. As a result, the negative pressure in the head portion during the ink supplying operation can be stabilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, if attention is paid to the directionality of the strands of fiber in any portion of the fibrous absorbent material piece, it is evident that plural strands of fiber are extended in a direction F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, or the longitudinal direction of the absorbent material piece, in which the strands have been arranged by a carding machine. In terms of the direction F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> perpendicular to the direction F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the strands are connected to each other by being fused to each other at their intersections during the aforementioned heating process. Therefore, the fiber strands in the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are not likely to be separated from each other when the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is stretched in the direction F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. However, the fiber strands which are not likely to separate when pulled in the direction F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be easily separated at the intersections at which they have been fused with each other if the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is stretched in the direction F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Since the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> formed of the fiber strands possess the above described directionality in terms of the strand arrangement, the primary fiber direction, that is, the fiber direction F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is different from the fiber direction F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> perpendicular to the direction F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in terms of how ink flows through the absorbent pieces, and also in terms of how ink is statically held therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> To look at the internal structures of the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in more detail, the state of a wad of short strands of fiber crimped and carded as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), changes to the state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), as it is heated. More specifically, in a region a in which plural short strands of crimped fiber extend in an overlapping manner, more or less in the same direction, the fiber strands are likely to be fused to each other at their intersections, becoming connected as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and therefore, difficult to separate in the direction F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. On the other hand, the 21 tips of the short strands of crimped fiber (tips &bgr; and &ggr; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)) are likely to three-dimensionally fuse with other strands like the tip &bgr; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), or remain unattached like the tip &ggr; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). However, all the strands do extend in the same direction. In other words, some strands extend in the nonconforming direction and intersect with the adjacent strands (region &egr; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)) even before heat is applied, and as heat is applied, they fuse with the adjacent strands in the position they are in, (region &egr; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>)). Thus, compared to a conventional absorbent piece constituted of a bundle of unidirectionally arranged strands of fiber, the absorbent members in this embodiment are also far more difficult to split in the direction F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Further, in this embodiment, the absorbent pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are disposed so that the primary fiber strand direction F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the absorbent pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> becomes nearly parallel to the horizontal direction and the line which connects the joint portion and the ink supply outlet. Therefore, after the connection of ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the gas-liquid interface L (interface between ink and gas) in the absorbent piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> becomes nearly horizontal, that is, virtually parallel to the primary fiber strand direction F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, remaining virtually horizontal even if ambient changes occur, and as the ambience settles, the gas-liquid interface L returns to its original position. Thus, the position of the gas-liquid interface in terms of the gravitational direction is not affected by the number of the cycles of the ambient change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Thus, even when the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is replaced with a fresh one because the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> has run out of ink, the gas-liquid interface remains virtually horizontal, and therefore, the size of the buffering space <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> does not decrease no matter how many times the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> All that is necessary in order to keep the position of the gas-liquid interface stable in spite of the ambient changes during the gas-liquid exchange is that the fiber strands in the region immediately above the joint between the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (in the case of this embodiment, above the position of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>), preferably inclusive of the adjacencies of the region immediately above the joint, are extended in the more or less horizontal direction. From a different viewpoint, all that is necessary is that the above described region is between the ink delivery interface and the joint between the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. From another viewpoint, all that is necessary is that the position of this region is above the gas-liquid interface while gas-liquid exchange is occurring. To analyze the latter viewpoint with reference to the functionality of this region in which the fiber strands posses the above described directionality, this region contributes to keeping horizontal the gas-liquid interface in the absorbent piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> while the liquid is supplied through the gas-liquid exchange; in other words, the region contributes to regulate the changes which occur in the vertical direction in the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in response to the movement of the liquid into the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> from the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The provision of the above described region or layer in the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> makes it possible to reduce the unevenness of the gas-liquid interface L in terms of the gravity direction. Further, it is desired that the fiber strands in the aforementioned region or layer be arranged so that they appear to extend in parallel in the aforementioned primary direction even when they are seen from the direction perpendicular to the horizontal direction of the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, because such an arrangement enhances the effect of the directional arrangement of the fiber strands in the more or less parallel manner in the primary direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Regarding the direction in which the fiber strands are extended, theoretically, when the general direction in which the fiber strands are extended is angled relative to the vertical direction, the above described effect can be provided, although the amount of effect may be small if the angle is small. In practical terms, as long as the above described angle was in a range of &plusmn;30&deg; relative to the horizontal direction, the effect was clearly confirmed. Thus, the term &ldquo;more or less&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;more or less horizontal&rdquo; in this specification includes the above range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the fiber strands in the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are extended more or less in parallel in the primary direction also in the region below and adjacent to the joint portion, preventing therefore the gas-liquid interface L from becoming unpredictably uneven in the region below the uppermost portion of the joint portion, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, during the gas-liquid exchange. Therefore, it does not occur that the ink jet head cartridge fails to be supplied with a proper amount of ink due to the interruption of ink delivery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> More specifically, during the gas-liquid exchange, the outside air introduced through the air vent <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> reaches the gas-liquid interface L. As it reaches the interface L, it is dispersed along the fiber strands. As a result, the interface L is kept more or less horizontal during the gas-liquid exchange; it remains stable, assuring that the ink is supplied while a stable amount of negative pressure is maintained. Since the primary direction in which the fiber strands are extended in this embodiment is more or less horizontal, the ink is consumed through the gas-liquid exchange in such a manner that the top surface of the ink remains more or less horizontal, making it possible to provide an ink supplying system which minimizes the amount of the ink left unused, even the amount of the ink left unused in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in the case of an ink supplying system such as the system in this embodiment which allows the ink containing unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, in which liquid is directly stored, to be replaced, it is easier to provide the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> with regions in which ink is not retained. In other words, it is easier to increase the buffering space ratio, to provide an ink supplying system which is substantially more resistant to the ambient changes than a conventional ink supplying system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> When the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment is the type of cartridge mountable in a serial type printer, it is mounted on a carriage which is shuttled. As this carriage is shuttled, the ink in the ink jet head cartridge is subjected to the force generated by the movement of the carriage, more specifically, the component of the force in the direction of the carriage movement. In order to minimize the adverse effects of this force upon the ink delivery from the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, the direction of the fiber strands in the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the direction in which the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are connected, are desired to coincide with the direction of the line which connects the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the ink outlet <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> of the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Operation for Installing Ink Containing Unit </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the operation for installing the ink containing unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> into the integral combination of the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a sectional drawing for depicting the operation for installing the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> into the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to which the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has been attached. The ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is installed into the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> by being moved in the direction F as well as the direction G, while being slightly rotated by being guided by the unillustrated lateral guides, the bottom wall of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the guiding portions <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> with which the negative pressure controlling chamber cover <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the ink container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, that is, the rear end portion of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the installation of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> occurs as follows. First, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is moved to a point indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), that is, the point at which the slanted surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the ID members <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> with which the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is provided to prevent the wrong installation of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are structured so that at the point in time when the above described contact occurs, the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> has yet to enter the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. If a wrong ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is inserted, the slanted surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> of the wrong ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> collides with the ID members <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> at this point in time, preventing the wrong ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from being inserted further. With this structural arrangement of the ink jet head cartridge <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the wrong ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> does not make contact with joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the problems which occur at the joint portion as a wrong ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is inserted, for example, the mixture of inks with different color, and the solidification of ink in the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> (anions in one type of ink react with cations in another type of ink), which might cause the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to stop functioning, can be prevented, and therefore, it will never occurs that the head and ink containing portion of an apparatus, the ink containing portions of which are replaceable, needs to be replaced due to the occurrence of such problems. Further, since the ID portions of the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> are provided on the slanted surface of the ID member, the plurality of ID members <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> can be almost simultaneously fitted into the correspondent ID slots to confirm that a correct ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is being inserted; a reliable installation mistake prevention mechanism is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In the next step, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is moved toward the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> so that the ID members <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> are inserted into the ID member slots <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, respectively, at the same time, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), until the leading end of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> reaches the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). Next, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is rotationally moved in the direction indicated by an arrow mark G. During the rotational movement of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the tip of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> and pushes it. At a result, the valve mechanism opens, allowing the internal space of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to be connected to the internal space of the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, in other words, enabling the ink <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to be supplied into the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The detailed description of the opening or closing movement of this valve mechanism will be given later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Next, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is further rotated in the direction of the arrow mark G, until the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> settles as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As a result, the bottom rear end portion of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> becomes engaged with the ink container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>; in other words, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is correctly placed in the predetermined space for the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. During this second rotational movement of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the ID members <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> slightly come out of the ID member slots <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. The rearward force for correctly retaining the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the ink container unit space is generated toward the ink container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> by the resilient member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> in the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the rubber joint portion <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> fitted around the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Since the ID member slots <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> are provided in the slanted front wall of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which is rotationally installed or removed, and also, the bottom wall of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is slanted, it is possible to minimize the space necessary to assure that the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is installed or removed without making mistakes or mixing inks of different color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> As soon as the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is connected with the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as described above, the ink moves until the internal pressure of the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the internal pressure of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> equalize to realize the equilibrium state illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), in which the internal pressure of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> remains negative (this state is called &ldquo;initial state of usage&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> At this time, the ink movement which results in the aforementioned equilibrium will be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The valve mechanism provided in the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is opened by the installation of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Even after the opening of the valve mechanism, the ink holding portion of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> remains virtually sealed except for the small passage through the joint pipe <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. As a result, the ink in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> flows into the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, forming an ink path between the internal space of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As the ink path is formed, the ink begins to move from the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> into the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> because of the capillary force of the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. As a result, the ink-gas interface in the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> rises. Meanwhile, the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> begins to deform, starting from the center portion of the largest wall, in the direction to reduce the internal volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> functions to impede the displacement of the corner portions of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, countering the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> caused by the ink consumption. In other words, it works to preserve the pre-installation state of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (initial state illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>)). Therefore, the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> produces and maintains a proper amount of negative pressure correspondent to the amount of deformation, without suddenly deforming. Since the space between the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is connected to the outside through the air vent <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, air is introduced into the space between the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in response to the aforementioned deformation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Even if air is present in the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, this air easily moves into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> because the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> deforms as the ink in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is drawn out through the ink path formed as the ink from the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The ink movement continues until the amount of the static negative pressure in the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> becomes the same as the amount of the static negative pressure in the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> of the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> As described above, the ink movement from the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> into the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which is triggered by the connection of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> with the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, continues without the introduction of gas into the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> through the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. What is important to this process is to configure the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the type of a liquid jet recording means to which the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is connected, so that the static negative pressures in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> reach proper values for preventing ink from leaking from the liquid jet recording means such as the ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> which is connected to the ink outlet of the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> The amount of the ink held in the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> prior to the connection varies. Therefore, some regions in the absorbent piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> remain unfilled with ink. These regions can be used as the buffering regions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, sometimes the internal pressures of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> are caused to become positive due to the aforementioned variation. When there is such a possibility, a small amount of ink may be flowed out by performing a recovery operation with a suction-based recovering means, with which the main assembly of a liquid jet recording apparatus is provided, to deal with the possibility. This recovery means will be described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> As described before, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is installed into the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> through a movement which involves a slight rotation; it is inserted at an angle while resting on the ink container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, by its bottom wall, and after the bottom rear end of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> goes over the ink container engagement portion <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, it is pushed downward into the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. When the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is removed from the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the above described steps are reversely taken. The valve mechanism with which the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is provided is opened or closed as the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is installed or removed, respectively. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Opening or Closing of Valve Mechanism </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-(<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>), the operation for opening or closing the valve mechanism will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), shows the states of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and its adjacencies, and the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and its adjacencies, immediately before the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is inserted into the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, but after the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> was inserted into the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> at an angle so that the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> tilts slightly downward. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is provided with a sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which is integrally formed with the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, and extends on the peripheral surface of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, encircling the peripheral surface of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. It is also provided with a valve activation projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which forms the tip of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>comes into contact with the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> as the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is inserted into the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extends around the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> at an angle so that the distance from the uppermost portion of the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> becomes greater than the distance from the bottommost portion of the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> When the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is installed or removed, the joint sealing surface rubs against the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as will be described later. Therefore, the material for the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is desired to be such material that is slippery and yet capable of sealing between itself and an object it contacts. The configuration of the resilient member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> for keeping the valve plug <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>pressed upon or toward the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>does not need to be limited to a particular one; a springy member such as a coil spring or a plate spring, or a resilient member formed of rubber or the like, may be employed. However, in consideration of recycling, a resilient member formed of resin is preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> In the state depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the valve activation projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is yet to make contact with the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, and the seal portion of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, provided at the periphery of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, on the joint pipe side, is in contact with the seal portion of the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, with the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> being under the pressure from the resilient member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> remains airtightly sealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> As the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is inserted further into the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the joint portion is sealed at the sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> by the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. During this sealing process, first, the bottom side of the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>comes into contact with the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, gradually increasing the size of the contact area toward the top side of the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>while sliding against the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. Eventually, the top side of the sealing projecting <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>comes into contact with the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). As a result, the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>makes contact with the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, by the entire peripheral surface, sealing the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In the state illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), the valve activation projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is not in contact with the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, and therefore, the valve mechanism is not open. In other words, before the valve mechanism is opened, the gap between the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is sealed, preventing ink from leaking from the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> during the installation of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Further, as described above, the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is gradually sealed from the bottom side of the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. Therefore, until the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is sealed by the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the air in the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is discharged through the gap between the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. As the air in the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is discharged as described above, the amount of the air remaining in the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> after the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is sealed is minimized, preventing the air in the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> from being excessively compressed by the invasion of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> into the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, in other words, preventing the internal pressure of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> from rising excessively. Thus, it is possible to prevent the phenomenon that before the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is completely installed into the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the valve mechanism is inadvertently opened by the increased internal pressure of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and ink leaks into the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> As the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is further inserted, the valve activation projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>pushes the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> against the resiliency of the resilient member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>, with the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> remaining sealed by the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). As a result, the internal space of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> becomes connected to the internal space of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> through the opening <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the second valve body <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the air in the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is allowed to be drawn into the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through the opening <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>and the ink in the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is supplied into the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> As the air in the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is drawn into the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as described above, the negative pressure in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) is reduced, for example, when an ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> the ink in which has been partially consumed is re-installed. Therefore, the balance in the internal negative pressure between the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is improved, preventing the ink from being inefficiently supplied into the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> after the re-installation of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> After the completion of the above described steps, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is pushed down onto the bottom wall of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to finish installing the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> into the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>). As a result, the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is perfectly connected to the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, realizing the aforementioned state which assures that gas-liquid exchange occurs flawlessly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the opening <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is located adjacent to the valve body seal portion <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> and on the bottom side of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. According to the configuration of this opening <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, during the opening of the valve mechanism, more specifically, immediately after the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is moved toward the valve cover <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> by being pushed by the valve activation projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the ink in the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> begins to be supplied into the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Also, it is possible to minimize the amount of the ink which remains in the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> when the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> needs to be discarded because the ink therein can no longer be drawn out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Also in this embodiment, elastomer is used as the material for the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, that is, the seal portion, of the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>With the use of elastomer as the material for the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, it is assured that because of the resilience of the elastomer, the joint between the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is perfectly sealed, and also, the joint between the seal portion of the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the correspondent seal portion of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is perfectly sealed. In addition, by providing the elastomer with an amount of resiliency exceeding the minimum amount of resiliency necessary to assure that the joint between the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is perfectly sealed (for example, by increasing the thickness of the elastomer layer), the flexibility of elastomer compensates for the effects of the misalignment, twisting, and/or rubbing, which occur at the contact point between the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> during the serial scanning movement of an ink jet head cartridge; it is doubly assured that the joint remains perfectly sealed. The joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, the material for which is elastomer, can be integrally formed with the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, making it possible to provide the above described effects without increasing the number of components. Elastomer usage does not need to be limited to the above described structure; elastomer may also be used as the material for the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, the seal portion of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, when the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is removed from the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the above described installation steps occur in reverse, unsealing the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and allowing the valve mechanism to close. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> In other words, as the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is pulled in the direction to remove it from the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, while gradually rotating the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the direction opposite to the installation direction, first, the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> moves forward due to the resiliency of the resilient member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>, and presses on the seal portion of the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by its sealing surface to close the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Then, as the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is pulled out of the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the gap between the wall of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, which remained sealed by the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, is unsealed. Since this gap is unsealed after the closing of the valve mechanism, it does not occur that ink is wastefully released into the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is disposed at an angle as described before, the unsealing of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> occurs from the top side of the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Before the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is unsealed, ink remains in the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. However, it is at the top side where the unsealing starts. In other words, the bottom side remains sealed, preventing ink from leaking out of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Further, the internal pressure of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is negative, and therefore, as the joint is unsealed from the top side of the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the outside air enters into the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, causing the ink remaining in the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> to be drawn into the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> By causing the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to be unsealed starting from the top side of the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to make the ink remaining in the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> move into the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, it is possible to prevent ink from leaking from the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> as the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is removed from the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the structure of the junction between the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is sealed before the valve mechanism of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is activated, and therefore, ink is prevented from inadvertently leaking from the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Further, since a time lag is provided between the top and bottom sides of the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in terms of the sealing and unsealing timing, the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is prevented from inadvertently moving during the connection, and the ink remaining in the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is prevented from leaking during the connection and during the removal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Also in this embodiment, the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is disposed in the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, at a point deeper inside the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, away from the outside opening of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and the movement of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is controlled by the valve activation projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>provided at the projecting end of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a user is not required to touch the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, being prevented from being contaminated by the ink adhering to the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Relationship between Engagement or Disengagement of Joint Portion, and ID </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the relationship between the engagement or disengagement of the joint portion, and ID will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> are drawings for depicting the steps for installing the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> into the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, wherein FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), and (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), correspondingly represent the same steps. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> show in detail the portion related to ID, and the joint portion, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> In the first step, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is inserted up to the position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), at which the plurality of ID members <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> for preventing the ink container unit installation error make contact with the slanted wall <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> of the ink container. The holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are structured so that at this point in time, the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> do not make contact. If a wrong ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is inserted, the slanted surface <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> of the wrong ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> collides with the ID members <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> at this point in time, preventing the wrong ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from being inserted further. With this structural arrangement, the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the wrong ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> never makes contact with joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the problems which occur at the joint portion as a wrong ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is inserted, for example, the mixture of inks with different color, ink solidification, production of incomplete images, and breaking down of the apparatus, can be prevented, and therefore, it never occurs that the head and ink containing portion of an apparatus, the ink containing portions of which are replaceable, will be replaced due to the occurrence of such problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> If the inserted ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is a correct one, the positions of the ID members <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> match the positions of the ID member slots <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is inserted a little deeper toward the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to a position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). At this position, the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has come into contact with the bottom side of the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the both sides are completely joined through the steps described before, providing a passage between the internal space of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the internal space of the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In the above described embodiment, the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is an integral part of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. However, the two components may be separately formed. In such a case, the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is fitted around the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, being loosely held by a projection formed on the peripheral surface of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, or a groove provided in the peripheral surface of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, so that the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is allowed to move on the peripheral surface of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. However, the joint portion is structured so that within the moving range of the independent sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the valve action controlling projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>does not make contact with the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> until the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>comes into contact with the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In the above description of this embodiment, it is described that as the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is further inserted, the bottom side of the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>comes into contact with the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, and the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>slides on the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, gradually expanding the contact range between the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, upward toward the top side of the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, until the top end of the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>finally comes into contact with the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. However, the installation process may be such that, first, the top side of the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>comes into contact with the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, and as the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is further inserted, the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>slides on the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, gradually expanding the contact range between the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, downward toward the bottom end of the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, until the bottom end of the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>finally makes contact with the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Further, the contact between the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may occur simultaneously at both the top and bottom sides. During the above process, if the air present between the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> opens the valve mechanism by pushing the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> inward of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the ink <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> within the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> does not leak outward, because the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> has been completely sealed at the joint between the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. In other words, the essential point of this invention is that the valve mechanism is opened only after the joint between the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is completely sealed. According to this structure, it does not occur that the ink <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> within the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> leaks out during the installation of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In addition, the air pushed into the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> enters the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and pushes out the ink <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> into the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, contributing to smoothly supplying ink from the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> into the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Ink Supplying Operation </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the ink supplying operation of the ink jet head cartridge illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> will be described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a sectional drawing for describing the ink supplying operation of the ink jet head cartridge illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> By dividing the absorbent material in the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> into a plurality of pieces, and positioning the interface between the divided pieces of the absorbent material so that the interface will be positioned above the top end of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> when the ink jet head cartridge is disposed in the attitude in which it is used, as described above, it becomes possible to consume the ink within the absorbent piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, or the bottom piece, after the ink within the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, or the top piece, if ink is present in both the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the ink jet head cartridge illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Further, if the position of the gas-liquid interface L changes due to the ambient changes, ink seeps into the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> after filling up, first, the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the adjacencies of the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>between the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is assured that buffering zone in addition to the buffering space <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is provided in the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Making the strength of the capillary force of the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> higher compared to that of the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> assures that the ink in the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is consumed when the ink jet head cartridge is operating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Further, in this embodiment, the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> remains pressed toward the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> by the ribs of the negative pressure controlling chamber cover <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and therefore, the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is kept in contact with the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, forming the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The compression ratios of the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are higher adjacent to the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>than those in the other portions, and therefore, the capillary force is greater adjacent to the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>than that in the other portions. More specifically, representing the capillary force of the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the capillary force of the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and the capillary force of the area adjacent to the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>between the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, with P1, P2, and PS, correspondingly, their relationship is: P2&lt;P1&lt;PS. Providing the area adjacent to the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>between the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> with such capillary force that is stronger than that in the other areas assures that the strength of the capillary force in the area adjacent to the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>exceeds the strength necessary to meet the above described requirement, even if the ranges of the strengths of the P1 and P2 overlap with each other because of the unevenness of the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in terms of their density, or compression. Therefore, it is assured that the above described effects will be provided. Further, positioning the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> below, and adjacent to, the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>between the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> assures that the gas-liquid interface remains at this position, and therefore, is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, next, the method for forming the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>in this embodiment, will be described. In this embodiment, olefinic fiber (2 denier) with a capillary force of &minus;110 mmAq (P1&equals;&minus;110 mmAq) is used as the material for the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> as a capillary force generating member. The hardness of the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is 0.69 kgf/mm. The method for measuring their hardness is such that, first, the resilient force generated as a pushing rod with a diameter of 15 mm is pushed against the absorbent material placed in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is measured, and then, the hardness is obtained from the relationship between the distance the pushing rod was inserted, and the measured amount of the resilient force correspondent to the distance. On the other hand, the same material as that for the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, that is, olefinic fiber, is used as the material for the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. However, compared to the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is made weaker in capillary force (P2&equals;&minus;80 mmAq), and is made larger in the fiber diameter (6 denier), making it higher in rigidity at 1.88 kgf/mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> By making the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, which is weaker in capillary force than the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, greater in hardness than the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, placing them in combination, and in contact, with each other, and keeping them pressed against each other, causes the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to be kept more compressed than the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, adjacent to the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>between the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the aforementioned relationship in capillary force (P2&lt;P1&lt;PS) is established adjacent to the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and also it is assured that the difference between the P2 and PS remains always greater than the difference between the P2 and P1. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the outlines of the ink consuming process will be described from the time when the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has been installed into the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and has become connected to the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, to the time when the ink in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> begins to be consumed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a drawing for describing the state of the ink during the ink consumption described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a graph for depicting the effects of the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> upon the prevention of the internal pressure change in the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> First, as the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is connected to the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the ink in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> moves into the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> until the internal pressure of the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> becomes equal to the internal pressure of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, readying the ink jet head cartridge for a recording operation. Next, as the ink begins to be consumed by the ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, both the ink in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the ink in the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are consumed, maintaining such a balance that the value of the static negative pressure generated by the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> increases (first state: range A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)). In this state, when ink is in the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the ink in the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is also consumed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a graph for describing one of the examples of the rate at which the negative pressure in the ink delivery tube <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> varies. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the axis of abscissa represents the rate at which the ink is drawn out of the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the ink delivery tube <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, and the axis of ordinates represents the value of the negative pressure (static negative pressure) in the ink delivery tube <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Next, gas is drawn into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, allowing ink to be consumed, that is, drawn out, through gas-liquid exchange while the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> keep the position of the gas-liquid interface L at about the same level, and keep the internal negative pressure substantially constant (second state: range B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)). Then, the ink remaining in the capillary pressure generating member holding chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is consumed (range C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> As described above, the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment goes through the stage (first stage) in which the ink in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is used without the introduction of the outside air into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the only requirement to be considered regarding the internal volume of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is the amount of the air introduced into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> during the connection. Therefore, the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment has merit in that it can compensate for the ambient changes, for example, temperature change, even if the requirement regarding the internal volume of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is relaxed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> Further, in whichever period among the aforementioned periods A, B, and C, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is replaced, it is assured that the proper amount of negative pressure is generated, and therefore, ink is reliably supplied. In other words, in the case of the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment, the ink in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can be almost entirely consumed. In addition, air may be present in the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and/or joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> when the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is replaced, and the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can be replaced regardless of the amounts of the ink retained in the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is possible to provide an ink jet head cartridge which allows the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to be replaced without relying on an ink remainder detection mechanism; in other words, the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment does not need to be provided with an ink remainder detection mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> At this time, the aforementioned ink consumption sequence will be described from a different viewpoint, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is a graph for describing the above described ink consumption sequence. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the axis of abscissas represents the elapsed time, and the axis of ordinates represents the cumulative amount of the ink drawn out of the ink storing container, and the cumulative amount of the air drawn into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. It is assumed that the rate at which the ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is provided with ink remains constant throughout the elapsed time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> The ink consumption sequence will be described from the angles of the cumulative amount of the ink drawn out of the ink containing portion, and the cumulative amount of the air drawn into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the cumulative amount of the ink drawn out of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is represented by a solid line (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), and the cumulative amount of the air drawn into the ink containing portion is represented by a solid line (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). A period from a time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> to t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponds to the period A, or the period before the gas-liquid exchange begins, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). In this period A, the ink from the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is drawn out of the head while balance is maintained between the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Next, the period from time t<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> corresponds to the gas-liquid exchange period (period B) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). In this period B, the gas-liquid exchange continues according to the negative pressure balance, as described above. As air is introduced into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (which corresponds to the stepped portions of the solid line (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)), as indicated by the solid line (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), ink is drawn out of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. During this process, it does not occur that ink is always drawn out of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> by an amount equal to the amount of the introduced air. For example, sometimes, ink is drawn out of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> a certain amount of time after the air introduction, by an amount equivalent to the amount of the introduced air. As is evident from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the occurrence of this kind of reaction, or the timing lag, characterizes the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment in comparison to an ink jet head cartridge which does not have an internal ink bladder (<highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>), and the ink containing portion of which does not deform. As described above, this process is repeated during the gas-liquid exchange period. As the ink in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> continues to be drawn out, the relationship between the amounts of the air and ink in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> reverses at a certain point in time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> The period after the time t<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> corresponds to the period (range C) after the gas-liquid exchange period in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). In this range C, the internal pressure of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> becomes substantially the same as the atmospheric pressure as stated before. As the internal pressure of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> gradually changes toward the atmospheric pressure, the initial state (pre-usage state) is gradually restored by the resiliency of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. However, because of the so-called buckling, it does not occur that the state of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is completely restored to its initial state. Therefore the final amount Vc of the air drawn into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is smaller than the initial internal volume of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (V&gt;Vc). Even in the state within the range C, the ink in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can be completely consumed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> As described above, the structure of the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment is characterized in that the pressure fluctuation (amplitude &ggr; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)) which occurs during the gas-liquid exchange in the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment is greater compared to that in an ink jet head cartridge which employs a conventional ink container system in which gas-liquid exchange occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> The reason for this characteristic is that before the gas-liquid exchange begins, the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is deformed, and kept deformed, by the drawing of the ink from inside the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the resiliency of the internal bladder material continuously generates such force that works in the direction to move the wall of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> outward. As a result, the amount of the air which enters the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to reduce the internal pressure difference between the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> during the gas-liquid exchange often exceeds the proper amount, as described, increasing the amount of the ink drawing out of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> into the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. On the contrary, if the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is structured so that the wall of the ink containing portion does not deform as does the wall of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, ink is immediately drawn out into the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as soon as a certain amount of air enters the ink containing portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> For example, in 100% duty mode (solid mode), a large amount of ink is ejected all at once from the ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, causing ink to be rapidly drawn out of the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. However, in the case of the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment, the amount of the ink drawn out through gas-liquid exchange is relative large, improving the reliability, that is, eliminating the concern regarding the interruption of ink flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Also, according to the structure of the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment, ink is drawn out with the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> remaining deformed inward, providing thereby an additional benefit in that the structure offers a higher degree of buffering effect against the vibration of the carriage, ambient changes, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the structure of the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment, the slight changes in the negative pressure can be eased by the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and even when air is present in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, for example, during the second stage in the ink delivery, the ambient changes such as temperature change can be compensated for by a method different from the conventional methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> mechanism for assuring that even when the ambient condition of the ink jet head cartridge illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> changes, the liquid within the unit remains stable will be described. In the following description, the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be called a capillary force generating member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> As the air in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> expands due to decrease in the atmospheric pressure and/or increase in the temperature, the walls or the like portions of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and the liquid surface in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, are subjected to pressure. As a result, not only does the internal volume of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> increase, but also a portion of the ink in internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> flows out into the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> from the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> through the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. However, since the internal volume of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> increases, the amount of the ink that flows out into the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in the case of this embodiment is substantially smaller compared to a case in which the ink storage portion is undeformable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> As described above, the aforementioned changes in the atmospheric pressure ease the negative pressure in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and increase the internal volume of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Therefore, initially, the amount of the ink which flows out into the negative pressure controlling chamber shell through the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> as the atmospheric pressure suddenly changes is substantially affected by the resistive force generated by the internal bladder wall as the inward deformation of the wall portion of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is eased, and by the resistive force for moving the ink so that the ink is absorbed by the capillary force generating member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> In particular, in the case of the structure in this embodiment, the flow resistance of the capillary force generating members (absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>) is greater than the resistance of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> against the restoration of the original state. Therefore, as the air expands, initially, the internal volume of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> increases. Then, as the amount of the air expansion exceeds the maximum amount of the increase in the internal volume of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> afforded by the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, ink begins to flows from within the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> toward the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. In other words, the wall of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> functions as the buffer against the ambient changes, and therefore, the ink movement in the capillary force generating member calms down, stabilizing the negative pressure adjacent to the ink delivery hole <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Also according to this embodiment, the ink which flows out into the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is retained by the capillary force generating members. In the aforementioned situation, the amount of the ink in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> increases temporarily, causing the gas-liquid interface to rise, and therefore, in comparison to when the internal pressure is stable, the internal pressure temporarily becomes slightly positive, as it is initially. However, the effect of this slightly positive internal pressure upon the characteristics of a liquid ejection recording means such as the ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, in terms of ejection, creates no practical problem. As the atmospheric pressure returns to the normal level (base unit of atmospheric pressure), or the temperature returns to the original level, the ink which leaked out into the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and has been retained in the capillary force generating members, returns to the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> restores its original internal volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Next, the basic action in the stable condition restored under such atmospheric pressure that has changed after the initial operation will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> What characterizes this state is the amount of the ink drawn out of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, as well as that the position of the interface between the ink retained in the capillary force generating member, and the gas, changes to compensate for the fluctuation of the negative pressure resulting from the fluctuation of the internal volume of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> itself. Regarding the relationship between the amount of the ink absorbed by the capillary force generating member and the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, all that is necessary from the viewpoint of preventing ink from leaking from the air vent or the like during the aforementioned decrease in the atmospheric pressure and temperature change, is to determine the maximum amount of the ink to be absorbed by the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the amount of the ink to be retained in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> while the ink is supplied from the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, in consideration of the amount of the ink which flows out of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> under the worst conditions, and then, to give the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> an internal volume sufficient for holding the capillary force generating members, the sizes of which match the aforementioned amount of ink under the worst conditions, and the maximum amount of the ink to be absorbed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the initial volume of the internal space (volume of the air) of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> before the decrease in the atmospheric pressure, in a case in which the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> does not deform at all in response to the expansion of the air, is represented by the axis of abscissas (X), and the amount of the ink which flowed out as the atmospheric pressure decreased to a value of P (0&lt;P&lt;1) is represented by the axis of ordinates, and their relationship is depicted by a dotted line (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The amount of the ink which flows out of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> under the worst conditions may be estimated based on the following assumption. For example, a situation in which the amount of the ink which flows out of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> becomes the maximum when the lowest level to which the value of the atmospheric pressure decreases is 0.7, is when the volume of the ink remaining in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> equals 30% of the volumetric capacity VB of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Therefore, presuming that the ink below the bottom end of the wall of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is also absorbed by the capillary force generating members in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, it may be expected that the entirety of the ink remaining in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (equals in volume to 30% of the volumetric capacity VB) leaks out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> On the contrary, in this embodiment, the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> deforms in response to the expansion of the air. In other words, compared to the internal volume of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> before the expansion, the internal volume of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is greater after the expansion, and the ink level in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> changes to compensate for the fluctuation of the negative pressure in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Under the stable condition, the ink level in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> changes to compensate for the decrease in the negative pressure in the capillary force generating members, in comparison to the negative pressure in the capillary force generating members before the change in the atmospheric pressure, caused by the ink from the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In other words, the amount of the ink which flows out decreases in proportion to the amount of the expansion of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, as depicted by a solid line (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). As is evident from the dotted line (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and solid line (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), the amount of the ink which flows out of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be estimated to be smaller compared to that in the case in which the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> does not deform at all in response to the expansion of the air. The above described phenomenon similarly occurs in the case of the change in the temperature of the ink container, except that even if the temperature increases approximately 50 degrees, the amount of the ink outflow is smaller than the aforementioned amount of the ink outflow in response to the atmospheric pressure decrease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> As described above, the ink container in accordance with the present invention can compensate for the expansion of the air in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> caused by the ambient changes not only because of the buffering effect provided by the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, but also because of the buffering effect provided by the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> which is enabled to increase in its volumetric capacity to the maximum value at which the shape of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> becomes substantially the same as the shape of the internal space of the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is possible to provide an ink supplying system which can compensate for the ambient changes even if the ink capacity of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is substantially increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) schematically shows the amount of the ink drawn out of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the internal volume of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, in relation to the length of the elapsed time, when the ambient pressure is reduced from the normal atmospheric pressure to the pressure value of P (0&lt;P&lt;1). In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the initial volume of the air is VA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and a time t<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is a point in time at which the ambient pressure is the normal atmospheric pressure, and from which the reduction in the ambient pressure begins. The axis of abscissas represents time (t) and the axis of ordinates represents the amount of the ink drawn out of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the internal volume of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The changes in the amount of the ink drawn out of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in relation to the elapsed time is depicted by a solid line (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), and the change in the volume of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in relation to the elapsed time is depicted by a solid line (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), when a sudden ambient change occurs, the compensation for the expansion of the air is made mainly by the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> before the normal state, in which the negative pressure in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> balances with the negative pressure in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, is finally restored. Therefore, at the time of sudden ambient change, the timing with which the ink is drawn out into the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> from the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can be delayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is possible to provide an ink supplying system capable of supplying ink under the stable negative pressure condition during the usage of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, while compensating the expansion of the air introduced in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> through gas-liquid exchange, under various usage conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> According to the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment, the volumetric ratio between the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> can be optimally set by optionally selecting the material for the capillary force generating members (ink absorbent pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>), and the material for the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>; even if the ratio is greater than 1:2, practical usage is possible. In particular, when emphasis needs to be placed on the buffering effect of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, all that is necessary is to increase, within the range in which the elastic deformation is possible, the amount of the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> during the gas-liquid exchange, relative to the initial state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> As described above, according to the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment, although the capillary force generating members occupies only a small portion of the internal volume of the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, it is still effective to compensate for the changes in the ambient condition, by synergistically working with the structure of the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment, the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is located adjacent to the bottom end of the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. This arrangement is effective to reduce the uneven distribution of the ink in the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. This effect will be described below in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> The ink from the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is supplied to the ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> through the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. However, between the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and ink delivery tube <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, the ink takes a different path depending on the situation. For example, the shortest path, that is, the path taken by the ink in a situation in which the ink is directly supplied, is substantially different from the path taken in a situation in which the ink goes, first, to the top of the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> due to the rise of the liquid surface of the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> caused by the aforementioned ambient changes. This difference creates the aforementioned uneven ink distribution, which sometimes affects recording performance. This variation in the ink path, that is, the difference in the length of the ink path, can be reduced to reduce the unevenness of the ink distribution, by positioning the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> adjacent to the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, as it is according to the structure of the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment, so that the unevenness in the recording performance is reduced. Thus, it is desired that the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> are placed as close as possible to the top portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> However, in consideration of the need to provide the buffering performance, they are placed at reasonably high positions as they are in this embodiment. These positions are optionally chosen in consideration of various factors, for example, the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, ink, amount by which ink is supplied, amount of ink, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> which generates a capillary force with a value of P1 and the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> which generates a capillary force with a value of P2 are placed in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, in contact with each other, in a compressed state, generating a capillary force with a value of PS. The relationship in the strength among these capillary forces is: P2&lt;P1&lt;PS. In other words, the capillary force generated at the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is the strongest, and the capillary force generated in the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, or the absorbent material piece on the top side, is the weakest. Because the capillary force generated at the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is the strongest, and the capillary force generated in the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, or the absorbent material piece on the top side, is the weakest, even if the ink supplied through the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> flows into the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> on the top side past the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>the ink is pulled with strong force toward the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>and moves back toward the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. With the presence of this interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>it does not occur that the path J forms a line through both the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. For this reason, in addition to the fact that the position of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is higher than that of the supply opening <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, the difference in length between the path K and path J can be reduced. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the difference in the effect which ink receives from the absorbent material piece <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which occurs as the ink path through the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> varies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> Further, in this embodiment, the ink absorbing member as the negative pressure generating member placed in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> comprises two pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of absorbent material, which are different in capillary force. The piece with stronger capillary force is used as the piece for the bottom side. The positioning of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> below, and adjacent to, the interface <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>between the absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> assures that the shifting of the ink path is controlled while providing a reliable buffering zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> As for an ink delivery port, the ink delivery port <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> located at the approximate center of the bottom wall of the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is described as an example. However, the choice is not limited to the ink delivery port <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>; if necessary, an ink delivery port may be moved away from the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>; in other words, it may be positioned at the left end of the bottom wall, or adjacent to the left sidewall. With such modifications, the position of the ink jet head unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, with which the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is provided, and the position of the ink delivery tube <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, may also be correspondingly altered to the left end of the bottom wall, or the adjacency of the left sidewall. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the valve mechanism provided inside the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the above described ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), is a front view of the relationship between the second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), a lateral and vertically sectional view of the second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>); <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), a front view of the relationship between the second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and the valve plug <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> which has slightly rotated; and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), is a lateral and vertically sectional view of the second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and valve plug <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the front end of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is elongated in one direction, enlarging the cross-sectional area of the opening, to enhance the ink supplying performance of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. However, if the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is widened in the width direction perpendicular to the lengthwise direction of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the space which the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> occupies increases, leading to increase in the apparatus size. This configuration is particularly effective when a plurality of ink containers are placed side by side in terms of the widthwise direction (direction of the scanning movement of the carriage), in parallel to each other, to accommodate the recent trends, that is, colorization and photographic printing. Therefore, in this embodiment, the shape of the cross section of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, that is, the ink outlet of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is made oblong. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> In addition, in the case of the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment, the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> has two roles: the role of supplying the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> with ink, and the role of guiding the atmospheric air into the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Thus, the fact that the shape of the cross section of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is oblong in the direction parallel to the gravity direction makes it easier to give the top and bottom sides of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> different functions, that is, that is, to allow the top side to essentially function as the air introduction path, and the bottom side to essentially function as the ink supply path, assuring that gas-liquid exchange occurs flawlessly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> As described above, as the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is installed, the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> of the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is inserted into the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. As a result, the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is pushed by the valve activation projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>located at the end of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the valve mechanism of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> opens, allowing the ink in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to be supplied into the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Even if the valve activation projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>misses the exact center of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> as it comes into contact with the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> to push it, because of the attitude of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> when the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is engaged with the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the twisting of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> can be avoided because the cross section of the end portion of the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>placed on the peripheral surface of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is semicircular. Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), in order to allow the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> to smoothly slide during the above process, a clearance <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> is provided between the joint sealing surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> in the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and the circumference of the first valve body side of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> In addition, at the end of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, at least the top portion has an opening, and therefore, when the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is inserted into the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, there is no hindrance to the formation of the essential air introduction path through the top sides of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Therefore, an efficient gas-liquid exchange is possible. On the contrary, during the removal of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, as the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> separates from the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is slid forward, that is, toward the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, by the resilient force which it receives from the resilient member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>. As a result, the seal portion <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> of the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> engage with each other, closing the ink supply path, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a perspective view of the end portion of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, and depicts an example of the shape of the end portion. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the top side of the end portion of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> with the aforementioned oblong cross section is provided with an opening <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the bottom side of the end portion of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is provided with an opening <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The bottom side opening <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is an ink path, and the top side opening <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is an air path, although ink is occasionally passed through the top side opening <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> The value of the force applied to the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> by the resilient member to keep the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> in contact with the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is set so that it remains substantially the same even if a pressure difference occurs between the inside and outside of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> due to the changes in the environment in which the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is used. If the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is returned to the closed position after the above described ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is used at high altitude with an atmospheric pressure of 0.7, and then, the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is carried to an environment with an atmospheric pressure of 1.0, the internal pressure of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> becomes lower than the atmospheric pressure. As a result, the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is pressed in the direction to open the valve mechanism. In the case of this embodiment, the force FA applied to the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> by the atmospheric pressures is calculated by the following formula: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>FA&equals;</italic></highlight>1.01&times;10<highlight><superscript>5</superscript></highlight>(<highlight><italic>N/m</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) (&equals;1.0), </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> whereas the force FB applied to the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> by the gas in the ink container is obtained from the following formula: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>FB&equals;</italic></highlight>0.709&times;10<highlight><superscript>5</superscript></highlight>(<highlight><italic>N/m</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) (&equals;0.7). </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> The constant force FV necessary to be generated by the resilient member to keep the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> in contact with the valve body must satisfy the following requirement: </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> This value applies to a situation in which the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is in contact with the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>under pressure. When the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is apart from the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, that is, after the amount of the deformation of the deformation of the resilient member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>for generating the force applied to the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> has increased, the value of the force applied to the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> by the resilient member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> in the direction to push the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> toward the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is greater, which is evident. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> In the case of the above described valve structure, there is a possibility that it suffers from a phenomenon called &ldquo;twisting&rdquo;. More specifically, the coefficient of friction at the interface between the valve activation projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> sometimes increases due to the adhesion of solidified ink or the like. If such a situation occurs, the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> fails to slide on the surface of the valve activation projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>upon which it was intended to slide. As a result, as the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is rotationally moved, the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> strokes while being pushed, being thereby twisted, in the upward direction in the drawing by the valve activation projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> Thus, hereinafter, the configuration of a valve capable of compensating for the effect of the twisting (clogging) phenomenon upon the sealing performance will be described, along with the comparative examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows an example of a valve mechanism, which is compared with the valve mechanism in this embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</cross-reference> show the twisting in the valve mechanism illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, and the state in which the joint is sealed. In the case of the comparative example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> clearance <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> provided between a valve plug <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> with an oblong cross section and a second valve body <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to facilitate the stroking of the valve plug <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, is even. The valve plug <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is pressed upon a first valve body <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by a resilient member <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> to keep the sealing surface <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the valve plug <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, that is, the surface of the tapered, second valve body side of the valve plug <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, tightly in contact with the tapered seal portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the first valve body <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, to seal a joint opening <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, if the above described twisting phenomenon occurs in the above described structure of the comparative example, the valve plug <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> makes contact with the second valve body <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at two areas, that is, a contact surface <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a contact surface <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Representing the distance between these two contact surfaces, and the amount of the clearance, with X and Y, the twist angle &thgr; is: &thgr;&equals;tan<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>(2Y/X). Assuming that the clearance remains the same, the greater the distance X between the two contact surfaces, the smaller the value of the twist angle &thgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> In the case of this comparative example, however, the length X of the contact surface is relatively small (compared to the valve plug diameter, for example), rendering the twist angle &thgr; relatively large. In other words, in order to rectify the twisting, a rotational motion with a relatively large angle is necessary. Therefore, it is evident that the probability that the twisting is rectified after its occurrence is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, if a contact is made with the first valve body <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>without rectification of the twisting, the tapered seal portion <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the valve plug <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> becomes different in the contact radius from the tapered seal portion <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the first valve body <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. As a result, the contact portions fail to make perfect contact with each other, allowing ink leakage to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> The second valve body <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a valve cover <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> are welded by ultrasonic waves. The valve cover in the comparative example is a simple flat one, raising the possibility that the ultrasonic waves causes misalignment, that is, the accuracy with which the center hole of the valve cover <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, though which the sliding axis <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the valve plug <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is put, varies, making it necessary to enlarge the center hole of the valve cover <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to prevent the wall of the hole of the valve cover <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> from contacting the sliding axis <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the valve plug <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. Consequently, it becomes difficult to reduce the size of the resilient member <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, and therefore, it becomes difficult to reduce the size of the entirety of the valve mechanism, because the minimum diameter of the resilient member <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is dependent upon the diameter of the hole of the valve cover <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> In contrast to the above described comparative example, the valve mechanism in this embodiment has the following structure. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows the valve mechanism in this embodiment of the present invention, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</cross-reference> show the twisting of the valve mechanism in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, and the state of the relationship between the two seal portions. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, in this embodiment, the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is tapered in terms of the stroke direction (rightward direction in the drawing); the diameter (at least, length of the major axis) of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> gradually reduces in terms of the rightward direction. The interior wall of the second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is tapered so that its diameter gradually increases in terms of the stroke (rightward) direction. With this structural arrangement, in order for the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> to come into contact with the second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at a position equivalent to the contact surface <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the comparative example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> when the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is twisted, a substantially larger angle is necessary, and before the angle of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> reaches this substantially large angle, the sliding axis of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the wall of the hole of the valve cover <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>). Thus, the length of X of the contact surface can be set to be longer, making it possible to reduce the amount of the twist angle &thgr;. Therefore, even if the twisted valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is placed in contact with the first valve body <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>without being rectified in its twist as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the twist angle &thgr; is extremely small compared to the comparative example; the interfaces between the seal portion <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> and the seal portion <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> of the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are better sealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> It should be noted here that representing the length of the contact surface, and the clearance between the sliding axis of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> and the hole of the valve cover <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, with X and Y1: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> The valve cover <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is provided with a valve cover welding guide <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which is a stepped portion (depth of penetration by the valve cover: 0.8 mm), and comes in contact with the edge of the second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as the valve cover <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is pushed into the second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Therefore, the hole of the valve cover <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, through which the sliding axis of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is put, is rendered smaller than that in the comparative example. In other words, the provision of the valve cover <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> with the welding guide <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>reduces the amount of the misalignment between the second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the valve cover <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> which is caused by the vibrations occurring during the welding between the two components, and therefore, the accuracy with which the hole of the valve cover <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> is positioned is improved. Thus, it becomes possible to reduce the diameter of the hole of the valve cover <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, which makes it possible to reduce the diameter of the resilient member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>. Consequently, it becomes possible to reduce the size of the valve mechanism. Further, even if force is applied by the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> through the sliding axis of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> due to the twisting of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, the rigidity of the valve cover <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> is secured by the valve cover welding guide <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> The ridge line portion of the hole of the valve cover <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> is provided with an R portion <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>This R portion <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is provided at only the ridge line on the non-welding surface side (right-hand side in the drawing). With the provision of this arrangement, the friction between the sliding axis of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> and the valve cover <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> during the movement, in particular, the opening movement, of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> in the twisted state, can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> The end portion of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, which comes into contact with the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, is a seal portion <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, which has a flat surface. In contrast, the portion of the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which the seal portion <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> contacts, is the seal portion <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> of the first valve body sealing portion <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, that is, the surface of a piece of elastomer <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> placed on the interior surface of the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Flattening the seal portion of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> and first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>equalizes the contact radii of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> having the oblong cross section, with the R portion of the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a; </italic></highlight>perfect contact is made between the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> and first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In addition, the seal portion <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> of the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is shaped like a tongue sticking out of a mouth, assuring further that the interfaces between the two components are flawlessly sealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> In the case of a valve mechanism structured as described above, if clearance is provided between the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> and second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, it occurs sometimes that the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> rotates about its axis, within the second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, during the installation or removal of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). In this embodiment, however, even if the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is rotated about its axis to the maximum angle, and then, is pressed upon the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>while remaining in the maximumly rotated state, the contact between the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> and first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is by their seal portions <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, respectively; in other words, the contact is made surface to surface. Therefore, it is assured that the valve mechanism is airtightly sealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> In addition, since the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and valve mechanism are shaped so that their cross sections become oblong, the rotational angle of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> during the sliding of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> can be minimized, and also, the valve response can be improved. Therefore, it is possible to assure that the valve mechanism of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> flawlessly functions in terms of sealing performance. Further, since the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and valve mechanism are shaped so that their cross sections become oblong, the projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for sealing, provided on the peripheral surface of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, swiftly slide through the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> during the installation or removal of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, assuring that the connecting operation ensues smoothly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the end portion of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, which makes contact with the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, comprises two symmetrical absorbent material pieces <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>There are the opening <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for gas-liquid exchange, on the top side of the end portion of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and the opening <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for supplying liquid, on the bottom side. Therefore, a study was made regarding the idea of providing the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> with a pair of contact ribs <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> as counterparts to the projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which are to be positioned on the areas excluding the sealing portion <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> which is placed tightly in contact with the sealing portion <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> of the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). However, during the opening of the valve, the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is pushed back by the force from the resilient member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>, and therefore, the rib portions are required to have a certain amount of rigidity, high enough to prevent the deformation of the rib portions. In addition, regarding the positioning and shapes of the contact rib portions, it is required, from the viewpoint of reliability, that even if the positions of the contact rib portions of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> shift in the radial direction of the sliding axis of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, relative to the two valve activation projections <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, the moments which generate at the two contact rib portions which oppose each other across the sliding axis <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, cancel each other. Therefore, in this embodiment, the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is provided with a circular rib <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> (0.6 mm in width and 1.3 mm in height), which is similar in cross section to the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> which has the oblong cross section, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). In other words, the surface of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, on the first valve body side, excluding the sealing portion <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> which is placed in contact with the sealing portion <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> of the first valve body <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, is provided with an oblong recess <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the center of which coincides with the axial line of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. This structure provides the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> with the strength and reliability required when the valve activation projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>makes contact with the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. Making the rib circular, and making the center of the recess coincide with the axial line of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, could improve the moldability of the valve plug <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. From this viewpoint, regarding moldability, it is desired that the base portion of the circular rib, on the recess side, be given a minuscule curvature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, during the assembly of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is attached by welding and interlocking, after the valve mechanism comprising the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is inserted into the ink delivery opening of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. In particular, the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is exposed at the edge of the opening of the ink delivery opening of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and the flange <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> of the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the valve mechanism is welded to this exposed portion <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is welded at the location of the flange <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>, and is interlocked with the engagement portions <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the container external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> In the case of this type of assembly, for example, the flange <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> of the first valve body, to which the ID member <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> is attached, is flat as it is in the case of the comparative example illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>; the elastomer layer <highlight><bold>567</bold></highlight> is not exposed at the edge of the ink delivery opening with which the ID member <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> is provided, and therefore, there is a possibility that seal leakage may occur during the process, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, for connecting the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. Thus, in this embodiment, the welding surface of the flange <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> of the first valve body, to which the ID member <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> is welded, and which was in the same plane as the plane of the opening of the joint opening <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, has been moved in the direction opposite to the container installation direction. In other words, the first valve body flange <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> is positioned so that when the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is glued to the first valve body flange <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 14</cross-reference>, and the like, the plane of the external surface of the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> coincides with the plane of the opening of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. This structural arrangement assures the presence of the elastomer layer <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> inside the ink delivery hole with which the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is provided, rendering the valve mechanism into a highly reliable one which allows no possibility of the aforementioned seal leakage. Further, since the first valve body flange <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> has been moved away from the plane of the opening of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the opening portion of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> protrudes from the surface of the first valve body flange <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is attached, the position of the ID member is guided by the opening portion of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, making it easier to accurately position the ID member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> Each ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is installed into the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and supplies the correspondent negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with ink through the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and the valve mechanism of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> holding the ink storing containers <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> as described above is mounted on the carriage of a serial scanning type recording apparatus (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>) and is moved back and forth in the direction parallel to the plane of recording paper. In this case, it is desired from the viewpoint of product reliability that countermeasures are taken to prevent the state of the sealing between the interior surface of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and the exterior surface of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> of the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, from deteriorating due to the twisting which is caused at the joint by the run out of the axis of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, the shifting of the ink storing containers <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and the like, which occur as the carriage is moved back and forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in this embodiment, the thickness of the elastomer layer <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> in the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the valve mechanism shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, 14</cross-reference>, and the like, is made greater than the minimum requirement for sealing between the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, so that the run out of the shaft and the twisting, which occur at the location of the joint pipe connection during the reciprocal movement of the carriage, can be neutralized by the elasticity of the elastomer layer, to ensure a high level of reliability in terms of sealing performance. As for other measures, the rigidity of the valve body into which the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is inserted may be rendered greater than the rigidity of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, so that the deformation of the valve body, which is caused by the run out of the shaft and the twisting, which occur at the location of the joint pipe connection during the reciprocal movement of the carriage, can be controlled, to ensure a high level of reliability in terms of sealing performance. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> It is desired from the viewpoint of molding accuracy that the thickness u<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the elastomer layer <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> on the inside surface of the first valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the oblong cross section is even; the thickness at the curved portion and the thickness at the straight portion are the same. In terms of the vertical direction of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the depth of the sealing bite between the elastomer layer <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight> and the largest diameter portion (portion comprising the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is: g<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&minus;g<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;0.3 mm, and this amount is absorbed by the elastomer layer <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>. The total thickness of the elastomer layer <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>, which is involved in the absorption is: 0.8 mm&times;2&equals;1.6 mm. However, since the depth of the bite is 0.3 mm, it does not require as much force as otherwise necessary, to deform the elastomer layer <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>. Also in terms of the horizontal direction of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the depth of the bite for sealing is set at 0.3 mm, and the elastomer layer <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>, the total thickness of which for the absorption is: 0.8 mm&times;2&equals;1.6 mm, is made to absorb this amount. The exterior diameter g<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> in the vertical direction is smaller than the internal diameter g<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the elastomer layer <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>: g<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&lt;g<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and this relationship also applies to the horizontal direction: g<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&lt;g<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in the state illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>, it is assured that the elastomer layer comes into contact with only the sealing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, allowing the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> to be smoothly inserted, to perfectly seal the joint.

<heading lvl="1">Effects of Valve Mechanism Position </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> In the case of the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment, the valve cover <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> and second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the valve mechanism attached to the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> protrude deeper into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. With this arrangement, even if the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> becomes separated from the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, across the portion adjacent to the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> due to the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> caused by the consumption of the ink in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, adjacent to the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, is regulated by the portion of the valve mechanism, which has been deeply inserted into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, that is, the valve cover <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> and second valve body <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>In other words, even if the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> deforms as the ink is consumed, the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, immediately adjacent to the valve mechanism and in the area surrounding the immediate adjacencies of the valve mechanism, is regulated by the valve mechanism, and therefore, the ink path in the adjacencies of the valve mechanism, in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and the bubble path for allowing bubbles to rise during gas-liquid exchange, are ensured. Therefore, during the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, ink is not prevented from being supplied from the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> into the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and the bubbles are not prevented from rising in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> In the case of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comprising the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> deformable as described above, or the ink jet head cartridge equipped with the negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, it is desired from the viewpoint of increasing the buffering space in the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that balance is maintained between the negative pressure in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the negative pressure in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> so that the gas-liquid exchange occurs between the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and negative pressure controlling chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> after the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is deformed to the maximum extent. For the sake of high speed ink delivery, the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be enlarged. Obviously, it is desired that there is a large space in the region adjacent to the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and that ample ink supply path is secured in this region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> If the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is increased to secure the buffering space in the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> which contains the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, normally, the space adjacent to the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> narrows as the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> deforms. If the space adjacent to the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> narrows, the bubbles are prevented from rising in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and the ink supply path adjacent to the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is shrunk, raising the possibility that they will fail to compensate for the high speed ink delivery. Therefore, in the case that the valve mechanism does not protrude deeply into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, adjacent to the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, is not regulated, unlike the ink jet head cartridge in this embodiment, the amount of the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> must be kept within a range in which the deformation does not substantially affect the ink delivery, so that balance is maintained between the negative pressure in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the negative pressure in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, to compensate for the high speed ink delivery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> Comparatively, in this embodiment, the valve mechanism protrudes deeply into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> as described above, and the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, adjacent to the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, is regulated by the valve mechanism. Therefore, even if the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is increased, the region adjacent to the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, that is, the region through which the ink supply path leads to the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, is secured by sufficient size, making it possible to accomplish both objects: securing a large buffering space in the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and securing an ink delivery path capable of accommodating high speed ink delivery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> Below the bottom portion of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of the above described ink jet head cartridge, an electrode <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> used as an ink remainder amount detecting means for detecting the amount of the ink remaining in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, as will be described later, is positioned. The electrode <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is fixed to the carriage of a printer into which the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is installed. The joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to which the valve mechanism is attached is located in the bottom portion of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, adjacent to the front wall, that is, the wall on the negative pressure controlling chamber unit side. The valve mechanism is inserted deep into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in the direction approximately parallel to the bottom surface of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and therefore, when the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> deforms, the deformation of the bottom portion of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is regulated by the deeply inserted portion of the valve mechanism. In addition, the deformation of the bottom portion of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> during the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is regulated also by the slanting of a part of the bottom portion of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> comprising the external shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Since the shifting of the bottom portion of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> relative to the electrode <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is regulated by the further regulation of the deformation of the bottom portion of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> by the valve mechanism, in addition to, the effect of the regulation of the deformation of the bottom portion of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> by the slanting of the bottom portion of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, it becomes possible to more accurately carry out the ink remainder amount detection. Therefore, the above described regulation of the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, adjacent to the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, by the valve mechanism makes it possible to obtain a liquid supplying system capable of more accurately detecting the ink remainder amount, in addition to accomplishing the two objectives of securing a large buffering space in the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> by increasing the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and supplying ink at a high rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the valve mechanism is inserted deeper into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> so that the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, adjacent to the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, is regulated as described above, but a member different from the valve mechanism may be inserted into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to regulate the deformation of the aforementioned portion of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Further, a piece of plate may be inserted into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> through the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> so that the piece of plate stretches along the bottom surface of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. With this arrangement, more accurate ink remainder amount detection can be carried out when the ink remainder amount in the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is detected with the use of the electrode <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> In addition, in this embodiment, in the valve mechanism attached to the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the structural components of the valve mechanism protrude far deeper into the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, beyond the opening <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>which is connected to the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to form an ink path.

More specifically, referring to the side, where the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is located, the front side, and the side opposite thereto, the rear side, in the adjacencies of the front portion in which the valve mechanism is disposed, the bottom wall is rendered parallel to the horizontal plane, whereas in the region therefrom to the rear end, the bottom wall is slanted upward toward the rear. In consideration of the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, which will be described later, it is desired that this angle at which the bottom wall of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is obtuse relative to the rear sidewall of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, it is set to be no less than <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> The electrode <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is given a shape which conforms to the shape of the bottom wall of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and is positioned in the area correspondent to the slanted portion of the bottom wall of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, in parallel to the slanted portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0256" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0256&rsqb;</number> Hereinafter, the detection of the ink remainder amount in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> by this ink remainder amount detecting means will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0257" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0257&rsqb;</number> The ink remainder amount detection is carried out by detecting the capacitance (electrostatic capacity) which changes in response to the size of the portion of the electrode <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> correspondent to where the body of the remaining ink is, while applying pulse voltage between the electrode <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> on the holder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> side and the electrode <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> in the common liquid chamber <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. For example, the presence or absence of ink in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> can be detected by applying between the electrodes <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>, such pulse voltage that has a peak value of 5V, a rectangular wave-form, and a pulse frequency of 1 kHz, and computing the time constant and gain of the circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> As the amount of the ink remaining in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> reduces due to ink consumption, the ink liquid surface descends toward the bottom wall of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. As the ink remainder amount further reduces, the ink liquid surface descends to a level correspondent to the slanted portion of the bottom wall of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, as the ink is further consumed (the distance between the electrode <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and the body of the ink remains approximately constant), the size of the portion of the electrode <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> correspondent to where the body of ink remains, gradually reduces, and therefore, capacitance begins to reduce. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0259" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0259&rsqb;</number> Eventually, the ink will disappear from the area which corresponds with the position of the electrode <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. Thus, the decrease of the gain, and the increase in electrical resistance caused by the ink, can be detected by computing the time constant by changing the pulse width of the applied pulse or changing the pulse frequency. With this, it is determined that the amount of the ink in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is extremely small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0260" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0260&rsqb;</number> The above is the general concept of the ink remainder amount detection. In reality, in this embodiment, the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> comprises the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and as the ink is consumed, the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> deforms inward, that is, in the direction to reduce its internal volume, while allowing gas-liquid exchange between the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and the introduction of air between the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> through the air vent <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, so that balance is maintained between the negative pressure in the negative pressure controlling chamber shell <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the negative pressure in the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0261" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0261&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, during this deformation, the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> deforms while being controlled by the corner portions of the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The amount of the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and resultant partial or complete separation of the walls of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> from the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, are the largest at the two walls having the largest size (walls approximately parallel to the plane of the cross sectional in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), and is small at the bottom wall, or the wall adjacent to the above two walls. Nevertheless, with the increase in the deformation of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the distance between the body of the ink and the electrode <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, and the capacitance decreases in reverse proportion to the distance. However, in this embodiment, the main area of the electrode <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is in a plane approximately perpendicular to the deformational direction of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and therefore, even when the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> deforms, the electrode <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and the wall of the bottom portion of the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> remain approximately parallel to each other. As a result, the surface area directly related to the electrostatic capacity is secured in terms of size, assuring accuracy in detection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Further, as described before, in this embodiment, the ink storing container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is structured so that the angle of the corner portion between the bottom wall and the rear sidewall becomes no less than 95 degrees. Therefore, it is easier for the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to separate from the external shell <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> at this corner compared to the other corners. Thus, even when the internal bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> deforms toward the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, it is easier for the ink to be discharged toward the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> Hereinbefore, the structural aspects of this embodiment were individually described. These structures may be employed in optional combinations, and the combinations promise a possibility of enhancing the aforementioned effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> For example, combining the oblong structure of the joint portion with the above described valve structure stabilizes the sliding action during the installation or removal, assuring that the value is smoothly open or closed. Giving the joint portion the oblong cross section assures an increase in the rate at which ink is supplied. In this case, the location of the fulcrum shifts upward, but slanting the bottom wall of the ink container upward makes possible stable installation and removal, that is, the installation and removal during which the amount of twisting is small. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Recording Apparatus </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> Next, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, an example of an ink jet recording apparatus in which the above described ink container unit or ink jet head cartridge can be mounted will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> The recording apparatus shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> is provided with: a carriage <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> on which the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the ink jet head cartridge <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are removably installable; a head recovery unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> assembled from a head cap for preventing ink from losing liquid components through the plurality of orifices of the head and a suction pump for sucking out ink from the plurality of orifices as the head malfunctions; and a sheet feeding surface <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> by which recording paper as recording medium is conveyed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> The carriage <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> uses a position above the recovery unit <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> as its home position, and is scanned in the leftward direction as a belt <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is driven by a motor or the like. Printing is performed by ejecting ink from the head toward the recording paper conveyed onto the sheet feeding surface <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> As described above, the above structure in this embodiment is a structure not found among the conventional recording apparatuses. Not only do the aforementioned substructures of this structure individually contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency, but also contribute cooperatively, rendering the entirety of the structure organic. In other words, the above described substructures are excellent inventions, whether they are viewed individually or in combination; disclosed above are examples of the preferable structure in accordance with the present invention. Further, although the valve mechanism in accordance with the present invention is most suitable for the usage in the above described liquid container, the configuration of the liquid container does not need to be limited to the above described one; it can be also applied to liquid containers of different types in which liquid is directly stored in the liquid delivery opening portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, the description will be made as to a joint opening of the ink container unit and another valve mechanism provided in the joint opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a front view illustrating a relation between the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> and the second valve frame <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b; </italic></highlight><cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is a sectional view at the (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) is a front view showing a relation between the second valve frame <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the rotated valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) is a sectional view at the (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the opening configuration of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is an elongated hole extended in one direction to provide high supply performance of the ink of the ink accommodating container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> by expanding an opening area of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The opening configuration of the elongated hole of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> has a portion having a constant opening width. The configuration of the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> at the first valve frame <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>side corresponds to inner shape of the cross-section of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, that is, the elongated hole configuration of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. However, if the opening width of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> in the widthwise direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the space occupied by ink accommodating container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> increases with the result of bulkiness of the apparatus. This is particularly significant when ink containers are juxtaposed in the lateral direction (scanning direction of the carriage) in the case of color or photographic printing. In this embodiment, the configuration of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> which is an ink supply port of the ink accommodating container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is an elongated hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the ink jet head cartridge of the embodiment functions to supply the ink to the negative pressure control chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and to introduce the ambience into the ink accommodating container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Since the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is elongated in the direction of the gravity, the lower portion of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> mainly functions as an ink supply passage, and the upper portion of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> mainly functions as an ambience introduction path, so that function separation is easily accomplished by which assure ink supply and gas-liquid exchange can be accomplished. As described in the foregoing, the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> of the negative pressure control chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is inserted into the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> with the mounting of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Then, third valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is pushed by the valve opening and closing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>provided at a free end of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> to open third valve mechanism of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, by which the ink inner is supplied into the negative pressure control chamber unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from third inside of third ink accommodating container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. Depending on the orientation or position of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which is being mounted to the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, the valve opening and closing projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>might be obliquely abutted to the valve member. Even if this happens, the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is not clogged, since the cross-sectional configuration of the end of the seal projection <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>disposed at the side of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is semicircular. In order to accomplish stable sliding motion of the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> at this time, a clearance <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), is provided between a joint seal surface <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> inside of the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and outer periphery of the first valve frame <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>side portion of the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. Moreover, at the free end portion of the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, at least the upper portion is open, and therefore, when the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is inserted into the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the formation of the main ambience introduction path is not obstructed at the upper portion in the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and in the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, thus accomplishing smooth gas-liquid exchanging operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> When the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is dismounted, the joint pipe <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is separated from the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, by which the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> slides forward toward the first valve frame <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by the elastic force applied by the urging member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight>, until the taper portion <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> of the valve frame of the first valve frame <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) is engaged with the taper portion <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> of the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>, by which the ink supply passage is shut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> When the clearance <highlight><bold>266</bold></highlight> is provided to permit sliding motion, between the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> and the second valve frame <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, in such a valve mechanism, the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> might rotate in the second valve frame <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>about nothing as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) during the mounting-and-demounting operation of the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, in the urging force to the first valve frame <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>provided by the first valve frame <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is selected such that even if pressure difference is produced between the inside and outside of the ink accommodating container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> duty the ambient condition change, the urging force of the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is maintained substantially constant. When such an ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is used at a highland (the ambient pressure is 0.7 atm, for example), and then, the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is closed, and then the ink container unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is transported to ambience of 1.0 atm, the inside pressure of the ink accommodating container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is lower than the ambient pressure, so that force is produced in the direction of opening the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, similarly to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> The values are those when the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> and the first valve frame <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are engaged with each other. When the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> and the first valve frame <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are disengaged from each other, the displacement of the urging member <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> to produce the urging force to the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is large, so that urging force urging the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> toward the first valve frame <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is further large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> A maximum rotation angle is defined as a rotation angle of the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> when the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is contacted to the second valve frame <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as a result of the rotation of the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> about the shaft thereof. When the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is urged to the first valve frame <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the maximum rotation angle, the valve frame taper portion <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> and the valve member seal portion <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are contacted at two diametrically opposite conditions about the center of the axis of rotation. The valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> is urged toward the first valve frame <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>side by the urging force, and therefore, the valve member <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> produces a restoring force in the opposite rotational direction, and it stops with the valve frame taper portion <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> completely engaged with the seal portion <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the valve member. In the state of complete engagement between the taper portion <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> and the seal portion <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the valve member, they are engaged with each other in the engagement region <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, (<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>).

It is also desirable that large space exists in the region adjacent the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> in the inner bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, so that ink supply passage is sufficiently provided in the region. If the deformation of the inner bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is increased in an attempt to assure the buffer space in the casing <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> accommodating the inner bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the space adjacent the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> in the inner bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> because small with the deformation of the inner bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>.

In addition, since a part of the bottom portion of the ink accommodating container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> including the casing <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the inner bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is tapered, a corner portion is provided to regulate the deformation of the bottom portion of the inner bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> during the deformation of the inner bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In addition to the advantageous effects of the regulation of the deformation of the bottom portion of the inner bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> by the inclination of the bottom portion of the ink accommodating container <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, the deformation of the bottom portion of the inner bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is related by the valve mechanism, so that movement of the bottom portion of the inner bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> relative to the electrode <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is regulated, and therefore, correct detection of the ink remaining amount is accomplished even when the deformation of the inner bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is large in order to assure the buffer space. Therefore, the deformation of the portion of the inner bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> adjacent the joint opening <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> by the valve mechanism, as described hereinbefore, there is provided a liquid supplying system in which the assuring of the large buffer space in the casing <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> by using large deformation of the inner bladder <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the high speed ink supply are both satisfied together with the advantage of correct detection of the ink remaining amount. </paragraph>

The valve mechanism comprises a first valve frame <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>disposed a a supply port portion of the ink container, a second valve frame <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>including an upper valve frame opening <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and a lower valve frame opening <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and cooperative with t first valve frame <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to constitute a valve frame in t ink container, a valve cap <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> for covering a rear end opening of the second valve frame <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, valve member <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, an urging member <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> for urging the valve member <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> to the first valve frame <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> The first valve frame <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>includes a frame and an elastomer <highlight><bold>567</bold></highlight> therein, and it is desirable that length A of the entirety including the elastomer <highlight><bold>567</bold></highlight> is in a proper range. When the ink container is dismounted from t recording head, the ink may remain in the first valve frame <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. If the first valve frame <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is too long, the amount of the remaining ink is excessive with the result of a large amount of the ink leakage (drain). If it is too short, the regulation of the connecting operation with the recording head and the assuring of the connection state may be not easy. In this embodiment, A is approx. 5.3 mm. By selecting a proper range for the length of the first valve frame <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the amount of the ink leakage can be limited to an extent of practically acceptable, and the connection state can be easily maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> The contact portion between the elastomer <highlight><bold>567</bold></highlight> of the first valve frame <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the valve member <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is in the form of a lip portion <highlight><bold>567</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extending all around to prevent the leakage of the ink. The lip portion <highlight><bold>567</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>deforms (tilts) inwardly or outwardly when it is contacted to the valve member <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>. If the orientation of the tilting is not uniform, that is, the lip tilts inwardly in a portion and outwardly in the other portion, the sealing property at the boundary portion is not assured with the result of ink leakage. In this embodiment, the lip portion <highlight><bold>567</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is slightly tilted outwardly. By doing so, the it is assured that lip portion <highlight><bold>567</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is entirely tilted outwardly upon contact to the valve member <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> (open), so that high sealing performance is assured. It is a possible alternative to make the lip tilt inwardly, but in that case, the lip portion has to deform in such a direction that circumferential length thereof is reduced with the possible result of wrinkle which may lead to ink leakage. When this can be avoided, the inward tilting structure is usable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0324" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0324&rsqb;</number> The first valve frame <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is provided with a first valve frame flange portion <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> to be connected with the casing of the ink container. The outer diameter of the flange portion <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> is 16 mm in this embodiment. This is selected in order to provide a space for preventing the ink from going around the connecting portion between the casing and the flange portion <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0325" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0325&rsqb;</number> The elastomer <highlight><bold>567</bold></highlight> of the first valve frame <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a portion of a different thickness. The frame is disposed at the thickness changing portion. The elastomer <highlight><bold>567</bold></highlight> receives a load to be deformed by connection with joint pipe. By the deformation of elastomer, the joint pipe receives the reaction force so that force required for the connection becomes large correspondingly. For the purpose of reducing the force required for the mounting, the thickness of the elastomer <highlight><bold>567</bold></highlight> is made different. By the portion having the different thickness, the force required for the mounting can be reduced. The free end portion of the elastomer <highlight><bold>567</bold></highlight> is slightly projected upward beyond the flange portion <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> of the first frame, and the end has an acute angle. By the projected structure beyond the flange portion, there is provided a space with which the ink is prevented from going around the connecting portion between casing and the flange portion <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0326" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0326&rsqb;</number> A projected portion <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is provided at each side of the connection between the flange portion <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> of the first frame and the casing. The projected portion <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>functions to protect the welded portion <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>provided at each side of the connection between the firstframe flange portion <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and the casing. The projected portion <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is effective to prevent damage of the parts (the first frame flange portion <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>) during transportation before the firstframe flange portion <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> is assembled into the casing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0327" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0327&rsqb;</number> The description will be made as to the structure of valve member <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>.

The sliding shaft <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is extended out from the valve end more than the sliding shaft of the valve mechanism shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, for example. By doing so, it can be utilized as a guide for assembling the urging member (valve spring) <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> and the valve cap <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> into the valve member, so that move assembling property of the valve mechanism can be improved. In this embodiment, it is 17.3 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0328" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0328&rsqb;</number> The diameter of the sliding shaft is larger than that in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. By doing so, the clearance among the valve member <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, the valve cap and the urging member <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> can be reduced.

<paragraph id="P-0334" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0334&rsqb;</number> The load and the inclination of the spring constant of the urging member <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> are determined in consideration of assuring the sealing property of the valve member <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> and reducing the change of the mounting force in the mounting process of mounting the ink container. In addition, as to the material constituting the structure, it is desirably selected in consideration of the liquid contact property relative to the ink, and the surface treatment thereof is made in consideration of the elusion thereof into the ink. For example, when a Ni coating is used, the Ni elusion may occur into the ink, and therefore, the treatment is not desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0335" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0335&rsqb;</number> In addition, the upper valve frame opening <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the lower a valve frame opening <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>provided between the first valve frame <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the second valve frame <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, have the same the opening areas in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>, but this is not limiting, and they may have different areas. However, the opening areas of the upper valve frame opening <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the lower valve frame opening <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>desirably satisfy the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0336" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0336&rsqb;</number> Area of the upper valve frame opening <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>&lt;lower valve frame opening <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0337" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0337&rsqb;</number> The upper valve frame opening <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is used mainly for movement of the air in the gas-liquid exchange. (However, it contributes to the movement of the ink when the air does not move.) The lower valve frame opening <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>side is used for the movement of ink in the gas-liquid exchange. Therefore, by making the area of the lower valve frame opening <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>larger, the amount of ink supply can be enough for a high speed printing. The upper valve frame opening <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>has enough opening area to prevent stagnation and/or deposition of the bubble with respect to the movement of the gas. The upper valve frame opening <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the lower valve frame opening <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>have inner opening areas not to produce unnecessarily large resistance against passes of the gas and the liquid (ink). As described in the foregoing, according to the present invention, the opening configuration of the ink supply port is elongated in one direction the valve mechanism using a valve member slidably supported, and therefore, the rotational angle of the valve member is regulated when the valve member slides, associate the sealing property of the valve mechanism when it is closed, and in addition, the opening area of the ink supply port can be assured due to sufficient even in the case that width of the ink container cannot be large because of the spaces allotted thereto is limited, and the ink supply port is formed in the widthwise side. Therefore, a large flow rate of ink is permitted with high sealing property of the valve mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0338" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0338&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the thickness of the elastomer is larger than the thickness required to simply seal the gap between the frame and then said pipe, so that sealing property is assured between the elastomer on the inner surface of the frame and the outer surface of the pipe, and simultaneously, the relative positional deviation hitting said pipe and the liquid container can be suppressed by the elastomer, so that highly reliable seal is accomplished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the rigidity of the frame intimate the pipe is inserted, is high than the rigidity of the pipe, by which the elastic force of the elastomer against the outer surface of the pipe is maintained even if the frame is deformed, and therefore, a highly reliable sealing property can be assured between the elastomer on the inner surface of the frame and the outer surface of the pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0340" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0340&rsqb;</number> Additionally, when such a valve mechanism is used for the liquid supply port of a liquid container, an assured sealing and a stabilized ink supply can be simultaneously accomplished irrespective of relative positional deviation between the joint pipe of the liquid receiving side and the liquid container which are connected with each other. Additionally, the valve member is provided with a taper providing smaller diameter toward the cap member, and therefore, the angle of clogging of the valve member in the frame can be made smaller the case without the tapered so that adhesiveness between the free end of the valve member and the contact member can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0341" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0341&rsqb;</number> In addition, by providing the cap member with the guide portion engaging with one end of the frame, the positional deviation of the cap member is reduced when one end of the valve frame and the cap member are welded with each other by an ultrasonic welding, which generates vibration. Therefore, the accuracy of position of the center of the hole of the cap member can be improved. Even if a force is imparted to the cap member through the shaft portion of the valve member due to the clogging of the valve member, the proper connection state can be assured between the cap member and the like by the function of guide portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0342" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0342&rsqb;</number> By the provision of rounded part of edge line of the hole of the cap member in the side opposite from the connecting side with the frame of the cap member, the resistance resulting from the contact between the cap member and the shaft portion of the valve member can be reduced when the valve member is sliding toward the contact member with the clogging. Moreover, the contact portion between the contact member and the free end of the valve member is in the form of a flat plane, and therefore, even if the valve member is contacted thereto with the clogging, the contact radius relative to the contact member of the rounded part of the valve member is constant, and therefore, the contact is complete. In addition, the portion of elastomer contacting to the valve member is in the form of a tongue-like projection, and therefore, the close contact is assured. When such a valve mechanism is used in a supply port of an ink accommodating container, the clogging of the valve member with the part for reacting against the valve member can be suppressed when the ink accommodating container is connected with or disconnected from the ink receiving portion or when the connecting and disconnected actions are repeated, and therefore, the assured sealing is accomplished. By providing the liquid containing portion with the regulating member for regulated the deformation of the portion adjacent the supply port in the liquid containing portion, the establishment of the liquid flow path adjacent the supply port in the liquid containing portion and the establishment of passage for the bubble to be introduced into the liquid containing portion, are assured, so that flowability of the liquid in the liquid containing portion is not decreased even by the narrowing of the portion adjacent the supply port in the liquid containing portion, so that high speed liquid supply is always assured. When such a liquid supply container is used with a combination of an accommodating container for accommodating a capillary force generating member, which can retain the liquid supplied from a liquid supply container, the buffer space in the inner due to large deformation of the liquid containing portion and the high speed liquid supply can both be assured. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0344" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0344&rsqb;</number> Additionally, by further regulating the bottom surface portion of the liquid containing portion in the state of use by the regulating member, the following advantage is provided; when the liquid containing portion and therefore inner bladder are made larger for the purpose of assuring the buffer space, and the presence or absence of the liquid in the liquid containing portion, for example, the possible erroneous detection attributable to the increase of the deformation of the bottom surface portion of the liquid containing portion resulting from a large deformation of the inner bladder, so that correct detection of the liquid remaining amount is accomplished. </paragraph>
