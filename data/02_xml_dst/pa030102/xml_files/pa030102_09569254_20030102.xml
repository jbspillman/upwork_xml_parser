<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In a driving apparatus for a vibration type motor which obtains a driving force by applying a periodic signal to an electromechanical energy conversion element portion, when the driven amount of the vibration type motor is small, the vibration type motor is driven by a high voltage in a frequency range with a high lower limit as compared with a case wherein the driven amount is not small. This makes it possible to realize high-speed focusing and suppress electric power consumption low. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an optical apparatus and vibration type motor driving control method and, more particularly, to an optical apparatus made up of a lens incorporating a vibration type motor for focus adjustment and an apparatus body in which the lens is mounted and which supplies power to the vibration type motor and provides focus detection information, and a vibration type motor driving control method applied to the optical apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The above optical apparatus is, for example, a single-lens reflex camera having a vibration type motor incorporated in an exchangeable lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Of conventional cameras using silver halide films, a single-lens reflex camera, in particular, is capable of exchanging lenses. As such exchangeable lenses, lenses with various focal lengths have been manufactured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As such an exchangeable lens, an automatic focus control lens is available, which can automatically adjust the focus by driving the focus lens using a built-in motor. This motor is driven on the basis of focus detection information generated by the camera body. As this motor, a DC motor has been used. Recently, however, a vibration type motor has been widely used in place of the DC motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This vibration type motor can maintain high torque up to the range of small numbers of rotations, and hence requires no reduction gear. This motor has many advantages. For example, a reduction in size can be attained, and noise can be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the vibration type motor, a driving voltage generated on the basis of a plurality of periodic signals having different phases is applied to a built-in electromechanical energy conversion element to generate travelling waves, thereby rotating a rotating member. The vibration type motor is accelerated by sweeping the frequency (driving frequency) of a periodic signal from a frequency higher than the resonant frequency of the motor to the resonant frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Recently, in a super-telephoto lens having a focal length of 300 mm or more, in particular, a strong demand has arisen for an increase in the driving speed of a focus adjustment motor. This is because such a super-telephoto lens is often used to shoot sports activity such as track-and-field events, and focus control that can faithfully follow quick movements of athletes is strongly demanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For drive the vibration type motor at high speed, there may be a method in which the sweeping speed of the driving frequency is simply increased. In this method, however, the characteristics of the vibration type motor cannot follow the sweeping speed of the driving frequency, resulting in awkward movements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As another method, the driving voltage applied to the vibration type motor is raised. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> are graphs respectively showing the electric power consumption (P) of the vibration type motor and the number of rotations (N) when the driving voltage applied to the vibration type motor is doubled, with the ordinate representing a driving frequency f. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, curves Nx and Px respectively represent the number of rotations and electric power consumption at a general driving voltage value, whereas curves Ny and Py respectively represent the number of rotations and electric power consumption at a voltage twice as high as the general driving voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As is obvious from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> showing the numbers of rotations, when the driving voltage is doubled, the number of rotation almost doubles at the same driving frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As is obvious from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, however, when the driving voltage is doubled, the power consumption of the vibration type motor almost doubles as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In a single-lens reflex camera, since power is supplied from a battery in the camera body to the exchangeable lens (no battery is installed in the exchangeable lens), the power that can be used by the exchangeable lens itself is limited accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, when the driving voltage to the vibration type motor is raised, and the driving frequency is decreased to f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to increase the number of rotations of the vibration type motor to N<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the power consumption increases to P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. As a result, the voltage of the battery on the camera body side drops. This may cause operation errors in various actuators on the camera body side, resulting in an operation error in the camera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As described above, if the driving voltage to the vibration type motor is simply raised to increase the number of rotations so as to drive the vibration type motor at high speed, a serious problem arises in the camera system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> (First Embodiment) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a circuit diagram showing the arrangement of a control circuit arranged in a camera body and exchangeable lens according to the first embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, this arrangement includes a power supply battery <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> housed in the camera body, a microcomputer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on the camera body side, a switch <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that is turned on when the shutter button (two-stroke button) is pressed to the first-stroke position, and a transistor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for power supply which is controlled by the microcomputer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> controls the overall circuit on the exchangeable lens side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The camera body has terminals a to f. The terminal a is the positive terminal of the battery <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; the terminal b, a power supply terminal; the terminal c, a terminal for transferring data from the microcomputer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the camera body to the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the exchangeable lens; the terminal d, a terminal for transferring data from the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the exchangeable lens to the microcomputer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the camera body; the terminal e, a terminal for transferring a sync clock for data transfer; and the terminal f, the negative terminal of the battery <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Terminals a&prime; to f&prime; are those on the exchangeable lens side which correspond to the terminals a to f. When the exchangeable lens is mounted in the camera body, the corresponding terminals are connected to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A control circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> controls a DC/DC converter. The control circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is controlled by I/O data from the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The DC/DC converter is a boosting circuit and comprised of a coil <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, switching FET <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, feedback resistor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, diode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for preventing current backflow, rectifying capacitor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and voltage-dividing resistors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The gate of the FET <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is controlled by the control circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The node between the FET <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the feedback resistor <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is connected to the control circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to constitute a so-called current feedback type DC/DC converter. The diode <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> serves as a diode for preventing the backflow of a current from the rectifying capacitor <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the battery <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An output voltage Vout from the DC/DC converter is sent to a driving circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (to be described later) and divided by the voltage-dividing resistors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be fed back from the node (point x) between the voltage-dividing resistors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or the node (point y) between the voltage-dividing resistors <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the control circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The control circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> selects the voltage at the point x or the voltage at the point y in accordance with a command from the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and controls the output voltage Vout from the DC/DC converter in accordance with the selected voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A D/A converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> converts digital data output from the output port of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and indicating a driving frequency into an analog voltage. A VCO (voltage/frequency converter) <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is connected to this D/A converter and generates a rectangular wave having a frequency corresponding to the input analog voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The driving circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> drives the vibration type motor and uses the output voltage Vout from the DC/DC converter as power. The output terminal of the VCO <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the output port of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are connected to the driving circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is driven by driving voltages having phases A and B with a phase difference of 90&deg;, transmitted from the driving circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> outputs an S-phase signal indicating its own driven state. This S-phase signal is input to the input port of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> through a phase determining circuit <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The exchangeable lens is driven by the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Since the driving mechanism of the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is known well, a description thereof will be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A pulse plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> rotates with rotation of the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The rotational motion of the pulse plate <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is detected by a photo interrupter <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The detection output from the photo interrupter <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is input to the input port of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the lens side through a wave forming circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The operation of the control circuit having the above arrangement will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing the operation of the control circuit. This operation will be described in the order of step numbers (S). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>01</bold></highlight>: When the shutter button of the camera body is pressed to the first-stoke position, the switch <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is turned on. As a consequence, a focus detection circuit (not shown) on the camera body side starts its operation. In addition, when the switch <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is turned on, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> on the camera body side turns on the power supply transistor <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to start the supply of electric power to the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and control circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the terminals b and b&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>02</bold></highlight>: The defocus information of the photographing lens which is obtained by the focus detecting operation by the focus detection circuit is transferred from the microcomputer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the camera body to the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the lens side through the terminals c and c&prime;. The defocus information indicates the degree of defocus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>03</bold></highlight>: The microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> calculates the driven amount of the exchangeable lens on the basis of this defocus information, and then determines on the basis of the calculated driven amount whether the necessary driven amount is small. If it is determined that the necessary driven amount is small, the flow advances to step S<highlight><bold>04</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the flow advances to step S<highlight><bold>07</bold></highlight>. Note that a small driven amount is an amount smaller than the predetermined driven amount of the exchangeable lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>04</bold></highlight>: If it is determined that the necessary driven amount is small, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> causes the control circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the DC/DC converter to select the divided voltage at the point y as a feedback voltage. As a consequence, the driving voltage of the vibration type motor is set to a high voltage. This operation will be described in detail later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>05</bold></highlight>: The microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the lens side sets digital data indicating the driving frequency of the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to a large value first, and sends it to the D/A converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> then gradually decreases the value of the digital data. Since the input analog voltage of the VCO <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> gradually drops from a high value, the frequency (driving frequency) f of the rectangular wave output from the VCO <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is swept from a high frequency to a lower frequency. The driving circuit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the vibration type motor generates driving voltages having the phases A and B with a phase difference of 90&deg; on the basis of this rectangular wave. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, therefore, the number of rotations of the vibration type motor gradually increases with a decrease in driving frequency. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the vibration type motor is abbreviated as USM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>06</bold></highlight>: The microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> keeps decreasing the digital data while the driving frequency f is higher than a predetermined frequency f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). If the driving frequency f becomes equal to or lower than the predetermined frequency f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the flow advances to step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>07</bold></highlight>: If the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> determined in step S<highlight><bold>03</bold></highlight> that the driven amount of the exchangeable lens is not small, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> causes the control circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the DC/DC converter to select the divided voltage at the point x as a feedback voltage. As a consequence, the driving voltage of the vibration type motor is set to a low voltage. This operation will be described in detail later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>08</bold></highlight>: The vibration type motor is accelerated as in step S<highlight><bold>05</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>09</bold></highlight>: If the driving frequency f is higher than a predetermined frequency f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&lt;f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> keeps decreasing the digital data. If the driving frequency f becomes equal to or lower than the predetermined frequency f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the flow advances to step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>: The microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the lens side fixes the digital data, which is to be output to the D/A converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, to the current value, and stops sweeping the driving frequency, thereby holding the rotational speed of the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> at a constant speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>: A pulse signal generated in accordance with the rotation of the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is input from the wave forming circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to the input port of the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The number of input pulse signals is counted by the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> holds the rotational speed of the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> at the constant speed until the count value reaches a first predetermined value. When the count value reaches the first predetermined value , the flow advances to step S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>: Upon determining that the exchangeable lens has moved near to a target driving position, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> starts decelerating the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. That is, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> gradually increases the driving frequency indicated by digital data sent to the D/A converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. With this operation, the input analog voltage to the VCO <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> rises. As a consequence, the frequency of the rectangular wave output from the VCO <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is swept to a high frequency, and the frequency of the driving voltage applied to the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is also swept to a high frequency. Consequently, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the number of rotations of the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> decreases, and the motor is decelerated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>: The microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> keeps decelerating the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> until the number of pulses counted by the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> reaches a second predetermined value (second predetermined value&gt;first predetermined value). When the number of pulses reaches the second predetermined value, the flow advances to step S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>: Upon determining that the exchangeable lens has reached the target driving position, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> stops driving the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> abruptly increases the driving frequency indicated by the digital data sent to the D/A converter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to abruptly change the frequency of the driving voltage applied to the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to a high frequency at which the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> stops. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Assume that the voltage-dividing resistors <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> respectively have resistances R<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, R<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and R<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Letting Vr (not shown) be a reference voltage value in the control circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the DC/DC converter, if the divided voltage at the point x is selected as a feedback voltage by the control circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the output voltage Vout from the DC/DC converter is given by </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Vout</italic></highlight>&equals;Vr&times;(R<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&plus;R<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&plus;R<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>)/(R<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&plus;R<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> If the divided voltage at the point y is selected as a feedback voltage, the output voltage Vout from the DC/DC converter is given by </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Vout</italic></highlight>&equals;Vr&times;(R<highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&plus;R<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&plus;R<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>)/R<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As described above, when the voltage at the point y is selected as a feedback voltage, the output voltage Vout becomes higher and hence the driving voltage to the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> becomes higher than when the voltage at the point x is selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> If R<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>&equals;R<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the driving voltage obtained by selecting the voltage at the point y is twice that obtained by selecting the voltage at the point x. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As is obvious from steps S<highlight><bold>03</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>04</bold></highlight>, since the voltage at the point y is selected when the necessary driven amount of the exchangeable lens is small, a high driving voltage is set, and a curve Ny shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> is used. When the necessary driven amount of the exchangeable lens is small, therefore, the large number of rotations is obtained. In addition, when the necessary driven amount of the exchangeable lens is not small, the obtained number of rotation is small and, therefore, the electric power consumption of the exchangeable lens is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> When the necessary driven amount of the exchangeable lens is small, since the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is driven for a short period of time without increasing the number of rotations much, the frequency of the driving voltage is kept high. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, therefore, as the motor is driven while the driving frequency is not decreased below, for example, f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the electric power consumption of the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> does not increase beyond P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> even if the driving voltage is doubled. However, since the driving voltage is doubled, the number of rotations reaches N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. This number of rotation is almost equal to that when the driving frequency of a general driving voltage is decreased to f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The electric power consumption of the motor does not exceed P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> regardless of whether the necessary driven amount of the exchangeable lens is small or not. This eliminates the chance that excessive electric power consumption will cause operation errors in other devices in a camera system as in the prior art. In addition, when the necessary driven amount of the exchangeable lens is small, high-speed driving operation can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In a scene which requires high motion tracking performance as in continuously shooting of some sports activity, the exchangeable lens is often driven in small amounts. The capability of increasing the focusing speed in driving the exchangeable lens in small amounts will provide great effect in terms of motion tracking performance. The feature of raising the driving voltage of the vibration type motor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> only when the exchangeable lens is driven in small amounts as in the present invention makes it possible to improve the reliability of the camera system without affecting the overall camera system. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The second embodiment will be described next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Since the arrangement of the second embodiment is basically the same as that of the first embodiment, only different portions will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the arrangement of a control circuit arranged in an exchangeable lens according to the second embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> mainly shows portions that differ from the control circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The same reference numerals as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> denote the same parts in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and an illustration of the components denoted by reference numerals <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the components of the camera body is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The second embodiment differs from the first embodiment in a portion for switching driving voltage values for the vibration type motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Two reference voltages Vr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and Vr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (Vr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&gt;Vr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are input to a control circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of a DC/DC converter. An output voltage Vout from the DC/DC converter is divided by resistors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> to be fed back to the control circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Assume that the resistors <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> respectively have resistances R<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> As in the first embodiment, the control circuit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> selects the reference voltage Vr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or Vr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in accordance with the driven amount of the exchangeable lens which is calculated by a microcomputer <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> on the lens side. More specifically, if the necessary driven amount of the exchangeable lens is smaller than a predetermined value, the reference voltage Vr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is selected. In this case, the output voltage Vout from the DC/DC converter is given by </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Vout</italic></highlight>&equals;Vr<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&times;(R<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&plus;R<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>)/R<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> If the necessary driven amount of the exchangeable lens is equal to or larger than the predetermined value, the reference voltage Vr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is selected. In this case, the output voltage Vout from the DC/DC converter is given by </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>Vout</italic></highlight>&equals;Vr<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&times;(R<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&plus;R<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>)/R<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> This output voltage Vout is lower than that set when the necessary driven amount of the exchangeable lens is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Other operations of the control circuit are the same as those in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In this manner, in the second embodiment as well, high-speed focusing operation can be realized, and electric power consumption can be suppressed low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The present invention can be applied to a system made up of a plurality of devices or an apparatus including one device. </paragraph>
