<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to binding and more particularly to a device and method for binding a collated product using a side wire stitcher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To form books (defined herein to include all sheet and signature assemblages), sheets or signatures typically are collated or assembled so that the sheets of the book are arranged in the desired order. The books are then bound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Traditional binding methods include saddleback stitching and perfect binding. With saddleback stitching, the sheets of the book typically are conveyed so that a fold in the sheets is presented to a stitching device, with the sheets hanging downward in a saddle-like fashion. U.S. Pat. No. 3,317,026 to Zugel et al., for example, discloses a saddleback stitching device with two saddle stitchers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Saddleback stitching devices have the disadvantage that the spine of the book is not flat. For high-quality binding or larger books, this type of binding can be undesirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Perfect binders prepare a book for gluing or adhesion by registering the sheets or signatures of the book so that the sheets or signatures of the book present themselves along a spine of the book. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,697,971 and 5,788,446 for example purport to disclose perfect binders. A book cover typically will be bound with glue at a separate cover station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Perfect binders have the disadvantage that the glued spine can degrade after repeated use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To improve on perfect binders and to provide for longer lasting binding in addition to the other advantages of perfect binding, it has been known to side wire stitch the signatures or sheets using stand alone stitching machines. National Geographic magazine, for example, traditionally has been side wire stitched. With side wire stitching, books typically are registered and clamped as with perfect binders, and then stitched from the side. These stitching units however require a special connection area prior to a covering machine, and the books thus must be transferred from the stitching machines to a separate cover machine, which can lead to malfunctions. The stitching machines also take up significant floor space, and are slow in operation. As a result, the books are often split into two streams, adding to the space requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the side wire stitching typically was performed in a collator raceway, with a loose collated book placed in a clamp to hold the set together for stitch application and then fully released by the clamp. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> An object of the present invention is to provide a method and device for improved side wire stitching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a side wire stitching binder comprising at least one side wire stitcher for stitching a book through a side of the book, a cover station for applying a cover over a spine of the book, and a clamping device including a clamp for clamping the book in the at least one side wire stitcher and for transferring the book from the at least one side wire stitcher to the cover station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> By connecting the side wire stitcher and the cover station directly with a single clamp, the book may be tightly held in the clamp with higher clamp pressures and better registration. In addition, a transfer of the book between the side wire stitcher and the cover station can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The binder may further include a first level shelf along which the spine may be registered and then firmly gripped by the clamp. A section of the book remains exposed below the clamp, so that side stitches may be applied to the exposed section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The at least one side wire stitcher preferably includes two stitchers, so that every other book can be stitched by one of the stitchers, thus improving throughput of the binder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The binder may also further include a backbone preparation device after the stitching devices for roughening the spine to improve cover application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The cover station preferably includes a cover feeder, an applier drum and a cover breaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The binder also may include a second level shelf after the stitchers so as to reduce the amount of exposure of the books in the clamps. For example, the first level shelf may be placed with respect to the clamps such that &frac12; to one inch of the books is exposed below the clamping surface. After stitching, the second level shelf may be placed with respect to the clamps such that one quarter to &frac12; of one inch of the book remains exposed. This lesser exposure can aid in backbone preparation and cover application by providing a firmer grip closer to the spine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a method for binding a book comprising the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> clamping the book with a first clamp; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> side stitching the book while clamped in the first clamp; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> transporting the book to a cover station using the first clamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> By having the clamp perform both the side stitching support function and the transport to the cover station function, the quality of the binding can be improved.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a schematized top view of a binder <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. An infeed <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can feed incoming collated books in a spine down position onto a conveyor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A plurality of clamps travel in an endless loop <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. At a section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of loop <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the clamps are in an open position, with one side of the clamp being in a vertical position, and the other side being raised. In a transfer area <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, books <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are transferred from conveyor <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> against a first side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of clamp <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in front of a stop <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Stop <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is shown as a vertical bar, but may also be a register pin with a flat side, so that the pin is shaped like a backwards D letter. First side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> remains in a vertical position and is generally fixed with respect to a carriage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a support <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> traveling on loop or track <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Alternately, a track directly at the back of first side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> could be provided. Second side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is pivotable about a pivot <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> with respect to first side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and may be spring loaded to close against first side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A cam <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> attached to second side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can follow a cam follower to force the second side to open, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Once book <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> contacts first side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the cam <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> can release from a cam follow so that side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is forced into closed position by spring-action (and which may be maintained by the spring action). Book <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> thus is in a vertical position, and may enter a first level shelf station <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Preferably, side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can lock over center so that both the open and closed positions can be maintained without cam contact, but a cam can move the side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> between the two positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> (which for clarity purposes does not show cam <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>), in level shelf section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a spine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on book <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> runs along a level shelf <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Second side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be slightly released from first side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, for example by virtue of cam action, so that book <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> registers against the level shelf <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and rear stop <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which is thicker than the thickness of book <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Proper register of book <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may thus be created, and a distance d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can result between the edge of clamp sides <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the level shelf <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This distance d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> preferably is between &frac12; and one inch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Book <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> clamped in clamp <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> then enters a first side stitcher <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with a pair of stitching heads <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a wire feed <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. First side stitcher <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can place two wire stitches through the side of book <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. A clincher <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be placed opposite the stitching heads <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to support the back side of the book <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or clamp <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. An optional second side stitcher <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can have stitching heads <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, wire feed <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and clincher <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and can be used so that each stitcher <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> stitches every other book in alternating fashion, thereby increasing throughput. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, book <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> after exiting stitcher <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is bound by side stitches <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Spine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the book can then be prepared by a backbone preparation station <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), which can for example saw or roughen the spine to improve the spine surface for application of glue for the cover. An optional second backbone preparation station <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> can aid in increasing throughput of the binder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It may be desirable to have clamp <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> hold the book closer to the spine during backbone preparation. An optional second level shelf <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be provided after the stitchers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to reduce the distance d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Clamp <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be slightly released so that book <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> slides up along a slope <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> while clamp <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> remains in a constant vertical position. Slope <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> rises a distance d<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at a flat section <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. Distance d<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is less than d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, so that the book spine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> still protrudes a distance d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> subtracted by d<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> beyond the bottom of clamp <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Clamp <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> then can again grip book <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> firmly through backbone preparation station <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The distance d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-d<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> preferably is between one quarter and &frac12; of an inch. Alternately, the second level shelf <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may be flat and the vertical position of clamp <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may decrease by distance d<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As clamps <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> exit backbone preparation station <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, clamps <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> move around loop <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> toward a cover station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Covers move from a cover feeder <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in direction <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and arrive underneath the clamps <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on a conveyor belt. A cover adhesive can be delivered to the cover by an adhesive station <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and an applier drum <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can smooth the adhesive. At a cover breaker <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the cover is forced against the spine <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the book <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is released from clamp <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. If desired, the sides of the cover may be pressed partly against the cover as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The bound and covered books <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> then exit along a conveyor belt <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, while clamps <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> return along loop <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, where clamps <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are rotated about carriage <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so that side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is again ready to receive a new book <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The present device provides for improved side stitching and for transfer of a book between the stitchers and the cover station using a single clamp, which can improve stitch placement and cover placement. In place of cams, it is conceivable that the movement of the clamp <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and sides <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> could be motor-actuated. Loop <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include for example a motor-driven chain for driving carriages <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> at a constant velocity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Book&rdquo; as defined herein includes all sheet material assemblages. &ldquo;Clamp&rdquo; as defined herein can include any device holding a book. </paragraph>
