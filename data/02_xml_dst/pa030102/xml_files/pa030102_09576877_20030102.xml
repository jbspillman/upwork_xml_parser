<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Waste management has been primarily based on collection of waste and placing it in a landfill which has to be continuously monitored and maintained. Waste management by source eliminates a need for large landfills. Waste management by source integrates collection and transportation of waste with separation, treatment, processing, recovery, and reuse of waste. Current and future landfill sites can be primarily used for waste treatment and processing which eliminates open working front of a landfill operation and all associated odor and leachate problems. Waste is preferred to be separated into two primary groups of wet organic waste and dry waste most of which can be processed and recovered before it goes to a landfill. Therefore, present invention eliminates a need for permanently placed large landfills which become a continuous environmental, economical, and social threat to the surrounding communities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Prior art reviewed demonstrated that a number of methods and apparatus which improved a concept of large landfills which consist of burying waste under controlled environmental conditions and long term monitoring of said conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> However, prior art reviewed does not demonstrate a new comprehensive novel facility and utility system which will eliminate a concept of large landfills. Present invention makes collection and transportation of waste, a significant part of treatment, processing, recovery, and reuse prior to landfill application. A portion of said waste which is not recovered and reused is disposed in a small landfill or stored for further processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Waste is collected and transported as dry waste and wet organic waste most of which are separated at source and initially prepared for processing or treatment during the transportation. Prior to landfilling, said dry waste and wet organic waste are accepted by dry recovery process and wet recovery process respectively. Dry recovery process includes recovery and reuse of cellulose based materials such as paper, plastics such as high and low density plastics, yard waste such as grass clippings and trees, construction demolition materials such as concrete and iron bars, rubber and petroleum product material such as tires and geotextile. Wet recovery process includes recovery and reuse of mostly household kitchen waste, sludge from household septic tanks or other sources, and other wet organic waste such as waste from food and drink processing facilities with high BOD demand such as restaurants and hotels. Since most of the waste is processed and prepared for reuse prior to landfilling using present invention, only a small portion of waste is left for landfilling or further processing for reuse. Although it is preferred to eliminate a need for large landfill sites, present invention may be used in association with or as a part of a small or large landfill site depending on the waste stream and market conditions. One of the primary benefits of using present invention is elimination of open working front of a landfill operation and all associated odor and leachate problems related to wet organic waste portion of waste. The following is a partial list of benefits of the present invention through which </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> organic waste is separated and processed for reuse and is not buried as untreated wet organic waste in a landfill or bioreactor, and therefore </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> a large quantities of daily cover material are not needed resulting in cost reductions in operations associated with landfill and waste management, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> a working front of a landfill is eliminated or significantly reduced resulting in elimination of odor and associated local political considerations such as relocation of existing landfills at high costs to community at large, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> a need for an extensive leachate management system for organic compounds is eliminated resulting in reduction of potential groundwater and surface water pollution and associated environmental liabilities, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> a need for extensive gas management systems is also eliminated resulting in air pollution and associated cost reductions, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> a need for expensive and extensive curbside recycling is eliminated resulting in opportunities for more frequent waste collections with less complicated collection schedules. However, present inventions allows such recycling programs where it is found to be cost effective. </paragraph>
