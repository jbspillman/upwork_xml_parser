<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to lubricants formed with specific mineral base oils. More specifically, the invention relates to gear oils and transmission fluids which contain a mineral oil of lubricating viscosity which has an iodine number of less than and has a higher percentage of paraffinic saturates than cycloparaffinic saturates. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Gear oils and transmission fluids have been required recently to provide effective lubrication even in systems which are exposed to longer drain intervals and to higher temperatures. When the lubricant is exposed to these high temperatures, oxidation of the base oil occurs, usually at the points of unsaturation of the oils used in the lubricant. This oxidation leads to unacceptable viscosity change (increase) and reduced effectiveness of the lubricants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Lubricant formulators have sought to provide lubricants which have improved oxidation stability. Polyalphaolefins have been used as an alternative to mineral oils. The polyaphaolefins have low levels unsaturation and have good high temperature performance properties. However, polyalphaolefins are more expensive than mineral oils. Also, the polyalphaolefins generally have better low temperature performance that mineral oils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Mineral oils have been developed which provide improved oxidation properties. These mineral oils are generally referred to as Group II and Group III basestocks. These basestocks were developed for passenger car lubricants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> These basestocks cost less than polyalphaolefins. The Group II basestocks are generally worse in oxidation and low temperature performance than Group III basestocks. Group II and III basestocks have a high level of saturation. However, Applicants have discovered that oxidation and low temperature performance are affected by the type of saturated components in the oil. Group II stocks generally have a higher proportion of cyclic saturated components than aliphatic saturated components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The type of environment affects the oxidation of basestocks. In the passenger car motor oil area, the form of oxidation is caused by the increased acidic blow by-products from combustion of fuel in the engines, either diesel or gasoline fuel. These acidic combustion products act together with oxygen to enhance oxidation of the oils. In the gear and transmission area, the oxidation is different than those in passenger car motor oils. There are no acidic blow by-products to enhance oxidation of the oils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to have a Group III based transmission or gear lubricant which provides good oxidation performance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;hydrocarbyl&rdquo; includes hydrocarbon as well as substantially hydrocarbon groups. Substantially hydrocarbon describes groups which contain heteroatom substituents that do not alter the predominantly hydrocarbon nature of the substituent. Examples of hydrocarbyl groups include the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> (1) hydrocarbon substituents, i.e., aliphatic (e.g., alkyl or alkenyl) and alicyclic (e.g., cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl) substituents, aromatic-, aliphatic- and alicyclic-substituted aromatic substituents and the like as well as cyclic substituents wherein the ring is completed through another portion of the molecule (that is, for example, any two indicated substituents may together form an alicyclic radical); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> (2) substituted hydrocarbon substituents, i.e., those substituents containing non-hydrocarbon groups which, in the context of this invention, do not alter the predominantly hydrocarbon nature of the substituent; those skilled in the art will be aware of such groups (e.g., halo (especially chloro and fluoro), hydroxy, mercapto, nitro, nitroso, sulfoxy, etc.); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> (3) heteroatom substituents, i.e., substituents which will, while having a predominantly hydrocarbon character within the context of this invention, contain an atom other than carbon present in a ring or chain otherwise composed of carbon atoms (e.g., alkoxy or alkylthio). Suitable heteroatoms will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art and include, for example, sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen and such substituents as, e.g. parietal, furyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In general, no more than about 2, preferably no more than one heteroatom substituent will be present for every ten carbon atoms in the hydrocarbyl group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Typically, there will be no such heteroatom substituents in the hydrocarbyl group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the hydrocarbyl group is purely hydrocarbon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As previously indicated, the above combination of components are useful in lubricants where they can be used in automatic or manual transmission fluids, transaxle lubricants, gear lubricants, both for open and enclosed systems, tractor lubricants, metal-working lubricants, hydraulic fluids and other lubricating oil and grease compositions. In one embodiment, the lubricants contain less than 3% by weight water, or less than 2% by weight water, or less than 1% by weight water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The lubricants of the present invention include automatic transmission, manual transmission and gear lubricants. The transmission lubricants include those that meet the General Motor Dextron&reg; III and Ford Merco&reg; automatic transmission fluid requirements. In one embodiment, the lubricants include heavy duty or off road transmissions such as those that meet the Allison C-4 specification. In another embodiment, the lubricants are gear lubricants and include GL4, or GL5 lubricants. Additionally, in another embodiment, the lubricants are MT-1 lubricants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As described herein, the present invention relates to gear oil transmission fluid compositions which comprises a major amount of a basestock. The basestock is combined with functional additives to form the gear oil and transmission fluids. The basestock may be a singular component or may be a combination of components to be combined with functional additives to form the gear oil or transmission fluid. In one embodiment, the basestock comprises a major amount of the mineral oils discussed below (e.g., those having a high level of aliphatic saturates and a low iodine number). The minority of the basestock may be composed of other mineral oils or polyalphaolefins. Generally speaking, the basestocks are composed of at least about 60%, or at least about 75%, or at least about 85% by weight of the mineral oils discussed below (Group III basestocks). The gear oils and transmission fluid compositions of the present invention may additionally contain at least one functional additive. The functional additive adds an additional characteristic to the compositions in addition those properties provided by the basestock and/or polymer or fluidizing agent. Examples of such functions includes antiwear, extreme pressure, antioxidation, fluidity, friction modification, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Mineral Oils </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the mineral oils have an iodine number of less than 9 and have at least about 45% of the saturates present as aliphatic saturates. Iodine value is determined according to ASTM D-460. In one embodiment, the mineral oil has a iodine value less than about 8, or less than about 6, or less than about 4. The saturates level are determined by mass spectrometer. By mass spectroscopy, Group I stocks have about 70% saturates, Group II stocks have about 95% to about 98% saturates and Group III stocks have about 98%-100% saturates. Group II stocks have greater than 50% of their saturates present as cycloparaffinic compounds. The saturates of the mineral oils used in the present invention typically have at least about 45%, or at least about 50%, or at least about 60% aliphatic saturates. These aliphatic saturates are often referred to as paraffinic saturates. The cyclic saturates are generally referred to as cycloparaffinic saturates. Cyclic saturates compose the balance of the saturates in the mineral oils. The inventors have discovered that mineral oils having a higher proportion of aliphatic saturates have better oxidation properties and low temperature properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the lubricating compositions are prepared from a mineral oil having a kinematic viscosity of less than 8, or less than about 7, or less than about 6 cSt at 100&deg; C. Of course, it is understood that the mineral oil must have sufficient viscosity to act as a lubricating oil. Typically, the mineral oil has a kinematic viscosity of at least about 2, or at least about 3, or at least about 4 cSt at 100&deg; C. In one embodiment, the kinematic viscosity of the mineral oils is from about 3.0 to about 7.5, or from about 3.3 to about 7.0, or from about 3.4 to about 6.5. Typically, the mineral oils will have an SAE designation up to about 250 N, or up to about 150 N. Useful oils include 70N, 100N, 130N, 150N and 200N mineral oils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As use herein the term &ldquo;mineral oil&rdquo; refers to oils of lubricating viscosity which are derived from petroleum crude. The petroleum crudes may be subjected to processing such as hydroprocessing, hydrocracking, and isomerizing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Hydroprocessing includes processes such as sequential isocracking, isodewaxing and hydrofinishing. These mineral oils are those referred to as Group III basestock or base oils. In one embodiment, the mineral oil has less than 0.3% or less than 0.1% sulfur. In another embodiment, the oils of lubricating viscoisty generally have a viscosity index of 120 or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Examples of useful oils of lubricating viscosity include HVI and XHVI basestocks, such isomerized wax base oils and UCBO (Unconventional Base Oils) base oils. Specific examples of these base oils include 100N isomerized wax basestock (0.01% sulfur/ 141 VI), 120N isomerized wax basestock (0.01% sulfur/149 VI), 170N isomerized wax basestock (0.01% sulfur/ 142 VI), and 250N isomerized wax basestock (0.01% sulfur/ 146 VI); refined basestocks, such as 250N solvent refined paraffinic mineral oil (0.16% sulfur/89 VI), 200N solvent refined naphthenic mineral oil (0.2% sulfur/ 60 VI), 100N solvent refined/ hydrotreated paraffinic mineral oil (0.01% sulfur/98 VI), 240N solvent refined/hydrotreated paraffinic mineral oil (0.01% sulfur/ 98 VI), 80N solvent refined/ hydrotreated paraffinic mineral oil (0.08% sulfur/ 127 VI), and 150N solvent refined/ hydrotreated paraffinic mineral oil (0.17% sulfur/ 127 VI). Further examples of the mineral oils include those Group III basestocks made by Texaco such as the TXHVI stocks which include TEXHVI-100N (95% saturates, 125 viscosity index and 0.02% sulfur); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> TEXHVI-70N (97.8% saturates, 123 viscosity index and 0.02% sulfur); Texaco &ldquo;MOTIVA&rdquo; TEXHVI 90N-100N (100% saturates, 125 viscosity index and 0.01% sulfur); and &ldquo;MOTIVA&rdquo; TEXHVI 75N (100% saturates, 125 viscosity index and 0.0% sulfur). Examples of useful Group III basestocks made by Chevron include UCBO 200N (100% saturates, 142 viscosity index and 0.005% sulfur); UCBO 1OON (100% saturates, 129 viscosity index, and 0.004% sulfur). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Polymers </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The lubricating compositions may additionally contain (A) at least one polymer. The polymer generally is present in an amount from about 3% to about 40%, or from about 5% to about 35%, or from about 10% to about 30% by weight of the lubricating composition. The polymers include a polyalkene or derivative thereof, an ethylene-&agr;-olefin copolymer, an ethylene-propylene polymer, an &agr;-olefin-unsaturated carboxylic reagent copolymer, a polyacrylate, a polymethacrylate, a hydrogenated interpolymer of an alkenylarene and a conjugated diene, and mixtures thereof. Here, and elsewherein the specification and claims, any member of a genus (or list) may be excluded from claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the polymer (A) is characterized by an Mw (weight average molecular weight) of less than about 50,000, or less than about 45,000, or less than about 40,000. In one embodiment, the polymer has an {overscore (M)}w of less than about 25,000, or less than about 10,000, or less than about 7,000. Typically the polymer has an {overscore (M)}w of at least about 1,000, or at least about 2,000, or at least about 3,000. In one embodiment, the polymer (A) is characterized by an {overscore (M)}n (number average molecular weight) of up to about 6000, or up to about 5000. Generally, the polymer is characterized by having an {overscore (M)}n from about 800 to about 6000, or from about 900 to about 5000, or from about 1000 to 4000. In another embodiment, the polymers have a {overscore (M)}n from about 1300 to about 5000, or from about 1500 to about 4500, or from about 1700 to about 3000. The polymers also generally have a {overscore (M)}w/{overscore (M)}n from about 1.5 to about 8, or from about 1.8 to about 6.5, or from about 2 to about 5.5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the polymer may be a sheared polymer of higher molecular weight, e.g. greater than {overscore (M)}w 50,000. In this embodiment, a higher molecular weight polymer is sheared to the desired molecular weight. The shearing may be done in any suitable apparatus, such as an extruder, an injector, an FZG apparatus, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The abbreviation {overscore (M)}w and {overscore (M)}n is the conventional symbol representing weight average and number average molecular weight, respectively. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is a method which provides both molecular weights as well as the entire molecular weight distribution of the polymers. For purpose of this invention a series of fractionated polymers of isobutene, polyisobutene, is used as the calibration standard in the GPC. The techniques for determining {overscore (M)}n and {overscore (M)}w values of polymers are well known and are described in numerous books and articles. For example, methods for the determination of {overscore (M)}n and molecular weight distribution of polymers is described in W. W. Yan, J. J. Kirkland and D. D. Bly, &ldquo;Modern Size Exclusion Liquid Chromatographs&rdquo;, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1979. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the polymer (A) is a polyalkene. The polyalkene includes homopolymers and interpolymers of olefins having from 2 to about 40, or from 3 to about 24, or from 4 to about 12 carbon atoms.

References are the monosulfide, disulfide and trisulfide analogues to the sulfur composition for analysis. The references may be obtained by fractionating the product to form sulfide fractions (S1, S2 and S3) to be used for analysis. The procedure for analysis is as follows. (1) An area % determination is run on each of the reference samples to determine its purity. (2) An area % determination is run on the sample to be tested to get a general idea of its composition. (3) A calibration blend is accurately weighed based on the area % results of the sample to be tested: then the internal standard toluene, is added to the blend in an amount equal to approximately one-half of the weight of the largest component. (This should give an area approximately the same as that of the largest component.) (4) The weights of each component (i.e., S-1, S-2 and S-3) are corrected by the % purity from step 1. (5) The calibration blend is run in triplicate using the corrected weights and then calculated, using the following formula, to reflect the multiple peaks in S-1 and S-2:

<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the sulfur compound is prepared by reacting, optionally under superatmospheric pressure, one or more of the above olefins with a mixture of sulfur and hydrogen sulfide in the presence, or absence, of a catalyst, such as an alkylamine catalyst, followed by removal of low boiling materials. The olefins which may be sulfurized, the sulfurized olefin, and methods of preparing the same are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,119,549, 4,199,550, 4,191,659, and 4,344,854. The disclosure of these patents is hereby incorporated by reference for its description of the sulfurized olefins and preparation of the same. The polysulfide thus produced is fractionally distilled. In one aspect, the fractional distillation occurs under subatmospheric pressure. Typically the distillation pressure is from about 1 to about 250, from about 1 to about 100, or from about 1 to about 25 mm Hg. A fractionation column such as Snyder fractionation column may be used. In one embodiment, the fractionation is carried out at a reflux ratio from about 1:1 to about 15:1, or from about 2:1 to about 10:1, or from about 3:1 to about 8:1. The fraction distillation occurs at a temperature at which the sulfur composition which is being fractionated boils. Typically the fractional distillation occurs at a pot temperature from about 75&deg; C. to about 300&deg; C., or from about 90&deg; C. to about 200&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The conditions of fractional distillation are determined by the sulfur composition being distilled. Typically, the sulfur compound is heated to a temperature at which boiling occurs. The distillation system is brought to equilibrium and the distillation commences with a chosen reflux ratio. The fractions obtained from the distillation are removed from the distillation apparatus. The amount of the desired fraction may be calculated by determining the proportion of sulfides. The desired fraction is obtained by maintaining accurate temperature control on the distillation system. The boiling fractions are removed at a specific vapor and temperature for that fraction. The reflux ratio is adjusted to maintain the temperature at which this fraction boils. After removal of the desired fraction, the fraction may be further filtered as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In general, fractionation is carried out in a continuous or a batch process. In a continuous process, the material to be fractionated is fed to a fractionating column. Parameters are controlled in the system, such as feed flow, temperatures throughout the column, and the reflux ratio, etc., to separate the components in the feed into an overhead and bottoms stream. These parameters are adjusted to maintain the desired composition in the overhead and bottoms streams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> For a batch process, the material to be fractionated is charged to a vessel and is heated to boiling temperatures with agitation. Once the material reaches the boiling point, the fractionation column system is brought to equilibrium. Subsequently, the desired reflux ratio is set. Collection of the distillate is commenced, as described herein. The reflux ratio is increased as is necessary to maintain the appropriate temperatures in the fractionating column system. As the distillation rate slows, the reflux ratio is increased until eventually the collection of the distillate stops. The different fractions are separated as the above process is repeated at higher temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The following examples relate to sulfurized olefins. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, here, as well as throughout the specification and claims, the amounts are by weight, the temperature is in degrees Celsius and the pressure is atmospheric.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Sulfur (526 parts, 16.4 moles) is charged to a jacketed, high-pressure reactor which is fitted with an agitator and internal cooling coils. Refrigerated brine is circulated through the coils to cool the reactor prior to the introduction of the gaseous reactants. After sealing the reactor, evacuating to about 2 torr and cooling, 920 parts (16.4 moles) of isobutene and 279 parts (8.2 moles) of hydrogen sulfide are charged to the reactor. The reactor is heated using steam in the external jacket, to a temperature of about 182&deg; C. over about 1.5 hours. A maximum pressure of 1350 psig is reached at about 168&deg; C. during this heat-up. Prior to reaching the peak reaction temperature, the pressure starts to decrease and continues to decrease steadily as the gaseous reactants are consumed. After about 10 hours at a reaction temperature of about 182&deg; C., the pressure is 310-340 psig and the rate of pressure change is about 5-10 psig per hour. The unreacted hydrogen sulfide and isobutene are vented to a recovery system. After the pressure in the reactor has decreased to atmospheric, the sulfurized mixture is recovered as a liquid. The mixture is blown with nitrogen at about 100&deg; C. to remove low boiling materials including unreacted isobutene, mercaptans and monosulfides. The residue after nitrogen blowing is agitated with 5% Super Filtrol and filtered, using a diatomaceous earth filter aid. The filtrate is the desired sulfurized composition which contains 42.5% sulfur. </paragraph>

Through a sub-surface gas sparge, 1468 grams (26.2 moles) of isobutylene gas are fed into the reactor over a 5-hour period. The temperature is maintained between 45-50&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> At the end of the sparging, the reaction mixture increases in weight to 1352 grams. In a separate reaction vessel are added 2150 grams (16.5 moles) of 60% flake sodium sulfide, 240 grams (7.5 moles) sulfur, and a solution of 420 ml. of isopropanol in 4000 ml. of water. The contents are heated to 40&deg; C. The adduct of the sulfur monochloride and isobutylene previously prepared is added over a three-quarter hour period while permitting the temperature to rise to 75&deg; C. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux for 6 hours, and afterward the mixture is permitted to form into separate layers. The lower aqueous layer is discarded. The upper organic layer is mixed with two liters of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide, and the mixture is heated to reflux for 6 hours. The organic layer is again removed and washed with one liter of water. The washed product is dried by heating at 90&deg; C. and 30 mm. Hg. pressure for 30 minutes. The residue is filtered through diatomaceous earth filter aid to give 2070 grams of a clear yellow-orange liquid. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In a vessel with a fractionation column, the product of Example S-1 (10,000 grams) is brought to a boil, approximately 200&deg; F., under medium agitation. The column is brought to equilibrium by regulating the vapor temperature. The equilibrium is maintained for 30 minutes prior to collection of distillate. The reflux ratio is set at 5:1. Under these conditions, the distillate is collected until the accumulation of distillate is less than 5 ml in 15 minutes. The distillate (100 ml, 88 grams) is collected at a vapor temperature of 56&deg; C. The temperature of the vessel is raised 15&deg; F. An additional aliquot of 50 grams of distillate is removed , at a vapor temperature of 58&deg; C. Distillate (1863) is collected and is removed.

See, for example, page 8 of &ldquo;Lubricant Additives&rdquo; by C. V. Smalheer and R. Kennedy Smith (Lezius-Hiles Co. publishers, Cleveland, Ohio, 1967). Examples of useful pour point depressants are polymethacrylates; polyacrylates; polyacrylamides; condensation products of haloparaffin waxes and aromatic compounds; vinyl carboxylate polymers; and terpolymers of dialkylfumarates, vinyl esters of fatty acids and alkyl vinyl ethers. Pour point depressants useful for the purposes of this invention, techniques for their preparation and their uses are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,387,501; 2,015,748; 2,655,479; 1,815,022; 2,191,498; 2,666,746; 2,721,877; 2,721,878; and 3,250,715 which are herein incorporated by reference for their relevant disclosures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the pour point depressant is represented by the general structural formula: Ar(R)&mdash;(Ar&prime;(R&prime;))&mdash;Ar&Prime;, wherein the Ar, Ar&prime; and Ar&Prime; are the same as &ldquo;Ar&rdquo; discussed above, (R) and (R&prime;) are independently an alkylene group containing 1 to 100 carbon atoms with the proviso that at least one of (R) or (R&prime;) is CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and n is 0 to about 1000 with the proviso that if &apos;n is 0, then (R) is CH<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and at least one aromatic moiety has at least one substituent, the substituents being selected from the group consisting of a substituent derived from an olefin (preferably an olefin containing about 8 to about 30 carbon atoms, more preferably about 16-18 carbon atoms) and a substituent derived from a chlorinated hydrocarbon preferably containing about 8 to about 50 carbon atoms more preferably containing about 24 carbon atoms and about 2.5 chlorine atoms for each 24 carbon atoms. </paragraph>
