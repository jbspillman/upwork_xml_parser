<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing the same, more in detail to the semiconductor device including a circuit board mounting thereon a semiconductor chip by using solder bumps and the method for manufacturing the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> (b) Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A flip chip ball grid array (FCBGA) process is known as a packaging technique suitable for high-density mounting of a large-scale semiconductor integrated circuit (LSI). In the FCBGA process, the LSI is electrically and mechanically bonded to a circuit board of the package side by fixing solder balls having a higher melting point onto a plurality of electrode pads on the LSI and directly connecting the solder balls to respective electrodes of the circuit board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In a conventional method of manufacturing a semiconductor device in accordance with the FCBGA process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, solder balls <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are fixed onto the surface of an LSI (semiconductor chip) <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> corresponding to a plurality of electrode pads (not shown) before mounting (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>). Then, the fixed solder balls <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the LSI <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are connected to respective electrodes in a mounting pad of a circuit board <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for the FCBGA process as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There are problems in the FCBGA process that cracks are likely to be generated at portions connected by the solder due to a tensile stress generated by a difference in thermal expansion between the LSI <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the circuit board <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and that insufficient insulation resistance between electrodes is likely to occur due to a small space between electrodes, which are subjected to ingress of small conductive foreign substances and may have deficiencies such as deformation, protrusion and mixing of solder waste. In order to solve the problems, underfill resin <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is applied to the space between the LSI <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the circuit board <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for curing as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the resin insulation method, addition of the steps of applying and curing the underfill resin <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> increases the manufacturing cost. In addition, voids may be generated in the underfill resin <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to protrude the solder, thereby short-circuiting the adjacent electrodes. Thus, the inspection of the voids is separately required, which also increases the manufacturing cost. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to provide a semiconductor device and a method for manufacturing the same capable of reducing the manufacturing cost, and suppressing a short-circuit failure between electrodes without using insulation resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides, in a first aspect thereof, a semiconductor device including: a circuit board having a plurality of first electrodes thereon: a semiconductor chip having a plurality of second electrodes thereon corresponding to the first electrodes: a bonding sheet sandwiched between the circuit board and the semiconductor chip and having a plurality of apertures corresponding to the first and second electrodes; and a solder bump disposed in each of the apertures for connecting a corresponding one of the first electrodes and a corresponding one of the second electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides, in a second aspect thereof, a method for manufacturing a semiconductor device including the steps of: forming a solder bump on each of first electrodes of a semiconductor chip or on each of second electrodes of a semiconductor chip, first electrodes being disposed corresponding to the second electrodes; sandwiching between a circuit board and the semiconductor chip a bonding sheet having a plurality of apertures corresponding to the first and second electrodes so that the apertures receive the respective solder bumps; and melting the solder bumps for electrically connecting the first electrodes and the respective second electrodes through the solder bumps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the first and the second aspects of the present invention, the semiconductor device can be manufactured without a conventional step of applying resin between the semiconductor chip and the circuit board, because the solder bumps are engaged in apertures of the bonding sheet located between the semiconductor chip and the circuit board, thereby removing the cost for conducting the step Also a short-circuit failure between the electrodes can be effectively prevented because the solder bumps are securely maintained in the apertures and are surround by the bonding sheet in which a void is hardly generated. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Now, the present invention is more specifically described with reference to accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> plurality of column-shaped solder bumps <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having a height of, for example, about 100 to 120 &mgr;m are formed on electrodes (not shown) of mounting pads of a circuit board <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In the column-shaped solder bump <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the strength thereof against the stress increases and the distance between the adjacent solder bumps <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be larger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In an exemplified configuration, the thickness of the LSI <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is set at about 700 &mgr;m, with the thickness of the circuit board <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> about 1.2 mm, the pitch of the solder bumps about 240 &mgr;m, the number of the solder bumps about 3000, and the gap between the LSI <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the circuit board <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> after the mounting about 100 &mgr;m. The gap is preferably set at about 100 to 90% of the height of the column-shaped solder bump <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In addition, the plane view dimensions of the LSI <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the portion in contact with the solder (surface wetted by solder) on the LSI <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> side and the portion in contact with the solder on the circuit board <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> side may be set at about 13.64 mm&times;13.64 mm, about 130 &mgr;m&times;130 &mgr;m and about 130 &mgr;m&times;130 &mgr;m, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The whole solder bump <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be formed by high melting-point solder. The high melting-point solder is used if the LSI <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can withstand a temperature as high as the melting point of the solder, which reduces the cost because the use of expensive eutectic solder is unnecessary. The solder bump <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having a two-layer structure may be used in which the circuit board side (fixed end side) of the column shape is formed by the high melting-point solder and the LSI side (free end side) is formed by the eutectic solder. In this case, a working temperature of about 220 to 240&deg; C. is sufficient, and the connection treatment can be conducted at a lower temperature than in the case of using the high melting-point solder in the LSI side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The eutectic solder is made of a brazing metal having a lower melting point of 183&deg; C., and the working temperature thereof is about 220 to 240&deg; C. The high melting-point solder is made of brazing metals having a melting point (liquidus) higher than the working temperature of the brazing metal having the lower melting point, and contains about 95% of palladium. The melting point thereof is 317&deg; C. and the working temperature is 330 to 350&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The solder bump <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the circuit board can be formed by disposing the solder bump on a jig and transferring the solder bump onto the circuit board, or by a plating. When the jig is used for forming the column-shaped solder bump, the arrangement of the solder bump is somewhat difficult. When the plating is used, a significant number of solder bumps can be prepared at a time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> bonding sheet (insulation sheet) <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is affixed onto the surface of the LSI <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The bonding sheet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be made of thermoplastic polyimide resin, and the bonding sheet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is free from voids such as formed in the underfill resin applied to the space between the circuit board and the LSI in the prior art. The bonding sheet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> has a plurality of cylindrical apertures (engagement apertures) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which can receive the solder bumps <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> at corresponding portions of electrode pads (not shown). The cylindrical aperture has a depth same as or similar to the height of the solder bump <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the circuit board <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the LSI <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are pressed against each other while the respective solder bumps <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are engaged in the corresponding cylindrical apertures <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This LSI <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is mounted on the circuit board <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> after the solder bumps <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are thermally melted to be connected to electrode pads on the LSI <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The thermally melting treatment is conducted at about 220 to 240&deg; C., and the bonding sheet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is softened and deformed while keeping the stickiness. Accompanied thereby, the respective central portions of the solder bumps <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> outwardly expand to increase the diameters of the respective central portions of the cylindrical apertures <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that the solder bumps <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are not pulled out from the apertures <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, a sufficient amount of solder exits as the solder bumps <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on the circuit board <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> side, and no preparatory solder is necessary on the LSI <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> side. A small amount of solder may be welded or plated in advance as the preparatory solder, if necessary, on the portions connected by the solder for improving the wettability of the solder and increasing the volume of the solder at the time of the bonding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Since the solder bump <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> inserted into the cylindrical aperture <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the bonding sheet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is bonded to the LSI <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the solder bump <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is not excessively deformed, and the resin for insulation is unnecessary. The bonding sheet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> existing between the LSI <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the respective electrodes of the pad and between adjacent solder bumps effectively prevents a short-circuit failure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the present embodiment, the solder bump <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is mounted on the circuit board <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the bonding sheet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is mounted on the LSI <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. However, it may be reversed: the solder bump <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be mounted on the LSI <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with the bonding sheet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> mounted on the circuit board <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Since the above embodiments are described only for examples, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments and various modifications or alternations can be easily made therefrom by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
