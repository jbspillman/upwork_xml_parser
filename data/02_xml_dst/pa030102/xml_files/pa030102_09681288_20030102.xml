<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Optical, magnetic and magneto-optic media are primary sources of high performance storage technology which enables high storage capacity coupled with a reasonable price per megabyte of storage. Use of optical media has become widespread in audio, video, and computer data applications in such formats as compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD) including multi-layer structures like DVD-5, DVD-9, and multi-sided formats such as DVD-10, and DVD-18, magneto-optical disk (MO), and other write-once and re-writable formats such as CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD&plus;RW, DVD-RAM, and the like, hereinafter collectively &ldquo;data storage media&rdquo;. In these formats, data are encoded onto a substrate into a digital data series. In pre-recorded media, such as CD, the data are typically pits and grooves formed on the surface of a plastic substrate through a method such as injection molding, stamping or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recordable media, the data are encoded by laser, which illuminates an active data layer that undergoes a phase change, thus producing a series of highly-reflecting or non-reflective regions making up the data stream. In these formats, a laser beam first travels through a plastic substrate before reaching the data layer. At the data layer, the beam is either reflected or not, in accordance with the encoded data. The laser light then travels back through the plastic and into an optical detector system where the data are interpreted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In some applications, it is desirable to have a limited life for an optical disc. For example, sample computer programs are provided to potential customers in order to entice them to purchase the software. The programs are intended to be used for a limited period of time. Additionally, music and movies are currently rented for a limited time period. In each of these applications and others, when that time has expired, the disc must be returned. A need exists for machine-readable optical discs that do not need to be returned at the end of a rental period. Limited-play discs provide a solution to this problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Limited play discs have been produced in various fashions. One method comprised forming a disc where the reflective layer is protected with a porous layer such that the reflective layer becomes oxidized over a pre-determined period of time. Once the reflective layer attains a certain level of oxidation, the disc is no longer readable. The problem with this and other limited play techniques is that these techniques are defeatable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> If the method for providing limited play to optical discs can be easily defeated by a customer or a cottage industry, discs would no longer be &ldquo;limited-play&rdquo;. In the case of a coating or material rendering an optical disc unplayable, for example, facile removal or modification of that coating and/or material could provide a disc with unlimited playability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There is a great desire on the part of movie studios to protect their intellectual property. Commercialization of limited-play data storage media that can be easily defeated to afford data storage media with unlimited playability would present an unacceptable risk of losing intellectual property. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The method for making limited-play data storage media comprises a substrate with a reactive layer and a UV coating. Upon exposure to oxygen, a reactive material, e.g., leuco methylene blue, which is essentially colorless, is oxidized to form an opaque or semi-opaque layer (e.g., the deep blue dye, methylene blue). Data storage media with the opaque/semi-opaque layer can no longer be played in media players. By adjusting the time it takes to turn opaque, this method can be used to provide limited-play data storage media having the desired life for the given application. However, it has been found that limited-play discs prepared solely with the reactive material layer, in this manner, are easily &ldquo;defeated&rdquo;, e.g., in a bleach test, so that they are no longer &ldquo;limited-play&rdquo;. The additional use of an ultra violet (UV) curable topcoat to discs with a reactive layer affords limited-play data storage media that cannot be defeated in the bleach test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The data storage media comprises a substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> having low birefringence and high light transmittance at the read laser wavelength, i.e., is readable in an optical media device, a reactive material reactive layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a UV coating <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a data storage layer <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and a reflective layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>) The substrate <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> can comprise material having sufficient optical clarity, e.g., a birefringence of about &plusmn;100 nm or less, to render the data storage material readable in a media device. Generally, polycarbonates are employed. In theory, any plastic that exhibits these properties can be employed as the substrate. However, the plastic should be capable of withstanding the subsequent processing parameters (e.g., application of subsequent layers) such as sputtering temperatures of about room temperature (about 25&deg; C.) up to about 150&deg; C., and subsequent storage conditions (e.g., in a hot car having temperatures up to about 70&deg; C.). That is, it is desirable for the plastic to have sufficient thermal stability to prevent deformation during the various layer deposition steps as well as during storage by the end-user. Possible plastics include thermoplastics with glass transition temperatures of about 100&deg; C. or greater, with about 125&deg; C. or greater preferred, about 150&deg; C. or greater more preferred, and about 200&deg; C. or greater even more preferred (e.g., polyetherimides, polyetheretherketones, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polyetherethersulfones, polyphenylene ethers, polyimides, polycarbonates, etc.); with materials having glass transition temperatures greater than about 250&deg; C. more preferred, such as polyetherimide in which sulfonedianiline or oxydianiline has been substituted for m-phenylenediamine, among others, as well as polyimides, combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing plastics, and others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Some possible examples of substrate materials include, but are not limited to, amorphous, crystalline, and semi-crystalline thermoplastic materials such as: polyvinyl chloride, polyolefins (including, but not limited to, linear and cyclic polyolefins and including polyethylene, chlorinated polyethylene, polypropylene, and the like), polyesters (including, but not limited to, polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polycyclohexylmethylene terephthalate, and the like), polyamides, polysulfones (including, but not limited to, hydrogenated polysulfones, and the like), polyimides, polyether imides, polyether sulfones, polyphenylene sulfides, polyether ketones, polyether ether ketones, ABS resins, polystyrenes (including, but not limited to, hydrogenated polystyrenes, syndiotactic and atactic polystyrenes, polycyclohexyl ethylene, styrene-co-acrylonitrile, styrene-co-maleic anhydride, and the like), polybutadiene, polyacrylates (including, but not limited to, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), methyl methacrylate-polyimide copolymers, and the like), polyacrylonitrile, polyacetals, polycarbonates, polyphenylene ethers (including, but not limited to, those derived from 2,6-dimethylphenol and copolymers with 2,3,6-trimethylphenol, and the like), ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, polyvinyl acetate, liquid crystal polymers, ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene copolymer, aromatic polyesters, polyvinyl fluoride, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinylidene chloride, tetrafluoroethylenes (e.g., Teflons) </paragraph>

Further included are reaction products and combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing photoinitiators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The UV layer may also optionally comprise flatting agents, surface active agents, thixotropic agents, UV light stabilizers, UV absorbers and/or stabilizers such as resorcinol monobenzoate, 2-methyl resorcinol dibenzoate, and the like, as well as combinations reaction products comprising at least one of the foregoing. The stabilizers can be present in an amount, based upon the weight of the uncured UV layer of about 0.1 wt %, preferably about 3 wt %, to about 15 wt %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Having met the defeatability test, limited-play data storage media with a reactive layer (e.g., poly (methyl methacrylate)/leuco methylene blue basecoat) and a UV cured topcoat were tested for playability. Upon initial exposure to oxygen, the disc was playable. During longer exposure to oxygen, the disc gradually turned blue as the leuco methylene blue was oxidized and ultimately became non-playable. This was surprising since nearly all UV cured acrylic resins are crosslinked materials, and a variety of cross linked materials are known to be barriers to oxygen, and since the protective layer could be UV cured without causing the reactive layer to oxidize prematurely. For example, transparent barrier coatings applied by electron beam evaporation have recently been reviewed (ref: Proceedings, Annual Technical Conference&mdash;Society of Vacuum Coaters 1998, Soc. of Vacuum Coaters, Albuquerque, N. Mex., USA. p. 424-428). If oxygen could not diffuse through the UV topcoat to the leuco methylene blue in the reactive layer, oxidation of the leuco methylene blue would not occur to form methylene blue which is required for limited playability, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> A second benefit of having a UV cured topcoat was discovered, as follows. The rate of oxidation of the leuco methylene blue to methylene blue was determined by measuring the percent reflectivity of coated discs. The percent reflectivity is related to the amount of incident light, arrow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, that is absorbed in passing through several layers, including a PMMA/leuco methylene blue layer, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The percent reflectivity is the ratio of transmitted light, arrow <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to incident light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As more methylene blue is formed by oxidation of leuco methylene blue, the amount of light reflected from the aluminum surface in a data storage media is reduced since the methylene blue that is formed absorbs some of the incident and reflected light. A typical kinetics curve result is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> for a PMMA/leuco methylene blue coating on a data storage media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Ideally for a limited-play data storage media, it would be desirable to have no loss of percent reflectivity for a period of time so that the limited-play data storage media would play impeccably in every type of data storage media player Alternatively, having a very high percent reflectivity (e.g., an initial percent reflectivity of about 75% or greater), with a maintained percent reflectivity of about 65% or greater for the desired period of time, meets the most customer requirements. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> above, percent reflectivity falls immediately as leuco methylene blue in PMMA is exposed to air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Surprisingly it has been found that when a UV topcoat is applied to a PMMA/lecuo methylene blue basecoat, the time is extended before the percent reflectivity begins to fall relative to a basecoat that has no topcoat, shown below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Thus high reflectivity is maintained longer so that playability in a data storage media player can be guaranteed for a longer period of time. Specifically, it has been found that some types of data storage media players do not play data storage media when the percent reflectivity is 45% or less. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it can be seen that when there is no UV topcoat on the PMMA/leuco methylene blue basecoat, the percent reflectivity reaches 45% in about 1 to about 2 hours whereas it takes about 4 to about 8 hours when a UV topcoat is present. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> This example describes preparation of PMMA/leuco methylene blue coating solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> A solution of PMMA in 1-methoxy-2 propanol was prepared by adding 60 grams of Elvacite 2010 poly (methyl methacrylate) from Ineos Acrylics to 300 grams of 1-methoxy-2 propanol in a bottle and rolling on a roller mill to effect dissolution. The solution was transferred to a flask and heated to about 80&deg; C. while a slow stream of nitrogen was passed over the surface of the solution. The de-aerated solution was transferred using nitrogen pressure to a de-aerated bottle closed with a rubber septum using a cannula tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A leuco methylene blue solution was prepared by combining 1.2 grams of methylene blue trihydrate and 0.80 grams of camphor sulfonic acid with 40 grams of 1-methoxy-2 propanol in a 100-mL flask equipped with a rubber septum. The stirred mixture was heated in a 90&deg; C. water bath while a stream of nitrogen was passed into the flask using syringe needles for both the nitrogen inlet and outlet. While hot, 4.2 milliliters (mL) of tin (11) 2-ethylhexanoate was added by syringe to reduce the methylene blue to the dark amber leuco methylene blue. To the solution was added 0.6 mL of polyether modified poly-dimethyl-siloxane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> To make the PMMA/leuco methylene blue coating solution, the leuco methylene blue solution above was drawn into a syringe and then injected into the PMMA solution after having been passed through a 0.2-micron syringe filter. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Example 2 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> This example illustrates the preparation of a disc with the PMMA//leuco methylene blue layer. Approximately 3 mL of the Example 1 PMMA/leuco methylene blue coating solution was applied as a ring around the inner diameter of a DVD held on a spin coater. After spin coating at 500 rpm for 60 seconds, the coating was tack-free and essentially colorless (e.g., a percent reflectivity of about 65%). The disc was placed a DVD player and was completely playable. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Example 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The coated disc from Example 2 was allowed to stand at ambient room conditions during which time average percent reflectivity was measured at various times using a Dr. Schenk PROmeteus MT-136E optical disk tester. As the percent reflectivity dropped the color of the disc turned from essentially colorless to blue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> After the disc had been in air for about 1 week, it was very blue and would not play in a DVD player; e.g., the disc had a percent reflectivity of about 10%. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Example 4 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> This example illustrates that the disc described in Examples 2 and 3 is defeatable. The blue disc from Example 3 was placed in a solution of 3 parts by weight of household bleach and 7 parts by weight of water. After standing in this solution overnight, the disc was again colorless (i.e., a percent reflectivity of greater than about 50%) and the coating appeared to have been removed. Another disc prepared in the same fashion as the one in Example 2 was placed in a closed container above a bleach solution. After standing overnight, the blue color in the PMMA coating was gone. Both discs were completely playable in a DVD player. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The solution was used to apply a PMMA/leuco methylene blue basecoat to a DVD the same as in Example 2 except the discs were spun at 500 rpm for 3 seconds and then at 1,000 rpm for 7 seconds. The average coating thickness was 2.6 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> After one of the discs with the PMMA/leuco methylene blue basecoat had been stored overnight in a nitrogen chamber, UV resin, a mixture of acrylates commonly known as Daicure SD-640 (commercially available from DaiNippon, Inc., and Dic Trading, USA, Fort Lee, N.J.) was applied to it in the manner described in Example 2, spun at 1,000 rpm for 3 seconds, and passed under a UV lamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The kinetics of oxidation of a disc with just the basecoat and that of another with the UV topcoat on the basecoat were determined in the manner of Example 3.
