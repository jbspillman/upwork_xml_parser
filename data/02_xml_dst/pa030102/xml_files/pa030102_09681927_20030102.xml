<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An automotive instrument panel (IP) has a thermostatically controlled electric heating element for maintaining the plastic material of the IP at a temperature warm enough to inhibit brittle fracture during deployment of an airbag mounted within the IP. The heating element is formed by depositing a layer of electrically conductive material on an inner surface of the outermost layer of the IP along the perimeter of an airbag deployment path, bonding the outermost layer to a substrate, and using a laser to simultaneously score the IP around the deployment path and cut the conductive layer so that it forms a circuit through which electric current may be passed for resistance heating. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing an enclosure for an automotive passenger restraint airbag. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of forming an electric heating element in or on the enclosure to ensure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,070,901 teaches a method of manufacturing an automotive instrument panel (IP) wherein a laser is used to score the IP in order to form an invisible seam around an airbag deployment opening in the IP. The laser is directed from a position adjacent the inner surface of the multi-layer IP and cuts through all but the outermost layer of the IP to form a fracturable airbag deployment path that offers minimal resistance to deployment of the airbag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A consideration in the design of IPs and other types of airbag enclosures is the fact that many plastic materials from which these structures are typically formed tend to become brittle at low temperatures. For proper functioning of the airbag, it is necessary that the portion of the enclosure covering the airbag and through which it deploys be formed of a material that will remain suitably soft and ductile throughout a broad range of ambient operating temperatures. This consideration results in the ruling out of many plastics that, because of other desirable characteristics, might otherwise be appropriate for use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,372,379 teaches an automotive IP having a thermostatically controlled electric heater disposed adjacent a deployment plate or opening, the heater maintaining the structure adjacent the airbag at a desired minimum temperature. The heater eliminates the need to select an IP covering material that does not become unduly brittle at low temperatures, thus reducing the number of compromises that must be made during the design of the IP. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to an improved and simplified method of manufacturing an automotive airbag enclosure, such as an instrument panel (IP), having an opening for deployment therethrough of an airbag and an electric heating element disposed adjacent the opening for protecting against brittle fracture of the enclosure during deployment of the airbag. The method is adapted for use with a process for forming a seamless airbag cover wherein a laser is used to score a multi-layer IP construction from the inside, cutting completely through all but the outermost layer covering the airbag prior to deployment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the invention, the method comprises the steps of forming a layer of an airbag enclosure having outer and inner surfaces, providing an electrically conductive strip adjacent the inner surface of the layer to define at least a portion of a perimeter of the airbag opening, and directing a high intensity light beam toward the strip to completely penetrate the strip. The laser divides the strip into two parallel conductive paths, whereby the strip may be supplied with electric current and serve as the electrical heating element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention may be easily manufactured because the covering, conductive strip, plate, foam and substrate are all assembled prior to forming an aperture in the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These and other advantages of the present invention will become more apparent in the course of the following detailed description and appended claims. The invention may best be understood with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein illustrative embodiments are shown.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the invention as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> teaches a method of manufacturing an instrument panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a concealed airbag (not shown) located therein in a position to protect an occupant of the passenger seat (not shown) against frontal impact. The depicted embodiment is generally similar to the instrument panel disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,070,901, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an exploded perspective view of an automotive instrument panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally comprising a plastic molded substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a molded flexible covering <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a generally rectangular opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> therein and is formed in the usual manner of injection molding from materials selected to be durable, lightweight and low-cost. Suitable materials for the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> include polyolefin. Especially preferred is polystyrene or styrene malaeic anhydride (SMA). The covering <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is pre-molded in the final desired shape for attachment to the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Suitable materials for the covering <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> include thermoplastic olefins. Especially preferred are thermoplastic urethanes, polyvinyl chlorides (PVC) or PVC-urethane blends. A variety of methods are known for molding the flexible covering including slush molding, thermoform molding, vacuum molding and injection molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A steel plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is generally rectangular and is slightly curved to match the contours of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a generally U-shaped slot <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a first end <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and defining a flap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the center of the plate. The plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is preferably manufactured from relatively soft (low carbon) steel that offers little resistance to bending so that the flap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may fold along a folding axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> when the force of the deploying airbag is applied against the flap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A plurality of fasteners <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are welded or otherwise secured to the plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at points around its perimeter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> An electrically conductive strip <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is applied to the inner or concave surface of the covering <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the conductive strip <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is in the generally shape of a U matching the outline of the slot <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and has two short stems <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> extending downwardly from the bottom of the U. Conductive strip <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is preferably copper or a copper alloy and may be applied to the covering <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by any appropriate process, such as silk-screening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> To assemble the components shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is first secured to the substrate by inserting the fasteners <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through holes in the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> adjacent the opening <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The covering <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is then positioned over the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the two components spaced a fixed distance apart. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The distance between the covering <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> forms a space for receiving a foam <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Suitable foam materials include polymer foams. Especially useful are polyurethane foams, which demonstrate good adhesion to each of the substrate, covering and plate. When the foam <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> cures, it secures the covering <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the plate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> After the foam <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> had cured, a focused light beam <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> such as that produced by a laser <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is used to score the instrument panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Laser <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is positioned adjacent the back surface of substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and directs light beam <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> onto the substrate at a position aligned with slot <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The laser cuts through the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, passes through the slot <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, then cuts through foam <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and conductive strip <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Laser <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> moves parallel to the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> over a pattern precisely following the slot <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that the light beam <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> passes through the slot at all times. The intensity of beam <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the rate at which it is moved are carefully controlled such that the beam only partially penetrates the covering <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the covering <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is scored from the inside along a path matching the shape of the slot <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to form an easily fracturable opening path to permit deployment of the airbag, while the outer surface of the covering displayed to the passengers is not visibly marred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the beam <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> cuts conductive strip <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> along its centerline, dividing the strip into two adjacent, parallel conductive paths separated by a narrow gap <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The beam <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> does not cut all the way to the upper ends <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the strip, but rather leaves the upper ends intact so that the conductive paths are connected to form a continuous circuit terminating at the stems <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Electric wires <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are connected to the stems <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and to an electrical circuit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> for providing direct current. An example of a suitable electrical circuit is shown to include wire <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>connected to an electric power source <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, a vehicle ignition switch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and a switch <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and wire <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>connected to ground <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Switch <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is preferably a thermostat calibrated to close when the sensed temperature falls below a predetermined minimum. When ignition switch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is in a position to supply power to the circuit <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, closing of switch <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> allows current to flow through the strip <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> so that it serves as a heating element to warm the covering layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The heat provided by strip <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> maintains the portion of covering layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> adjacent the score line at a temperature warm enough to prevent brittle fracture of the covering layer during deployment of the airbag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> An airbag (not shown) is secured to the under surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a manner well known in the inflatable restraint art, for example by means of the attaching fasteners <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The instrument panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is installed within a vehicle (not shown). In the event of a collision, the airbag inflates and pushes the flap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> outwardly as it deploys. The covering <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> fractures along the score line formed by the laser, allowing the desired deployment of the airbag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention is not limited to an instrument panel or any particular an airbag location or type of enclosure, but rather may be practiced in relation to an airbag located anywhere within the passenger compartment of a vehicle. Examples of other possible airbag types and locations include: a driver airbag located inside a steering wheel assembly; a side airbag located inside a seat; and a side curtain airbag inside a headliner or adjacent a roof rail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the invention as defined by the following claims. </paragraph>
