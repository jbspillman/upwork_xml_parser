<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to cooling devices and, more particularly, to controlling and monitoring cooling devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> At least some known cooling devices include a compressor to compress a refrigerant and an evaporator to evaporate the refrigerant. During an evaporation process, a temperature of the refrigerant lowers and absorbs heat providing a cooling of a main compartment of the cooling device. The evaporated refrigerant is compressed by the compressor and then condensed into a liquid state by a condenser. Several processes may cause ice to accumulate within the cooling device. Over time, ice accumulation may lower a cooling efficiency of the cooling device. Therefore, the cooling devices are occasionally defrosted to remove accumulated ice to prevent a failure of the cooling device which may cause spoilage of contents stored within the cooling device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> To facilitate preventing a cooling device failure, some known cooling devices are controlled and/or monitored. One known control technique employs an electronic thermostat such as a model TC-110 electronic thermostat commercially available from Elstat Electronics LTD, Lancashire, England. The thermostat is coupled to the cooling device to provide temperature control of the coupled cooling device at that particular cooling device&apos;s location. Therefore, a plurality of cooling devices at different locations are not controllable from one location using a known thermostat. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> During operation of cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) including attached control <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a control device permits wireless control of cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. More specifically, a user can specify an upper and lower setpoint for cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, wherein the upper setpoint refers to a temperature at which attached control <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> directs cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to activate a cooling system (not shown) of cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the lower setpoint refers to a temperature at which attached control <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> directs cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to de-activate operation of the cooling system. Alternatively, the user specifies a setpoint and a differential or temperature range about the specified setpoint. In a further embodiment, cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a heating device and the user specifies a negative differential. For example, cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is programmed to heat main compartment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to 100&deg; C. with a negative differential of 10&deg; C. and when main compartment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> reaches 90&deg; C., (programmed temperature minus negative differential) then cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> re-heats main compartment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to 100&deg; C. The user can also specify a plurality of defrost parameters including a defrost interval, a defrost duration, and a defrost method. The defrost interval refers to a length of time that elapse between consecutive defrost cycles. The defrost duration refers to a length of time that the defrost cycle will run. The defrost method can be off-cycle, heating element, or hot refrigerant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The defrost parameters also include a maximum allowable appliance temperature during defrost, and a maximum allowable evaporator temperature during defrost. The appliance temperature refers to the temperature inside main storage compartment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Additionally, as used herein, unless otherwise stated, all temperatures refer to a temperature inside main storage compartment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, the upper and lower setpoint temperatures refer to the temperature of main storage compartment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The evaporator temperature refers to the temperature of the evaporator. If either maximum allowable temperature is reached during a defrost cycle then the defrost cycle is ended regardless of the specified defrost duration. Otherwise, if neither maximum allowable temperature is reached, then the defrost cycle continues until the specified defrost duration is complete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The defrost parameters also include a fan stop choice during defrost indication that enables a user to specify whether a fan is on or off during a defrost cycle. Alternatively, the user can specify a fan delay such that the fan is on during a portion of a defrost cycle. The defrost parameters also include a message on display during defrost. The user can specify that the temperature of cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> before a defrost cycle is started is displayed during the defrost cycle. Alternatively, the actual temperature of cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during a defrost cycle is displayed. The user can also specify that the letters DEF are displayed during a defrost cycle. Additionally, the user utilizes the control device to specify whether or not cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be manually defrosted. When the user specifies that cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be manually defrosted, then attached control <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be used to manually defrost cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When the user specifies that cooling device can not be manually defrosted, then attached control <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can not be used to manually defrost cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The user also utilizes the control device and attached control <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to specify a plurality of alarm parameters including an alarm delay parameter and an alarm buzzer enablement parameter. The alarm delay parameter represents an amount of time that elapses before an alarm is signaled after detecting an alarm condition. The alarm buzzer enablement parameter allows the user to specify whether a buzzer (not shown) of attached control <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will sound during an alarm condition. Regardless of the status of the alarm buzzer enablement parameter, attached control <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> always communicates an alarm to the control device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The alarm parameters also include an alarm interval parameter and an alarm duration parameter. The user utilizes the alarm interval parameter to specify a minimum time period between alarms. The alarm duration parameter allows the user to specify a desired alarm duration. For example, the user enables the alarm buzzer and specifies an alarm duration of thirty seconds and an alarm interval of five minutes. When an alarm condition occurs, the buzzer sounds for thirty seconds and will not sound again until after the five minute time period elapses regardless of whether or not the alarm condition persists. If the alarm condition still persists after the alarm interval period has elapsed, then the buzzer will sound again for the specified alarm period. Typical alarm conditions include a low temperature alarm, a high temperature alarm, and a blocked condenser alarm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the user can specify via the control device whether the compressor operates during an alarm condition. The user also specifies a minimum compressor rest time, and whenever the compressor turns off, the compressor will not cycle back on until after the specified time elapses. Attached control <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is configured to allow the user to specify via the control device a display stability, a display speed, and whether display <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is on or not. The display speed refers to a length of time that a temperature is displayed before a different temperature is displayed. The display speed refers to increasing and decreasing temperatures. The display stability refers to a length of time that a temperature is displayed before a higher temperature is displayed. For example, in one embodiment, main storage compartment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is accessible by a door (not shown), and when the door is opened, the temperature inside main storage compartment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> rises quickly, and when the door is then closed, the temperature then lowers quickly. The display stability allows for a distinction between a sharp temporary temperature rise due to an open door versus an extended temperature rise. Furthermore, the user can specify the time zone that cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is located in, and whether to display temperatures in Fahrenheit or Celsius. The user can also select a data interval in either minutes or hours. The data interval refers to how often attached control <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> transmits data including current status to the control unit. Attached control <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to a condenser sensor (not shown) and an evaporator sensor (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Attached control <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can perform a failure a failure analysis based upon any alarm conditions and feedback from the condenser and evaporator sensors, as well as a temperature sensor in main storage compartment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment, the sensors are negative temperature coefficient (NTC) sensors. The user also utilizes the control device to specify a brightness level for display <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Display <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is configured to display an indication that cooling device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is currently being defrosted. Display <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is also configured to display indications of a refrigeration system failure, a high temperature alarm, a low temperature alarm, and an electrical fault condition or short. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Display <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is also configured to display indications of sensor failures including a main compartment sensor failure, an evaporator sensor failure, and a condenser sensor failure. Attached control <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> also includes a memory that stores an average temperature, a lowest registered temperature, a highest registered temperature, and the number of door cycles in time zone. Attached control <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is programmable such that time zones for data collection can be specified by the user. For example, a user programs a twenty-four hour time zone for a cooling unit including a door (not shown), and attached controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> counts the number of times that the door is opened within the twenty-four hour time zone. After each time zone, the count is reset to zero. The memory also stores the number of times the compressor has cycled on and a cumulative number of compressor operating hours. Display <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is configured to display the average temperature, the highest registered temperature, the lowest registered temperature, the number of door cycles, the number of compressor cycles, and the cumulative compressor operating hours. </paragraph>
