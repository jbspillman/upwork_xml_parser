<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to x-ray generating devices, and more particularly, to an improved x-ray generating device having a field emission array for generating the electron beam in the x-ray device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Current x-ray generating device technology utilizes thermionic filaments typically made of tungsten. A single x-ray generating device will usually have more than one tungsten filament in an effort to provide several x-ray spot sizes for different applications. The tungsten filaments operate at high temperatures and have a typical short life expectancy on the order of several hundred to one thousand hours of operation. The life expectancy of the filament is limited due to the high operating temperature, which causes the tungsten filament to erode and deform. In addition, thermionic filaments require a high current supply to operate at such high temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Some thermionic filaments may have a complex filament design, i.e. a coil or a helix, modeled to tailor a temperature profile on the emitting surface. The electron emission current density is a function of the temperature. Precise control of the temperature implies a precise control of the focal spot current density and thus, the X-ray emission pattern. Some filaments are made from a flat tungsten sheet, rather than a tungsten coil. Prior art flat filaments provide a better focal spot than helical filaments. Also, electrons are emitted from hot edges. These electrons are difficult to focus and reduce the system efficiency and the quality of the focal spot. In an attempt to focus the electron beam, a bias voltage may be added to the cathode cup of the x-ray generating device. The bias voltage suppresses edge electrons and provides additional beam focusing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is generally desirable to improve the efficiency and performance of an x-ray generating device and to increase the life expectancy of the device. Additionally, it is desirable to reduce the complexity and cost of x-ray generating devices and the systems in which they are used. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is therefore one object of the invention to provide an x-ray generating device having a filament that operates at room temperature without the need for high currents. It is another object of the invention to provide a robust, low cost x-ray generating device. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an efficient x-ray generating device that has a life expectancy in excess of 1,000 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the invention, a method and system is provided for generating an electron beam in a x-ray generating device. According to the present invention, the x-ray generating device has a field emission array (FEA) for generating the electron beam. The FEA usually operates at room temperature and is capable of generating a current density in excess of prior art thermionic emitters. According to the present invention, the electron beam is generated using bias voltages on the order of 50-100 V, for example. The bias voltage can be adjusted if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon the following detailed description and appended claims, and upon reference to the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the following figures the same reference numerals will be used to identify the same components in the various views. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a perspective view of the cathode portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of an x-ray generating device having a field emission array electron source according to the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of the x-ray generating device cathode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> taken along line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and shows an electron source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a cross sectional view of the x-ray generating device cathode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> taken along line <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Referring generally to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the electron source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made of a field emission array electron emitter, which will be described in detail hereinafter. The x-ray generating device cathode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operates at room temperature using low gate voltage field emission and therefore does not require an additional high current thermionic filament supply that typically adds cost and complexity to the operation of the generating device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The FEA source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> emits an electron beam that propagates in a direction indicated by reference number <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The electron beam can be focused by a generally concave-shaped portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the x-ray generating device cathode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The concave shape <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is located on a portion of the cathode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that is facing the direction of propagation for the electrons in the electron beam emitted by the source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the source <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a field emission array. Some background of field emission array (FEA) technology is useful in understanding the present invention and its advantages to x-ray generating device technology. FEA&apos;s were originally developed for flat panel display devices, such as computer screens, television screens, etc. The FEA is fabricated by making a semiconductor/insulator/conductor sandwich. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a perspective view of an array of emitters, shown as cones in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is cross-sectional view taken along line <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4 a</cross-reference> top conductor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, or gate, has openings <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> etched therein. The openings <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are typically on the order of 1 to 3 microns in diameter. Inside each opening <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is a cavity <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and an emitter <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the emitter has a sharp cone form. The cone s typically made of a suitable metal such as molybdenum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The emitters are arranged in an array as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, which would make up the filament of the present invention. Each emitter has an effective emitting area, typically on the order of 1.2&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;15 </superscript></highlight>cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and is capable of producing 50-150 microamps of current when an electric field at the tip <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) of the emitter is sufficiently high. Current technology for fabricating the FEA&apos;s can produce cone-packing densities in excess of 6.4&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>cones/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and therefore total current densities of over 10 A/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. These densities are far higher than current thermionic cathodes. The difference is that instead of a single electron gun spraying electrons that are focused into an electron beam, there are as many as 500 million cones <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in an array spraying electrons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Field emitter arrays have been formed using the Spindt technique in which a metal, such as molybdenum, is evaporated into a masked hole in a dielectric. The evaporated metal is first filtered in order to form a very directional beam of material. The cone tips are fabricated using this or any other method known to one of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the Spindt emitter, i.e. the pointed cone at the center of a well formed by a hole in the anode layer, is not the only field emission arrayed emitter. There are several other alternatives that can be substituted for the Spindt emitter described herein that accomplish similar results. For example, hollow cylindrical structures <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, as well as other exotic types such as carbon nanotube emitters <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, that have a potential applied to a gate structure to produce emission may be substituted without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Using an FEA filament to generate the electron beam in a x-ray generating device according to the present invention provides many advantages. The FEA filament operates at room temperature, and is not a heat source. Therefore, the filament does not deform and erode by evaporation. The FEA filament is much more robust than the tungsten filament typically used in x-ray generating devices. In addition, it has been shown through testing that FEA&apos;s have a life expectancy in excess of 12,000 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The electron emission is only produced on the upper surface of the FEA. Therefore, there are no edge effects in the x-ray generating device of the present invention. Prior art cathode designs are generally inefficient because they are known to be difficult to focus and have undesirable edge effects. Focusing electron beams in prior art x-ray generating devices is typically accomplished by suppressing electrons by adding bias to a cathode in the x-ray generating device. Without edge effects, the problems associated with focusing the electron beam in the prior art are not experienced with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference> showing the generally concave shape <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the x-ray generating device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in an area surrounding the filament <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which generally focuses the beam. For each emitter tip <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the amount of electrons coming off the tip <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> are controlled by applying a bias voltage <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> between the tip <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the opening <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. A typical bias voltage may be on the order of 0 to 100 V. The electric field produced by the bias voltage also shapes the individual electron beam from the cone tip <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, also called a beamlet. The cathode cup shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> focuses the beam that is made up of all the individual beamlets. The cup shapes the electric field between the cathode and the anode, or target, to get the desired beam size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> An FEA behaves like a perfectly isothermal surface. Therefore, when the same bias voltage is applied to each cone, the same amount of current is emitted. Prior art filaments typically require a complex filament design model to tailor a temperature profile for the emitting surface. This is not necessary for the filament in the present invention because it behaves like a tungsten filament having a uniform temperature, without the need for complex filament design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The FEA filament used in the present invention has a very long life since it operates at room temperature. Therefore it is more robust than conventional tungsten filaments that are deformed by exposure to high temperatures. Moreover, only one filament is required in a generating device. Prior art generating devices typically have more than one tungsten filament, which not only increases the cost of the generating device, but also introduces coincidence problems. With the single FEA filament in the present invention, there are no coincidence problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In a practical application of prior art generating devices, more than one tungsten filament is used for procedures that require a large x-ray spot size and a small x-ray spot size. However, when there are two tungsten filaments side by side in a cathode cup as in the prior art, the resultant electron beams hit the target at slightly different locations. The distance between the spots on the target is called the coincidence distance. It is desirable to have a coincidence distance that is as close to zero as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With current FEA technology it is possible to address each emitting emitter electronically. Therefore, it is possible to control the size of the emitting surface by producing a large spot size and a small spot size, both being centered on the same point in a cathode cup. According to the present invention, exciting a portion of the emitter array that less than the entire emitter array surface or exciting the entire emitter array surface allows control of the spot size. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is an example of a large spot <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is created by exciting the entire emitter surface. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is an example of a small spot <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> created by exciting only the middle portion of the FEA source. The coincidence distance is zero because both the large and the small spots come from the same location on the emitter and are subject to the same electric fields. Because of the elimination of multiple filaments for different sized spot rays, the present invention will allow the manufacture of substantially smaller cathode cups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Further, the present invention can dynamically alter the beam shape by applying different bias voltages to different parts of the FEA electron source. For example, the power of the x-ray beam at a specific location may be increased or decreased merely by changing the bias voltage applied to that particular area of the FEA. Shaping the electron beam is an important feature in that it becomes possible to maximize the total power that the x-ray generating device can withstand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the beam can by wobbled at high frequencies. Focal spot wobble is a highly desired feature for many applications including optimizing the performance of CT scanners. According to the present invention, individually addressing different areas of the emitter effectively wobbles the beam. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> are examples of wobbling the beam by applying the bias voltage the right side of the emitter, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, and then applying the bias voltage to the left side of the emitter, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The bias voltages are applied alternatively at a predetermined frequency such that the beam wobbles from left to right. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> are only one example of many possible configurations for beam wobbling that would be configured according to a specific application, which one skilled in the art is capable of determining. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The FEA electron source according to the present invention generates the electron beam using simple, inexpensive electronic components, which will significantly reduce the cost of the generating device. Likewise, FEA electron sources can be made in large batches resulting in a further reduction in the cost of the generating device. For example, a FEA is produced as a fourteen square inch screen for flat panel displays sold in the consumer electronics market. Because the technology is used in the competitive consumer electronic market, the manufacturing cost must be low and therefore it is expected that the cost to manufacture the FEA filament for a x-ray generating device would also be low. New advances in the FEA manufacturing technology are improving the applicability of typical FEA&apos;s to vacuum levels and ion-backbombardment rates associated with the x-ray generating device further increasing the operating life of the x-ray generating device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in connection with one or more embodiments, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to those embodiments. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents, as may be included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
