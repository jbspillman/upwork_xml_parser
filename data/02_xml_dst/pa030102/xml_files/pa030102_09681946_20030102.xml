<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to computerized systems and methods for assuring process compliance for a wide array of processes and, more specifically, to web-based systems and methods for the creation and sharing of project templates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Businesses utilize a variety of processes in their day-to-day operations. These processes may involve the completion of a number of discrete steps, forming a project. For example, businesses may utilize a variety of processes for bringing new products to market, often collectively referred to as new product introduction (NPI) processes. NPI processes may involve, for example, initial product conception, product design, product manufacture, and post-shipment follow-up. Typically, such processes include a series of tollgates, or go/no-go points. Each tollgate may include a set of activities and each set of activities may include a set of tasks. Typically, such processes also include a series of issues and risks which must be monitored, tracked, and addressed. While NPI processes are often very similar, they may be customized based upon the needs of a particular business or the requirements associated with a particular product. As a result, NPI processes may vary with respect to focus, steps, and nomenclature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Traditionally, businesses have kept track of the steps comprising a project manually on paper, or with the aid of locally-accessible computer programs, such as spreadsheets and project management applications. Such systems and methods, however, have several important limitations. Such systems and methods are not generic and new papers or spreadsheets must be generated, for example, each time a new product is introduced, or when a new business utilizes an existing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, when locally-accessible project management applications are used, information related to tollgates, activities, tasks, issues, and risks must be transferred from user to user via a computer-readable medium, such as on a diskette. Even then, simultaneous updates are not possible. In general, process compliance is difficult to ensure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Limitations of even globally-accessible, web-based systems and methods include the inability to ensure that projects are created in a consistent manor, and that all required steps of the project are included. A further limitation of such systems and methods is that businesses have invested in legacy spreadsheet-based systems that are time consuming to manually load into a globally-accessible process compliance system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus, what is needed are web-based systems and methods for easy capture, documentation, and maintenance of business processes in a globally-accessible system. What is also needed are systems and methods for the creation and sharing of project templates which are used for importing/exporting data into/out of a globally-accessible system in order to ensure that approved, generic processes are followed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the above limitations and provides systems and methods for the creation and sharing of project templates in order to monitor projects and ensure approved processes compliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a computerized method for managing process compliance includes creating a project template, inputting project related information into the project template, transferring the project template to a globally-accessible system, searching and identifying projects within the globally-accessible system, and monitoring and tracking the projects using the globally-accessible system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a computerized system for managing process compliance includes a project template module operable for creating, storing, and transferring a project template into a globally-accessible system, a project compliance management module operable for receiving, storing, and searching the project template, a processor operable for manipulating information related to the project, and a communications network operable for communicating information related to the project to and from a plurality of remote users.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in one embodiment, a computerized system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for inputting and transmitting project related data into a project compliance management module <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for the purpose of managing and monitoring a project includes a project creator formatting or creating a project template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that may be inputted into the computerized system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When a new project is created, the project creator may select an appropriate template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from a list of existing templates. A project template module <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> automatically creates a new project template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the computerized system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The templates are selected by project creators to facilitate the creation of projects in a computerized process compliance system of which a web-based NPI system is an example. Selecting the template may create all of the projects associated tollgates, activities, tasks, issues, and risks. The project template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> allows the creator to schedule and assign tollgates, activities, tasks, issues, and risks. The project template module <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> allows for the transfer of the project related data to a project compliance management module <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which may be utilized to assist in the management of a predetermined project. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in one embodiment, a computerized method <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for managing process compliance associated with a project allows a remote user to log into a globally-accessible system and create and store project-related information such as tollgates, activities, tasks, issues, and risks <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A project template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is selected and information is entered. The template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is loaded into a globally-accessible system <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a project is created <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from the template. The project may be searched <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, monitored <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and updated <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The globally-accessible system preferably includes a web page which contains or is in communication with a project compliance management module <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a project template module <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The web page is preferably secure and may include a plurality of dynamic menus, drop-down lists, links, and the like displayed on a graphical user interface. Through the web page, a project creator, a project leader, a project manager, a team member, an activity or task performer, or any other authorized remote user may view information, submit information, and query the system. After a project template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has been created and stored, the project template module <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> transfers/receives data to/from the project compliance management module <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The data may include information such as tollgates, activities, tasks, issues, and risks. The data may further include project identification information such as name, business location, name of data file, user name, where in the database the information is going to go, and any additional field. Once a project template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is selected, the template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is used to create a project. The project template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> allows the tollgates, activities, tasks, issues, and risks to be inputted in a standard way which ensures uniform quality and consistency among projects. Once a project is created using a selected template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the data may be used to search among one or a plurality of projects, search within one or a plurality of projects, or identify a project based upon predetermined criteria <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Predetermined criteria may include any aspect of a project that a user of the system may inquire about. Once a tollgate, activity, task, issue, risk, or project has been searched and identified <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, its status may be monitored <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, tracked, and updated <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> by a remote user <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. For example, the project compliance management module <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may allow the status of a tollgate, activity, task, issue, or risk to be tracked over its life-cycle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, or over the life-cycle of a given project <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The project template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> operates as a pattern for a project. By selecting a template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from a list of predetermined templates, the project creator is provided with a list of a project&apos;s associated information. As discussed above, information may be related to tollgates, activities, tasks, issues, risks, names, or any other project related information. The project template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be used for keeping track of project-related information and the steps associated with a project. The information may be provided to the creator by the template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, or information may be manually added, deleted, and updated. The project template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> ensures that project quality remains consistent by providing users with process guidelines provided in the templates <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, the template <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes one or a plurality of spreadsheets. An example of a suitable spreadsheet application includes Microsoft Excel&trade; (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Wash.). The spreadsheet allows for the capture, documentation, and maintenance of project processes. Information contained within the spreadsheet is imported into the project compliance management module <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, where the information may be monitored and managed for process compliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in one embodiment, a computerized system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for project management includes a remote user <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> linked to a project management web page <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> via a globally-distributed computer network <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, such as the Internet or an intranet, and/or a local area network/wide area network (LAN/WAN) <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. This link may be established along one or more data communication lines <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, or via wireless interfaces. The remote user <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may view, submit, and query information at the project management web page <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> through a browser application run by a computer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, such as a desktop or laptop personal computer. Through the project management web page <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the remote user <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is linked, through a firewall <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, to the project compliance management module <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and the project template module <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) which operate on project-related data. The project management web page <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may reside in a persistent storage device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, such as an application server, a web server, a file server, or a database server. The system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is set up such that the server <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may communicate information to and acquire information from a plurality of remote users <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in one embodiment, the project compliance management module <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and project template module <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) comprise one or more computer programs which acquire project-related data, store and archive the data, manipulate the data, and formulate outputs which may be viewed and queried by the remote user <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The project compliance management module <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and project template module <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> preferably reside within the system memory device <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of a computer system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which may, optionally, be an application server, a web server, a file server, or a database server.

The central processor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may include an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), which performs arithmetic and logic operations, and a control unit, which extracts instructions from the system memory device <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The operating system <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may include a set of instructions which control the internal functions of the computer system <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. For example, the operating system <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may recognize input from input devices, send output to output devices, keep track of directories and files, and control various peripheral devices. Suitable examples of operating systems <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> include, but are not limited to, those manufactured by Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Palo Alto, Calif.), Microsoft Corporation (Redmond, Wash.) and Apple Computer, Inc. (Cupertino, Calif.). A system bus <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> may communicate signals, such as address signals, data signals, and control signals, between the system memory device <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the central processor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, and one or more peripheral ports <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The system memory device <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may also contain an application program <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and a basic input/output system (BIOS) <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. The application program <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> cooperates with the operating system <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and the one or more peripheral ports <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. The GUI <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> typically includes a combination of signals communicated along a keyboard port <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, a mouse port <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a monitor port <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and one or more drive ports <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The BIOS <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> may interpret requests from the operating system <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and interface with such ports to execute the requests. Accordingly, suitable input/output devices include a keyboard, a mouse, a monitor, a printer, a plotter, speakers, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The systems, methods, programs, and processes described in relation to the present invention are not limited to any particular computer system.
