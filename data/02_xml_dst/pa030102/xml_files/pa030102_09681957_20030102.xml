<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to circuit breakers, and more particularly, to electronic communicating residential circuit breakers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The ability to communicate to residential circuit breakers enables numerous value adding functions and applications, such as lighting control, load shedding and remote diagnostics. Additionally, transmission of data throughout a residence facilitates performing home automation functions such as home security and appliance controls. Communicating to residential circuit breakers has generally involved separate communications wiring and power that is available when the breaker is both open and closed and a separate power supply to power a re-close motor. However, separate communications wiring and power supply increases the cost and complexity implementing communicating residential circuit breakers. Residential electrical systems can be used for data communication within a residence. For existing residences, wiring in the electrical systems is advantageous to use because, in most instances, use of such wiring facilitates installation of a communication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Additionally, data can be transmitted over a residential electrical wiring system. In such a system, due to residential wiring conventions, a large percentage of data transmissions are routed through a load center, sometimes called a breaker box or fuse box. The load center is the incoming point for electrical service to the residence and wiring for the residence branches out from the load center. The load center includes a plurality of fuses or circuit breakers for the protection of the various circuits within the residence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The elimination of the separate power supply and communications wiring would reduce cost and simplify the installation process. Thus, it would be desirable to eliminate separate power supply and communications wiring in a communicating residential electrical system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of a system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for communicating with a residential load center in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. System <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a residential wiring system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and at least one electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> electrically connected to residential wiring system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected to a power source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by voltage line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and neutral line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, thereby providing electrical power to residential wiring system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> protected by electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Residential wiring system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes at least one load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which is electrically connected to circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> via residential wiring system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a fuse protected communications and control circuit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and at least one of a re-close mechanism <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a tripping mechanism <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a fault detection module <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and an interrupter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> One side of electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected to power source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> while another side is connected to wiring system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in a &lsquo;Closed&rsquo; state, power flows from power source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. One function of electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is to provide protection to components using current flowing from electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, such as load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, from damage caused by electrical anomalies such as overcurrent, undervoltage, arc fault, and ground fault conditions. Electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provides protection by interrupting current, or removing power, to the down stream components when an electrical anomaly occurs. For example, in an overcurrent condition, fault detection module <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> senses parameters such as current in the line and neutral wires of load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and monitors for fault conditions. If a fault occurs, fault detection module <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> sends a tripping signal to tripping mechanism <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, which causes interrupter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to interrupt current flow through electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, placing electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in an &lsquo;Open&rsquo; state. Once circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in an &lsquo;Open&rsquo; state, all power is removed from wiring system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and no current is allowed to flow to load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> until electronic communicating circuit breaker is reset to the &lsquo;Closed&rsquo; state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also communicates with a controller (not shown) allowing the controller to perform functions and applications such as lighting and appliance control, home security management, load shedding, and remote diagnostics of electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> allows communication with electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. More specifically, fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes a communication and control circuit <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> that enables and controls communication to and from electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, thereby providing remote operation and diagnostics of electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment, the controller is connected to wiring system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> anywhere that has power, and control circuit <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> enables power line communications such that wiring system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is utilized to transmit data among the controller, electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. To communicate using wiring system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, control circuit <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> utilizes a commercially available power line carrier protocol such as Lon Works, provided by Echelon Inc. In another embodiment other communication methods, such as cellular, radio frequency, and twisted power wire, are used to communicate among the controller, electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Additionally, fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes fuse <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which provides fault protection for control circuit <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is located on the power source side of electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. If a fault occurs, fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is not protected from damage by fault detection module <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, tripping mechanism <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and interrupter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Therefore, communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> incorporates fuse <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to protect control circuit <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and circuit breaker control modules, such as re-close mechanism <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, tripping mechanism <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, interrupter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and fault detection module <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, from possible damage caused by electrical anomalies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Utilizing communications and control circuit <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> controls operation of electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by communicating with circuit breaker control modules such as fault detection module <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, re-close mechanism <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, tripping mechanism <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and interrupter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. For example, fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> controls the &lsquo;Opening&rsquo; and &lsquo;Closing&rsquo; of interrupter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. To &lsquo;Open&rsquo; interrupter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> sends a signal to tripping mechanism <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, which in turn sends a signal to interrupter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to interrupt the flow of current though electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> resulting in an &lsquo;Open&rsquo; state of electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In another example, fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is used to re-close interrupter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> returning electronic communicating circuit breaker to a &lsquo;Closed&rsquo; state. When tripping conditions are safe for closure of electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> sends a signal to re-close mechanism <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Re-close mechanism <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> then causes interrupter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to close allowing current to flow from power source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, through electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, to load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Re-close mechanism <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is any device or mechanism capable of closing interrupter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, such as a small motor, or a solenoid. Additionally, re-close mechanism <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> receives power from fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Since fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is located on the power source side of electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, power is available to re-close interrupter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> when electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in both an &lsquo;Open&rsquo; state and a &lsquo;Closed&rsquo; state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is used to control load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, such as lighting fixtures, stereo equipment, and other adjustable devices by communicating with load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via wiring system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment, fuse protected communication and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> communicates with fault detection module <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to provide diagnosis of electrical flow through electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and diagnosis of electrical anomalies that occur. Fault detection module <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> monitors parameters, such as current through electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and when a fault occurs, provides diagnostic and amplifying data regarding the nature of the fault to fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> then sends the data to the controller. For example, fault detection module <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> transmits the status of monitored parameters to fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and when a fault occurs, reports fault type information, such as overcurrent, undervoltage, and arc fault, and the electrical conditions that caused the fault. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is coupled between voltage line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and neutral line <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on the power source side of electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The circuit breaker control modules are coupled between fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the load side of electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Having fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> coupled to the power source side, and the control modules coupled to the load side, allows communication among fuse protected communications and control module <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the circuit breaker control modules, load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the controller regardless of whether electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in the &lsquo;Open&rsquo; state or the &lsquo;Closed&rsquo; state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagram of one embodiment of a residential load center <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that utilizes communication system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Components in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> identical to components in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are identified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> using the same reference numerals as used in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A supply of power (not shown) is routed from an electric supplier, either underground or otherwise, and is connected to a customer&apos;s residence or business (not shown) at an electric meter (not shown) at which point the electric wiring enters the customer residence providing power source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to load center <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Load center <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may also be called a fuse box or a breaker box. In one embodiment, inside load center <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, power source <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is divided into individual circuits by a plurality of electronic communicating circuit breakers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The individual circuits form residential wiring system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and distribute electrical power throughout the residence to a plurality of loads <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Each electronic circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected to one of a plurality of loads <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which are included in residential wiring system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is any device, or plurality of devices that draw electrical current. For example, load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be a single device such as a clothes drier, a furnace, or a hot water heater, or load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be multiple devices connected in parallel or multiple electrical outlets connected in parallel, such as a plurality of electrical outlets in one room supplying current to lights, fans, televisions, and stereo equipment. Each electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a fuse protected communications and control module (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) that communicates, via wiring system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, with each load <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that is connected to the respective electronic communicating circuit breaker <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Additionally, all electronic communicating circuit breakers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> communicate with, and are controlled by, one controller. However, in an alternate embodiment, certain electronic circuit breakers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> communicate with one controller, and other electronic communicating circuit breakers <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> communicate with a different controller. By using multiple controllers, designated sections of residential wiring system <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are controlled by different controllers, allowing different areas of a residence to be individually controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The electronic communicating circuit breaker utilizes a fuse protected control module to enable power line communications to a residential circuit breaker regardless of whether the breaker is &lsquo;Open&rsquo; or &lsquo;Closed&rsquo;. The fuse protected control module also provides power to a re-close mechanism when the breaker is in an &lsquo;Open&rsquo; state, allowing remote closing of the circuit breaker without the need for a power source separate from the residential wiring power source. Functionality performed by the fuse protected communications and control module includes remote opening and closing of the circuit breaker as well as reporting diagnostic and amplifying data about the electronic communicating circuit breaker and the load connected to the circuit breaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in terms of various specific embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the claims. </paragraph>
