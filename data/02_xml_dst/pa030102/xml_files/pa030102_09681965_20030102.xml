<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention provides a strategy to stop a parallel HEV powertrain engine while maintaining smooth vehicle response to driver demand using the motor while simultaneously opening an engine disconnect clutch. In the preferred embodiment, the strategy stops an engine (based on, for example, driver demand), disconnects the disconnect clutch to the powertrain, halts fuel to the engine, and predicts a desired motor/generator speed. The prediction of desired motor/generator speed can be: a trajectory comparison based on present and past vehicle velocity and deceleration or on a vehicle accelerator position, or a determination of whether the vehicle is in speed following control mode. The system can also add additional strategies such as accelerate the strategy if a vehicle brake is applied. The gradual takeover by the motor occurs by proportionally decreasing actual engine torque until engine torque is zero while maintaining vehicle velocity using for example a proportional plus integral controller. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), and specifically to a strategy to stop an engine in an HEV with minimal torque disturbance to the powertrain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The need to reduce fossil fuel consumption and pollutants from automobiles and other vehicles powered by internal combustion engines (ICEs) is well known. Vehicles powered by electric motors have attempted to address these needs. However, electric vehicles have limited range and limited power coupled with the substantial time needed to recharge their batteries. An alternative solution is to combine both an ICE and electric traction motor into one vehicle. Such vehicles are typically called hybrid electric vehicles (HEV&apos;s). See generally, U.S. Pat. No. 5,343,970 to Severinsky. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The HEV has been described in a variety of configurations. Some HEV patents disclose systems where an operator is required to select between electric and internal combustion operation. In other configurations the electric motor drives one set of wheels and the ICE drives a different set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Other, more useful, configurations have developed. A series hybrid electric vehicle (SHEV) is a vehicle with an engine (most typically an ICE), which powers a generator. The generator, in turn, provides electricity for a battery and motor coupled to the drive wheels of the vehicle. There is no mechanical connection between the engine and the drive wheels. A parallel hybrid electrical vehicle (PHEV) is a vehicle with an engine (most typically an ICE), battery, and electric motor combined to provide torque to power the wheels of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A parallel/series hybrid electric vehicle (PSHEV) has characteristics of both the PHEV and the SHEV. The PSHEV is also known as a torque (or power) splitting powertrain configuration. Here, the torque output of the engine is given in part to the drive wheels and in part to an electrical generator. The generator powers a battery and motor that also provides torque output. In this configuration, torque output can come from either source or both simultaneously. The vehicle braking system can even deliver torque to drive the generator to produce charge to the battery (regenerative braking). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The desirability of combining the ICE with an electric motor is clear. The ICE&apos;s fuel consumption and pollutants are reduced with no appreciable loss of performance or vehicle range. A major benefit of parallel HEV configurations is that the engine can be turned off during periods of low or no power demand from the driver (e.g., waiting for a traffic light). This improves fuel economy by eliminating wasted fuel used during idle conditions. The motor can then propel the vehicle under conditions of low power demand. In some configurations, the engine can be disconnected from the motor and powertrain when it is not running by opening a disconnect clutch. As power demand increases, the engine can be restarted and reconnected to provide the requested torque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Developing a strategy to stop an HEV engine and transfer primary torque production of the powertrain from the engine to the motor or to set the vehicle to idle conditions with minimal torque disturbance is needed for successful implementation of a parallel HEV. If the engine is connected to the powertrain, stopping the engine would involve maintaining the vehicle&apos;s response to the driver&apos;s demand using the motor while simultaneously opening a clutch that connects the engine to the powertrain (disconnect clutch) and stopping the engine. Torque supply to the powertrain should be transferred from the engine to the motor smoothly in order to avoid any disturbance to the driver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Strategies to turn off an HEV&apos;s engine are known in the prior art. See generally, U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,881 to Egami et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,993,351 to Deguchi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,067,801 to Harada et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 6,083,139 to Deguchi et al. Unfortunately, no simple and cost sensitive strategy is known to stop a parallel HEV engine while maintaining a smooth vehicle response to driver demand using the motor while simultaneously opening a clutch that connects the engine to the powertrain (disconnect clutch). </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention provides a strategy to stop a parallel HEV engine while maintaining a smooth vehicle response to driver demand using the motor while simultaneously opening a clutch that connects the engine to the powertrain. In the preferred embodiment, the HEV powertrain has an engine, a motor/generator, a power transfer unit (such as an automatic transmission, planetary gear set, or an electronic converterless transmission), and an engine disconnect clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The strategy stops the engine (based on, for example, driver demand) by predicting and commanding a desired motor/generator speed, halting fuel to the engine, and opening the disconnect clutch to the powertrain. Next the strategy calculates a desired motor/generator torque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The prediction of a desired motor/generator speed can be a trajectory comparison based on, for example, vehicle velocity and deceleration at a present time and at some past time or on a vehicle acceleration controller (such as an accelerator or brake) position. Predicting the desired motor/generator speed can also include a determination of whether the vehicle is in speed following control mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The system can also add additional strategies such as a termination strategy if the acceleration control is applied aggressively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Other objects of the present invention will become more apparent to persons having ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention pertains from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Although the preferred embodiment described is for a parallel HEV, the invention could be applied to any vehicle using a motor and an engine as the drive source having an engine disconnect clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows general components of a parallel HEV powertrain with an engine disconnect clutch. An engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is linked to a motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, via a disconnect clutch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The powertrain has a vehicle system controller (VSC) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has an additional motor control unit and inverter (MCU) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A battery <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> connects to the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to allow the flow of electrical current to and from the two components. The motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is connected to a powertrain power transfer unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (such as an automatic transmission, a planetary gear set (power-split), or an electronic converterless transmission), that is connected to the vehicle&apos;s wheels <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, torque and energy flow from the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the power transfer unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to the wheels <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, both the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be directly coupled to the wheels <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, so that both power sources can independently provide torque to the vehicle powertrain. The configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> employs the disconnect clutch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> between the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to allow a temporary disconnection of the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the wheels <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The motor, in addition to propelling the vehicle, can also be operated as a generator for use in charging the battery <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> using the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or through regenerative braking. Regenerative braking uses the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to recover vehicle braking energy to charge the battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a strategy to stop a parallel HEV engine, while maintaining a smooth vehicle response to driver demand or other vehicle conditions, using the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and simultaneously opening the disconnect clutch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that connects the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the vehicle powertrain. The preferred embodiment of the strategy of the present invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. It is noteworthy at the outset that the strategy can be configured to accelerate completion at any point if a vehicle brake system is applied (such as when a brake pedal is depressed) or abort at any point if vehicle acceleration control is aggressively applied (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the preferred strategy for stopping the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in an HEV parallel powertrain configuration. Initially, the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is commanded to be in speed following control mode. At the same time, a desired angular speed command is also sent to the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. If the power transfer unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is engaged, the desired motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> angular speed (&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>mot</subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight></subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>des</subscript></highlight>) is calculated according to:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>mot</subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight></subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>des</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;&lsqb;v</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>t</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>)&plus;((<highlight><italic>v</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>t</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>)&minus;<highlight><italic>v</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>t</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight>))/<highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight>)*<highlight><italic>kT&rsqb;*C.</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In this formula: &ldquo;v(t<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>)&rdquo; is the vehicle speed when an engine stop mode <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is entered (i.e., at time&equals;&ldquo;t<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;); &ldquo;T&rdquo; is a sample time between measurements of vehicle speed; &ldquo;k&rdquo; is a number of measurement sample intervals since t<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>; and &ldquo;C&rdquo; is the kinematic conversion factor from vehicle speed to motor/generator angular speed and can include wheel radius, final drive ratio, and gear ratio. The constant &ldquo;C&rdquo; converts linear vehicle speed at the wheels to angular motor/generator speed. This method effectively uses the vehicle&apos;s velocity and acceleration at the beginning of the engine stop event to estimate the vehicle&apos;s velocity at some future time (t<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>)&plus;kT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Though not shown here, an alternative algorithm for calculating the desired speed trajectory could utilize a map from accelerator or brake position to desired vehicle speed, which could then be translated to desired motor/generator speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In general, the strategy compares actual vehicle speed (as translated to motor/generator speed) to the desired value once the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is under speed control. When the speed error falls below a calibratable tolerance (Tolerance <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the controller directs the vehicle system controller (VSC) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to halt fuel to the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the controller commands the disconnect clutch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to open. Although not shown in the flowchart, the speed error could also be required to stay below the calibratable tolerance for a fixed amount of time in order to guarantee that the speed control has stabilized the system at the desired speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> While the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is decelerating, it could still impart an undesirable torque on the vehicle powertrain if the disconnect clutch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is even partially closed. Therefore the shutdown strategy does not end until the disconnect clutch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is completely open. Since the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is in speed following control mode during the engine stopping strategy, the strategy compensates for any torque disturbances caused by the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by modifying its torque output in order to maintain the vehicle at the desired speed. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> disconnect clutch position sensor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is shown as the measurement signal used for determining whether or not the clutch is still partially closed. Other signals (e.g., clutch apply pressure) could also be used for this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> During the entire engine stopping strategy of the present invention, a vehicle braking system status (such as brake position) can be monitored for any changes. At any point when the vehicle brakes are applied, the engine stopping strategy can be accelerated by immediately halting fuel to the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and commanding the disconnect clutch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to open completely. The engine stop strategy is then immediately exited to one of several alternative vehicle states, depending on the vehicle operating status. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The strategy begins with a command from an engine controller such as the vehicle system controller (VSC) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to enter the engine stop mode at Step <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Initially, the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is commanded to run in speed following control mode in Step <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (as opposed to torque following mode). During speed following control mode, the motor/generator applies whatever torque is necessary to achieve a desired speed set point. On the other hand, in torque following mode, the motor/generator tries to achieve the desired torque set point, allowing the speed to change. The motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> remains in speed following control mode until the disconnect clutch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is fully open. Next, a desired angular speed command is also sent to the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at Step <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> based on the desired motor/generator speed <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> After the command for desired motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> speed is sent in Step <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, an actual motor/generator speed <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is received by a vehicle sensor and is compared to the desired motor/generator speed <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at Step <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to produce an motor/generator speed error. The strategy then determines whether an absolute value of the actual motor/generator speed <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> error falls below a calibratable tolerance (Tolerance I) at Step <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. If the speed error is not below Tolerance <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at Step <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the strategy returns to Step <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. If the speed error is below Tolerance <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at Step <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the strategy directs the VSC <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to halt fueling the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at Step <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> based on its own separate stopping strategy and then commands the disconnect clutch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to open at Step <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As the strategy proceeds, the disconnect clutch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> disengages over a calibratable period of time. The engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> speed will begin to decrease. Since the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is in speed following control mode, it will continue to apply whatever torque is necessary (within its capability) to maintain the desired vehicle speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The prediction of a desired motor/generator speed can be a trajectory comparison based on, for example, vehicle velocity and deceleration at a present time and at some past time or on a vehicle acceleration controller (such as an accelerator or brake) position. Predicting the desired motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> speed can also include a determination of whether the vehicle is in speed following control mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The motor/generator gradually takes over the necessary torque to propel the vehicle by proportionally decreasing the actual engine torque in Step <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and Step <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> until engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> torque is zero while maintaining vehicle velocity using, for example, a proportional plus integral controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> At Step <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> the strategy determines whether the disconnect clutch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is disengaged from the vehicle powertrain from a disconnect clutch position sensor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. If the disconnect clutch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is disengaged, the strategy continues. When the disconnect clutch position sensor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> indicates it is disengaged from the powertrain the strategy ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows vehicle speed (velocity) <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (Y-axis) over time <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (X-axis) for desired vehicle speed <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and actual vehicle speed <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Desired vehicle speed <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> can be calculated using vehicle speed and acceleration at the beginning of the engine stop event <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and vehicle speed and acceleration at some past time <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to estimate the vehicle&apos;s velocity at some future time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> An alternative strategy for calculating the desired speed trajectory shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> could instead utilize a map from accelerator or brake position to predict desired vehicle speed, which could then be translated to desired motor/generator speed. As stated above for any implementation, the vehicle brake system status (such as brake position) can still be monitored for any changes so that the overall strategy can be accelerated if the brake is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The above-described embodiment of the invention is provided purely for purposes of example. Many other variations, modifications, and applications of the invention may be made. </paragraph>
