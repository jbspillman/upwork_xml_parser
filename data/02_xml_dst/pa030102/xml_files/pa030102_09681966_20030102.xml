<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), and specifically to a strategy to start an engine in an HEV with minimal torque disturbance to the powertrain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The need to reduce fossil fuel consumption and pollutants from automobiles and other vehicles powered by internal combustion engines (ICEs) is well known. Vehicles powered by electric motors have attempted to address these needs. However, electric vehicles have limited range and limited power coupled with the substantial time needed to recharge their batteries. An alternative solution is to combine both an ICE and electric traction motor into one vehicle. Such vehicles are typically called hybrid electric vehicles (HEV&apos;s). See generally, U.S. Pat. No. 5,343,970 to Severinsky. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The HEV has been described in a variety of configurations. Some HEV patents disclose systems where an operator is required to select between electric and internal combustion operation. In other configurations the electric motor drives one set of wheels and the ICE drives a different set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Other, more useful, configurations have developed. A series hybrid electric vehicle (SHEV) is a vehicle with an engine (most typically an ICE), which powers a generator. The generator, in turn, provides electricity for a battery and motor coupled to the drive wheels of the vehicle. There is no mechanical connection between the engine and the drive wheels. A parallel hybrid electrical vehicle (PHEV) is a vehicle with an engine (most typically an ICE), battery, and electric motor combined to provide torque to power the wheels of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A parallel/series hybrid electric vehicle (PSHEV) has characteristics of both the PHEV and the SHEV. The PSHEV is also known as a torque (or power) splitting powertrain configuration. Here, the torque output of the engine is given in part to the drive wheels and in part to an electrical generator. The generator powers a battery and motor that also provide torque output. In this configuration, torque output can come from either source or both simultaneously. The vehicle braking system can even deliver torque to drive the generator to produce charge to the battery (regenerative braking). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The desirability of combining the ICE with an electric motor is clear. The ICE&apos;s fuel consumption and pollutants are reduced with no appreciable loss of performance or vehicle range. A major benefit of parallel HEV configurations is that the engine can be turned off during periods of low or no power demand from the driver (e.g., waiting for a traffic light). This improves fuel economy by eliminating wasted fuel used during idle conditions. The motor can then propel the vehicle under conditions of low power demand. In some configurations, the engine can be disconnected from the motor and powertrain when it is not running by opening a disconnect clutch. As power demand increases, the engine can be restarted and reconnected to provide the requested torque. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Developing a strategy to start an HEV engine and transfer primary torque production of the powertrain from the motor to the engine with minimal torque disturbance is needed for successful implementation of a parallel HEV. If the engine is disconnected from the powertrain, starting the engine would involve maintaining the vehicle&apos;s response to the driver&apos;s demand using the motor while simultaneously closing a clutch that connects the engine to the powertrain (disconnect clutch) and start running the engine. Torque supply to the powertrain should be transferred from the motor to the engine smoothly in order to avoid any disturbance to the driver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Strategies to turn on an HEV&apos;s engine are known in the prior art. See generally, U.S. Pat. No. 6,054,776 to Sumi; U.S. Pat. No. 6,026,921 to Aoyama et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,865,263 to Yamaguchi, et al. Unfortunately, no strategy is known to start a parallel HEV engine while maintaining a smooth vehicle response to driver demand using the motor while simultaneously closing a clutch that connects the engine to the powertrain (disconnect clutch). </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention provides a strategy to start a parallel HEV engine while maintaining a smooth vehicle response to driver demand using the motor while simultaneously closing a clutch that connects the engine to the powertrain. In the preferred embodiment, the HEV powertrain has an engine, a motor/generator, a power transfer unit (such as an automatic transmission, planetary gear set, or an electronic converterless transmission), and an engine disconnect clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The strategy starts running the engine (based on, for example, driver demand), connects the disconnect clutch to the powertrain, fuels the engine, and predicts a desired motor/generator speed. Next the strategy calculates a desired engine torque. And finally, the strategy gradually reduces actual motor/generator torque while proportionally increasing actual engine torque until motor/generator torque is zero while maintaining vehicle velocity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The prediction of a desired motor/generator speed can be a trajectory comparison based on vehicle velocity and acceleration at a present time and at some past time or on a vehicle accelerator position. Predicting the desired motor/generator speed can also include a determination of whether the vehicle is in speed following control mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The system can also add additional strategies such as a termination the strategy if a vehicle brake is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The gradual reduction of actual motor/generator torque occurs by proportionally increasing actual engine torque until motor/generator torque is zero while maintaining vehicle velocity using, for example, a proportional plus integral controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Other objects of the present invention will become more apparent to persons having ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention pertains from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying figures.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Although the preferred embodiment described is for a parallel HEV, the invention could be applied to any vehicle using a motor and an engine as the drive source having an engine disconnect clutch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows general components of a parallel HEV powertrain with an engine disconnect clutch. An engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is linked to a motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, via a disconnect clutch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The powertrain has a vehicle system controller (VSC) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has an additional motor control unit and inverter (MCU) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A battery <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> connects to the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to allow the flow of electrical current to and from the two components. The motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is connected to a powertrain power transfer unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (such as an automatic transmission, a planetary gear set (power-split), or an electronic converterless transmission), which is connected to the vehicle&apos;s wheels <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, torque and energy flow from the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the power transfer unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to the wheels <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, both the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be directly coupled to the wheels <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, so that both power sources can independently provide torque to the vehicle powertrain. The configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> employs the disconnect clutch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> between the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to allow a temporary disconnection of the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the wheels <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The motor, in addition to propelling the vehicle, can also be operated as a generator for use in charging the battery <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> using the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or through regenerative braking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a strategy to start a parallel HEV engine, while maintaining a smooth vehicle response to driver demand, using the motor/generator and simultaneously closing a clutch that connects the engine to the powertrain. The preferred embodiment of the strategy of the present invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. It is noteworthy at the outset that the strategy can be configured to terminate at any point if a vehicle brake is applied or some other input changes value (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The starting strategy of the present invention begins with a command from the vehicle system controller (VSC) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to enter an engine start mode at Step <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Initially, the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is commanded to run in speed following control mode in Step <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (as opposed to torque following mode). During speed following control mode, the motor/generator applies whatever torque is necessary to achieve the desired speed set point. On the other hand, in torque following mode, the motor/generator tries to achieve the desired torque set point, allowing the speed to change. The motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> remains in speed following control mode for the entire starting event. The desired angular speed command of the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is input to the system at Step <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A desired motor/generator speed <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is based on the overall vehicle operating status and driver demand, and may either be a constant value or a trajectory based on vehicle velocity and acceleration at a present time and at some past time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A strategy for calculating the desired motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> speed is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. If the power transfer unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is not engaged (implying the driver is currently commanding no motive torque), the desired speed is set to the desired engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> idle speed. This can either be calibrated or received as an input signal from an engine controller within the VSC <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. If the power transfer unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is engaged, the desired motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> angular speed (&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>mod</subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight></subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>des</subscript></highlight>) is calculated according to: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>mot</subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight></subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>des</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;&lsqb;v</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>t</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>)&plus;((<highlight><italic>v</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>t</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>)&minus;<highlight><italic>v</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>t</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight>))/<highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight>)*<highlight><italic>kT&rsqb;*C. </italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In this formula: &ldquo;v(t<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>)&rdquo; is the vehicle speed when the engine start mode <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is entered (i.e., at time&equals;&ldquo;t<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;); &ldquo;T&rdquo; is a sample time between measurements of vehicle speed, &ldquo;k&rdquo; is a number of measurement sample intervals since t<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>and &ldquo;C&rdquo; is the kinematic conversion factor from vehicle speed to motor/generator angular speed and can include wheel radius, final drive ratio, and gear ratio. The constant &ldquo;C&rdquo; converts linear vehicle speed at the wheels to angular motor/generator speed. This method effectively uses the vehicle&apos;s velocity and acceleration at the beginning of the engine start event to estimate the vehicle&apos;s velocity at some future time (t<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>)&plus;kT. This basic calculation could be further enhanced to vary the desired motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> angular speed based on, for example, accelerator or brake input from the driver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the specific strategy of the preferred embodiment for the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> speed calculation. The strategy enters a motor/generator speed calculation at Step <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and determines whether the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is in speed following control mode at Step <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. If it is not, a controller timer (not shown) is reset at Step <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and returns the strategy to Step <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to start over. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> If the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is in speed following control mode at Step <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, the &ohgr;<highlight><subscript>mot</subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight></subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>des </subscript></highlight>is calculated as described above at Step <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Once &ohgr;<highlight><subscript>mot</subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight></subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>des </subscript></highlight>is calculated the strategy makes a first determination of whether the power transfer unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (such as a transmission) is engaged at Step <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. If the power transfer unit is engaged, the calculated &ohgr;<highlight><subscript>mot</subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight></subscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>des </subscript></highlight>is used at Step <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and sent by the VSC <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at Step <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. If the power transfer unit is not engaged, an engine idle speed is used at Step <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and sent by the VSC <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at Step <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Once the speed command is sent to the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at Step <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the strategy loops back to Step <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> until the start is finished at Step <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> where the strategy ends. The loop back is needed for the speed command to be continually updated throughout the start event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> An alternative algorithm for calculating the desired speed trajectory shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> could instead utilize a map from accelerator position to desired vehicle speed, which could then be translated to desired motor/generator speed. As stated above for any implementation, brake position can still be monitored for any changes so that the overall strategy can be aborted if the brake is applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a vehicle speed (velocity) <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (Y-axis) over time <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (X-axis) for desired vehicle speed <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and actual vehicle speed <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Desired vehicle speed <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> can be calculated, by way of example only, using vehicle speed and acceleration at the beginning of the engine start event <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and vehicle speed and acceleration at some past time <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to estimate the vehicle&apos;s velocity at some future time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Moving back to the general strategy of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. After the command for desired motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> speed is sent in Step <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, an actual motor/generator speed <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is received from a vehicle sensor (not shown) and is compared to the desired motor/generator speed <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> at Step <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to produce a speed error (Absolute value 1). The strategy then determines whether the Absolute value 1 of the motor/generator speed error of Step <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> falls below a calibratable tolerance (Tolerance I) at Step <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. If the speed error <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is not below Tolerance 1 at Step <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, the strategy returns to Step <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. If the speed error <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is below Tolerance 1 at Step <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, the strategy commands the disconnect clutch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to close at Step <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As the plates of the disconnect clutch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> come together, the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> speed will begin to increase to match the speed of the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Since the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is in speed following control mode, it will continue to apply whatever torque is necessary (within its capability) to maintain the desired speed, even while accelerating the additional load from the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Actual engine speed <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is received from a vehicle sensor (not shown) and is compared to the actual motor/generator speed <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at Step <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to produce a slip speed error (Absolute value 2) as is known in the prior art. This allows actual engine speed <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to be monitored as it approaches the actual motor/generator speed <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at Step <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> (below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The strategy at Step <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> then determines whether the Absolute value 2 of the slip speed error (or difference) of actual engine speed <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and the actual motor/generator speed <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> falls below a calibratable tolerance (Tolerance 2). If the speed error is not below Tolerance 2 at Step <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, the strategy resets Timer 1 at Step <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and returns to Step <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. If the speed error is below Tolerance 2 at Step <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, the strategy commands the Timer 1 to be incremented at Step <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. Once the speed error between the two devices remains below a calibratable tolerance (Tolerance 2) for a calibratable amount of time (Tolerance 3) as indicated by Timer 1, a desired torque command can ultimately be sent to the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. At Step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the strategy determines whether Timer 1 is greater than Tolerance 3. If it is not, the strategy returns to Step <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The next sequence of steps in the strategy transfer motive torque from the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. If Timer 1 is greater than Tolerance 3 at Step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the strategy directs the VSC <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to begin running the engine <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by fueling the engine <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at Step <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> based on its own separate starting algorithm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Next, the strategy next makes a second determination whether the power transfer unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is engaged at Step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This determines the amount of torque command to the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. If the power transfer unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is not engaged (indicating that the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> should be started to idle), a torque command of 0 is sent to the engine at Step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> If the power transfer unit is engaged, (indicating the vehicle is being driven), the strategy attempts to minimize the powertrain disturbance caused during the torque shift from the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In general, the strategy achieves this by basing the desired torque command to the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the actual torque that is being supplied by the motor/generator to maintain the desired velocity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The implementation shown uses a simple proportional plus integral (PI) controller, known in the prior art, to gradually reduce motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> torque to zero by modifying (increasing) an engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> torque setpoint accordingly. Desired engine torque (tq_eng_des) is calculated at Step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> using the PI controller as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>tq</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>eng</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>des&equals;&lsqb;Kp&plus;Ki</italic></highlight>(1<highlight><italic>z</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>)&rsqb;<highlight><italic>tq</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>mot </italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> where Kp and Ki are calibratable proportional and integral controller gains, respectively, and z<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>is a one time step delay. An alternative control algorithm that could be used might involve a feed-forward calculation as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>tq</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>eng</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>des&equals;tq</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>mot&plus;&lsqb;Kp&plus;Ki</italic></highlight>(1<highlight><italic>z</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>)&rsqb;<highlight><italic>tq</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>mot. </italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In general, any other controller that drives motor/generator torque (tq_mot) to zero could be used in place of the PI controller. Actual motor/generator torque <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can be received from a vehicle sensor (not shown) or estimated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Under the influence of the PI controller, the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will begin to provide the increasing torque necessary to maintain the vehicle on the desired speed trajectory while the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provides decreasing torque. The engine start strategy is considered finished once the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is providing all of the torque necessary to propel the vehicle at the desired speed (i.e., motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> torque is zero). This condition is established by determining when the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> torque has remained below a calibratable level (Tolerance 5) and the speed error between the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has remained below a calibratable level (Tolerance 4) for a calibratable amount of time (Tolerance 6). At this point, the engine has been started and is providing the necessary torque to propel the vehicle so the engine start mode is exited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> To reach this point specifically, the strategy makes a determination of whether the engine speed error is less than the Tolerance 4 at Step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> based on the desired engine torque from Step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the Absolute value 2 of the slip speed error of Step <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. If the error is greater than Tolerance 4, Timer 2 is reset at Step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the strategy returns to Step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> until the error is less than Tolerance 4. When this happens, the strategy makes a determination of whether the motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> torque is less than Tolerance 5 at Step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> based on actual motor/generator torque <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. If motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> torque is not less than Tolerance 5, Timer 2 is again reset at Step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the strategy returns to Step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> until the engine <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> speed error is less than Tolerance 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> While motor/generator <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> torque is less than Tolerance 5 at Step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the strategy commands the Timer 2 to be incremented at Step <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Once the speed error and torque conditions (Steps <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>) are continually met for a calibratable duration (Tolerance 6) as determined at Step <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, the engine is determined to be running and providing the full required torque to the powertrain. At this point, the engine has been successfully started and the routine is exited. </paragraph>
