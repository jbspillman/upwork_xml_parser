<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Optical logic gates are constructed from Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) optical circuits. A multi-mode interference (MMI) splitter divides a continuous-wave input into two branches of the interferometer. Each branch has a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). When a logic input having a logic-high power level is applied to one of the SOA&apos;s, cross-phase modulation occurs in the SOA. The phase shift increases through the SOA. The branch coupled to the logic input has a relative phase shift of &pgr; compared with the other branch. When two branches with the &pgr; phase difference are combined, destructive interference occurs, producing a logic low. An MMI combiner or an equivalent phase shifter is used to combine the two branches. The MMI splitter adds a phase shift of &pgr;/2 to the upper branch but not to the lower branch, while the MMI combiner also adds &pgr;/2 shifts. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to all-optical logic elements, and more particularly to the use of interferometers with semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA) and multi-mode interference (MMI) devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Since photons travel faster than electrons, much effort has gone into trying to develop an optical computer or optical logic elements. Different approaches have been taken to developing optical logic and other elements of a computer. Most of these approaches have proven to be difficult to produce, expensive, or bulky. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Optical logic gates are using an interferometer are disclosed by Roberts et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,999,283. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> is a prior-art interferometer-based exclusive-OR (XOR) gate. A continuous-wave light input is split into two branches to semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA) <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Modulated input A is combined with the output of SOA <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, while modulated input B is combined with the output of SOA <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Outputs of SOA <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are combined to produce the logic-gate output C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The logical input signal A combines with the output of SOA <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, either constructively or destructively, depending on the phase difference. Likewise, constructive or destructive interference occurs where input B is combined with the output of SOA <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Finally, constructive or destructive interference occurs where the two interferometer arms are combined to generate the final output C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> SOA <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> have the same phase shift when A and B are at logic 0. The output C is a logical XNOR of A and B. SOA differ in phase shift when A and B are at logic 0 by &pgr;, and output C is the logical XOR of A and B. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> shows the XOR function when the SOA&apos;s have a zero phase difference. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</cross-reference> shows that the interferometer gate is an XNOR gate with a third continuous-wave input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> While useful, the counter-propagation of the logical inputs can feed back to the continuous-wave input, which may cause cross-talk among other gates that share the same continuous-wave signal source. Splitting of the continuous-wave signal power may not be the ideal 50%-50% due to geometry or orientation imperfections of the Y-junctions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The parent application disclosed optical logic gates using semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) configured in a cross-gain modulation (XGM) mode. The parent application uses and multi-mode interference (MMI) splitters/combiners to better control optical power. The inventors realize that phase modulation may be used in place of gain modulation for the optical logic gates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Optical logic gates are desired that employ phase modulation and interferometric techniques with multi-mode interference (MMI) devices for better optical power distribution and control.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an improvement in optical logic gates. The following description is presented to enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention as provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements. Various modifications to the preferred embodiment will be apparent to those with skill in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments. Therefore, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments shown and described, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features herein disclosed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The inventors recognize that arbitrary logic can be constructed from an inverter and a 2-input OR gate, or a 2-input NAND gate. Large optical computers and smaller optical logic and control units could then be feasible. An optical Y-junction can operate like a wired-OR gate in digital-electronic logic. Together, the optical-OR junction and an optical inverter allow for a wide variety of digital logic gates and functions to be implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Rather than use a basic Y-junction, a multi-mode interference (MMI) device acts as a junction, combining two optical input signals to generate one or more optical output signals. MMI devices are also used as optical splitters, and to generate signals with a desired phase difference for different arms of an interferometer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> shows a multi-mode interference (MMI) device. MMI devices are optical directional couplers that use the self-imaging or interferometric properties of a small optical cavity or planar waveguide to pass optical signals from an input opening to one or more output openings. Constructive and destructive interference of the two inputs occurs within the waveguide. The length Z and width W<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>of the waveguide relative to the input wavelength are design parameters. The locations of output openings in the waveguide can be carefully designed to be located at interference maxima. &pgr; is a design parameter that is a function of the waveguide refractive index, free space wavelength and waveguide geometry and is defined in prior art. See L. Soldano, et al, Optical Multi-Mode Interference Devices Based on Self-Imaging: Principle and Applications, journal of Lightwave Technology, Vol., 13, No. 4, April 1995. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The MMI device shown is designed to have a mirror image at the outputs using multi-mode interference of the two inputs <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The two inputs produce two-fold images at the outputs. The output images have the same amplitude, but a quadrature phase difference of &pgr;/2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> An optical signal with a phase shift &PHgr;1 (phi-1) is applied to input <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, while another optical signal with phase shift &phgr;2 is applied to input <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The signal from input <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> passes straight through the MMI device to output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thus output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a &PHgr;1 signal component. Likewise, signal from input <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> passes straight through the MMI device to output <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Thus output <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has a &phgr;2 signal component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The phases &phgr;1, &phgr;2 are relative phases, rather than absolute phases. The MMI device has some phase shift even on the straight paths, so the input phase &phgr;1 is somewhat less than the output phase component &phgr;1. The same is true for the input phase &phgr;2 and &phgr;2 used for calculating the MMI outputs. However, the relative phases or phase difference between &phgr;1 and &phgr;2 at the input to the MMI device is the same phase difference as the &phgr;1, &phgr;2 values used to calculate the MMI outputs. Thus the term phase usually refers herein to relative phases to phase difference, not to absolute phase shifts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The optical inputs can also pass through the MMI device diagonally with an added phase shift of P*&pgr;/2. Thus the signal from input <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> crosses over to output <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, producing a &phgr;1&plus;P &pgr;/2 component, where P is an odd whole number. Likewise, the signal from input <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> crosses over to output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, producing a &phgr;2&plus;P&pgr;/2 component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The signal components at each output can interfere with each other constructively or destructively. For example, when &phgr;1 is out-of-phase with &phgr;2 by 90 degrees (&phgr;2&equals;&phgr;1&plus;&pgr;/2), then at output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the two components are &phgr;1 and &phgr;2&pgr;/2)&equals;(&phgr;1&plus;&pgr;/2&plus;&pgr;/2)&equals;&phgr;1&plus;&pgr;). Since a phase difference of &pgr; (180 degrees) exists between the two components, destructive interference occurs and output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is dark. Output <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has components &phgr;2&equals;(&phgr;1&plus;&pgr;/2) and &phgr;1&plus;&pgr;/2. Since these two components have the same phase, constructive interference occurs and output <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is bright. Analysis is simplified by using the primary mode with P&equals;1, but similar interference occurs for higher-order phase shifts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> When inputs <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> differ in phase by 3&pgr;/2(&phgr;2&equals;&phgr;1&plus;3&pgr;/2), then output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has components &phgr;1 and (&phgr;2&plus;&pgr;/2)&equals;(&phgr;1&plus;3&pgr;/2&plus;&pgr;/2)&equals;(&phgr;1&plus;4&pgr;/2), or components (0, 2&pgr;). The phase difference is 2&pgr;, which is the same as zero, or no phase difference. Constructive interference occurs, and output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is bright. Output <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has components &phgr;2&equals;&phgr;1&plus;3&pgr;/2 and &phgr;1&plus;&pgr;/2, or components (3&pgr;/2, &pgr;/2), which differ by &pgr;, 180 degrees. Destructive interference keeps output <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> dark. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> is a table showing the outputs of the 2&times;2 MMI as a function of various phase differences among the inputs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> shows a 2&times;2 MMI-equivalent optical phase control circuit. The MMI device could be substituted by specific optical shift elements <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> and Y-junctions or other couplers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Relative phase shifts of &pgr;/2 are produced on the path from input <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to output <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and on the path from input <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The MMI device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A and the shift elements of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> are equivalent structures with the same function, both producing the shifts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. Optical shift elements <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> could be another type of SOA processed by lightly doped semiconductor material or any other optical material that could perform a similar function. Thus an equivalent to the MMI device is to use phase shifters with couplers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-D show an optical buffer and inverter using a cross-phase modulation interferometer with SOA and MMI devices. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, MMI splitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has its input <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as a no-connect, while input <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to a continuous-wave optical signal of wavelength &lgr;1. Since there is no signal for &phgr;1, output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> only have the &phgr;2 component. The phase of upper output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is &phgr;2&plus;&pgr;/2, while the phase of lower output <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is &phgr;2. When &phgr;2 is set to zero, output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a phase of &pgr;/2, while output <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a phase of 0. Thus MMI splitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> splits the continuous-wave signal into two branches with a &pgr;/2 phase difference. </paragraph>

The same phase designations are used for all inputs to MMI devices so that the table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> can be used when analyzing these circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Optical logic input A is modulated in power over time, becoming relatively dark to represent a logical 0, and relatively bright to represent a logical 1. Input A is combined with output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of MMI splitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and fed into SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A Y junction can be used to combine these signals.

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> receive a bias current <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, respectively, that adjust the phase shifts through them.

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> However, when input A is a logical 1 (bright), the phase shift through SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> changes. The additional power from input A causes SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to shift the phase of its output. The additional power changes the refractive index of the SOA and thus causes the phase shift. This phase shift causes the upper and lower branches that are applied to inputs <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to no longer have the same phase. A phase difference is introduced by the presence of light on input A. The bias currents <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be adjusted so that when input A is in the logical 1 state, SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shifts phase by an additional 180 degrees (&pgr;). The high power level of input A, and the bias current <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are carefully adjusted to achieve this &pgr; phase shift. </paragraph>

Looking at the table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, when &phgr;1 is &pgr;/2 and &phgr;2 is 0, output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has components (&pgr;/2, &pgr;/2), a phase difference of 0, and so has constructive interference. Thus output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (output C) is a logical 1, and its waveform is high. Output <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (output B) has components (0, &pgr;), a phase difference of &pgr; causing destructive interference, so it is a logical 0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> When input A is high, or in a high-optical power-state with a power level PH, SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is modulated to add a phase difference of &pgr;.

SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> add a phase shift of &pgr; to this, producing a phase of &pgr;/2&plus;&pgr;, or 3&pgr;/2 at the output of SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This phase shift of 3&pgr;/2 is also the phase &phgr;1 of input <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The lower branch through SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a zero relative phase shift, so &phgr;2 on input <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is 0.

Output <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (B) has components (0, 2&pgr;), a phase difference of 2&pgr; or 0, so constructive interference occurs, and output B is at high power, or logic 1.

The truth table and waveforms show that output C is the inverse of A, while output B is the same as A. Thus the optical circuit can be represented as a buffer with input A and output B, and an inverter with input A and output C. An additional input is required, the continuous-wave input CW at wavelength &lgr;1. The input A wavelength &lgr;2 is converted to wavelength &lgr;1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The use of MMI splitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> helps to more easily manage power levels in the circuit.

Having MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> conveniently provides both the true and complement outputs without requiring additional inverter components. By adding power management to a cross-phase modulation (XPM) MZI circuit, input A and outputs B, C can easily be maintained at the same power level. </paragraph>

This OR function includes MMI <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and power-reducing SOA <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. MMI <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is a 2&times;1 MMI with a single output that combines inputs A and B with no relative phase shift. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The combined output of MMI <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is the logical OR of inputs A and B. When either A or B or both A and B are high (bright), the output of MMI <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is also bright (high). When both A and B are dark, the output of MMI <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is dark (low). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Since the power output by MMI <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> could be double the standard high power level when both A and B are high, power-reducing SOA <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is used. Power-reducing SOA <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is biased so that its output power is reduced to about the high power level when either or both A and B are high, but the standard low power level when both A and B are low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The output of power-reducing SOA <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is thus (A OR B). Substituting (A OR B) for A in the truth table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> yields the truth table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. The last 3 rows correspond to the output of power-reducing SOA <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> being high. In that state, SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> produces a phase shift of &pgr; relative to SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Adding the &pgr;/2 phase difference produced by MMI splitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> yields inputs to MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of &phgr;1&equals;3&pgr;/2 and &phgr;2&equals;0. From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (D) has components (3&pgr;/2, &pgr;/2), a phase difference of &pgr;, destructive interference, and is thus low.

Then the inputs to MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are &phgr;1&equals;&pgr;/2 and &phgr;2&equals;0. From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, output <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (D) has components (&pgr;/2, &pgr;/2), a phase difference of 0, constructive interference, and is thus high.

<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</cross-reference> shows that the optical logic of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is equivalent to a NOR gate producing output D, and an OR gate producing output C.

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-C show an optical XOR-XNOR gate using an MMI splitter and combiner. The continuous-wave input is applied to input <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of MMI splitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, resulting in two equal-power optical signals with a &pgr;/2 phase difference. Logical or modulated input A is merged with the upper path with the &pgr;/2 phase shift and input to SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, while logic input B is merged with the lower path with the 0 phase shift and input to SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Optical signals A, B have wavelength &lgr;2, which is removed from both the upper and lower paths by filters <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> When A and B are both logic 0 (dark), the upper and lower SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> have the same relative phase shift, 0 due to their biasing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The upper path to &phgr;1 has a phase shift of &pgr;/2, while the lower path to &phgr;2 has 0 relative phase shift. From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, when the inputs to MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are &pgr;/2, 0, the outputs are logic 1 for the upper output D and logic 0 for the lower output C.

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> When input A is 1 (bright) and input B is 0 (dark), the added power to SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> causes an additional phase shift of &pgr; through SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> relative to SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The phase shift in the upper path is &pgr;/2 from MMI splitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and &pgr; from SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, so &phgr;1 is 3&pgr;/2. The lower-path phase shift is 0, so &phgr;2 is 0. From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, when the inputs to MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are 3&pgr;/2, 0, the outputs are logic 0 for the upper output D and logic 1 for the lower output C.

<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> When input A is 0 (dark) while input B is 1 (lit), the added power to SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> causes an additional phase shift of &pgr; through SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> relative to SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The phase shift in the upper path is &pgr;/2 from MMI splitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and &pgr; from SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, so &phgr;1 is &pgr;/2. The lower-path phase shift is 0 from MMI splitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and &pgr; from SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so &phgr;2 is &pgr;. From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, when the inputs to MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are &pgr;/2, &pgr;, the outputs are logic 0 for the upper output D and logic 1 for the lower output C. This is shown in the second row of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> When both inputs A, B are lit (logic 1), both of SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> have an added phase shift of &pgr; due to the increased power from the logic inputs A, B. The upper path has a phase shift of &pgr;/2 from MMI splitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and &pgr; from SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, for a total of 3&pgr;/2 for &phgr;1, while the lower path has relative phase shift of &pgr; due to SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference> shows that the optical circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> can be represented as an XOR gate producing C and an XNOR gate producing D from inputs A, B and the continuous-wave input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A-C show an AND gate using an interferometer with SOA and MMI devices but without a continuous-wave input. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>A, modulated logic input B replaces the continuous-wave input CW of the inverter-buffer of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, and output C is moved to the lower output of MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> where output D was. Thus, when input B is high (logic 1), the circuit operates as a non-inverting buffer to output C, buffering input A as described for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. This is seen in the second and fourth rows of the truth table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>B, where B is 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> When logic input B is 0 (dark), the absence of an optical signal (or a signal of very low power) causes the lower path from MMI splitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to be dark. Thus &phgr;2 to MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is not present. The only optical signal is from input A, which has a wavelength of &lgr;2. Filter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> blocks this wavelength, so no optical signal from input A can reach the upper input to MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Since both inputs to MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are dark, its outputs are also dark. Thus when input B is dark, output C must also be dark. This is shown in the first and third rows of the truth table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</cross-reference>. The phases &phgr;1, &phgr;2 of the inputs to MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are both 0, but the absence of an optical signal of sufficient power keeps the outputs dark, which is a logical 0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</cross-reference> shows that the optical circuit is a AND gate producing C from inputs A and B. No continuous-wave is needed. The inputs have difference wavelengths: input A has wavelength &lgr;2, while input B and output C have wavelength &lgr;1. Having difference wavelengths for the inputs can be a disadvantage in some applications, but may be acceptable in other applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Another disadvantage is a power management issue. In this AND optical logic, in order to keep the input and output at about same power level, input B is at 2*PH and input A is at 1*PH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In some applications, input B can be used as a control input and A as a signal input. Then output C has the about same power level PH. The counter-propagate method can be used for input A, injecting the power from right hand side of SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The same wavelength can be used for input A and input B and also eliminate using a filter. But the disadvantage is that the input A could disturb the input B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an optical XOR-XNOR gate with separate phase shifters to better adjust relative phase shifts and gains. The biasing currents <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to SOA <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> must be carefully pre-selected to ensure that SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> have the same phase shift when logic inputs A, B are dark, but an added relative phase shift of &pgr; when the logic input to an SOA is bright, or at the pre-determined high optical power level. When both A and B are lit, SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> again need to have the same relative phase shift, even through the added optical power increases the absolute phase shift in each SOA. This can be a challenging design goal, especially for more complex logic gates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The CW input can have a 2*PH CW, so that output C or output D has an optical power of 1*PH. Two criteria should be maintained. One criteria is the relative phase shift &pgr; (or no phase shift) created on the end of upper and lower arms. The second criteria is to keep the same optical power on the end of upper and lower branches or arms. With the same gain or same optical power on input <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and input <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of MMI <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, or 1*PH on end of each arms, input <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> distributes 0.5&times;PH optical power to output D and C respectively. Input <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also distributes 0.5&times;PH optical power to output C and D respectively. Therefore the last stage 3 dB 2&times;2 MMI could have one output constructively restore power to 1*PH and another output port destructively reduce power to 0. For better control phase and gain, the SOAs can be separated into two sections: phase control and gain control. Usually the phase control SOA can be made from a lightly-doped-material SOA or some optical shift element that performs the same function. The gain-control SOA can be made by a heavily-doped-material SOA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> M is-matches in the upper and lower paths can add phase shifts beyond the shifts created by SOA&apos;s <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For example, waveguides or fiber channels connecting MMI splitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, SOA&apos;s <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, filters <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, and MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may have slightly different lengths, indexes of refraction, reflections, or other variances that can change phase. The phase may also depend on the wavelength and vary between &lgr;1 and &lgr;2. While the bias currents can be adjusted to compensate for these variations, each manufactured logic gate may have to be separately measured to determine the bias currents for that particular device. When input A and input B are at different power levels, one at logic 0 and the other at logic 1, the extra gain created from inputs A and B for wavelength &lgr;2 are blocked by the filter. Therefore, the optical wave reaching port 1 and port 2 of 3 dB 2&times;2 MMI <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> combine to have about the same power level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Phase shifters <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are added to allow more flexible adjustment of the phase shifts in the two paths of the interferometer. The phase of the upper arm can be adjusted through bias current I<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and by bias IP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to phase shifter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the phase of the lower arm can be adjusted through bias current I<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and by bias IP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to phase shifter <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Since up to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> adjustments can be made, better matching of the phase shifts to the targets can occur. Phase shifters <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> could have a coarser or a finer dependence on the bias, allowing for both coarse and fine adjustments to be made. Phase shifter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> does not have to be extra components. The SOA can be separated into two sections. Phase shifter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be a lightly-doped region of SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> created by an ion implanter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows an optical XOR-XNOR gate with an integrated phase-gain shifters to adjust relative phase shifts. Rather than have separate phase shifters in each arm of the interferometer, the SOA devices can be replaced with a more complex SOA. Phase and gain adjustable SOA <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has at least two bias controls: bias IG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> controls the SOA gain, while bias IP<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> controls the phase shift. Likewise, phase and gain adjustable SOA <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has bias controls IG<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the SOA gain, and IP<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the phase shift. The separate gain control is useful for better adjusting optical power levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a counter-propagate optical logic gate using an interferometer with MMI devices. Rather than have all logic signals propagate in the same direction as the continuous-wave input (co-propagation), the logical inputs can be introduced into the logic circuit in the reverse direction. This has the advantage of eliminating the filters, and all inputs and outputs can have the same wavelength &lgr;1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The disadvantage of this structure is the logic input could disturb the input CW. If the CW is an outside laser source there may be no problem, as an individual laser source might have an isolated device to block any incoming optical power and to prevent potential damage to the laser source. However, the problem may be more serious for integrated optics that have the CW laser source built into a single chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> To overcome this problem, isolator or circulator <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> can be included between the CW input source and MMI splitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Any optical signal of wavelength &lgr;1 propagating in the reverse direction from MMI splitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is removed by circulator <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> MMI splitter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> splits the continuous-wave input into two equal-power signals for the upper and lower branches of the interferometer. The upper signal to phase and gain adjustable SOA <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has a phase shift of &pgr;/2 relative to the 0 phase shift for the lower signal to phase and gain adjustable SOA <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The modulated optical inputs A, B are introduced to the output side of SOA&apos;s <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, so that their signals travel in an opposite direction to that of the continuous-wave signal. However, cross-phase modulation within SOA&apos;s <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> still occurs as the two optical signals interact with the SOA cavity medium. When signal A is lit, the additional optical power in SOA <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> causes an added phase shift of &pgr; to the continuous-wave signal, resulting in the output of SOA <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> having a total relative shift of 3&pgr;/2. Thus upper input <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has &phgr;1&equals;3&pgr;/2 when A is lit, but is &pgr;/2 when A is dark. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Likewise, when signal B is lit, the additional optical power in SOA <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> causes an added phase shift of &pgr; to the continuous-wave signal in the lower path, resulting in the output of SOA <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> having a total relative shift of &pgr;. Thus lower input <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has &phgr;2&equals;&pgr; when B is lit, but is 0 when B is dark. This is the same relative phase shift as shown in the truth table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, which yields a XOR function to C and an XNOR function to output D. Other logic gates such as NOR, AND, etc. can also be implemented in the counter-propagate mode rather than the co-propagate mode shown earlier. </paragraph>

When A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are both dark, all inputs to the circuit are dark and so outputs B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> must also be dark. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> When A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is dark but A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is bright (1), the upper arm to SOA <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has a phase shift of &pgr;/2 relative to the 0 phase shift of the lower arm to SOA <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Since SOA <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> have the same phase shift, the relative phases input to MMI combiner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are &phgr;1&equals;&pgr;/2 and &phgr;2&equals;0. From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the upper output B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is 1 while the lower output B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 0.

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> When control input C is bright (logic 1), then additional optical power is applied to SOA <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> This additional power causes an added phase shift of &pgr; in SOA <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> relative to SOA <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> When both inputs A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are dark, the only light is from input C at wavelength &lgr;2, which is blocked by filter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Optical switch <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can also be used with fewer than all data inputs and outputs. For example, one of the outputs can be a no-connect, producing a 2&times;1 switch. When only one data input (A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) is connected, and the other is kept dark, both outputs can be used, producing a 1&times;2 switch. When only one input (A<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and one output (B<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are connected, optical switch <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can operate as a 1&times;1 switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A-B show an optical NOR gate with a power-restoring SOA and MMI phase-shift devices. For some embodiments, the MMI splitter and combiners can be replaced with Y-junctions. The lack of the MMI splitter causes SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to each receive the continuous-wave input with the same phase, or zero phase difference among the two branches of the interferometer. Another Y-junction replaces the MMI combiner to produce the final output C after filter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> removes wavelength &lgr;2. Using a Y-junction instead of an MMI device, only 1*PH power is needed for CW. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The logical inputs A and B are combined by MMI <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, a 2&times;1 MMI device. The combined output from MMI <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> or just a Y-junction coupler is applied to power-reducing SOA <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> When A and B are both 0 (dark), SOA <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> outputs little or no power to SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives no significant signal from SOA <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, it has about the same phase shift as SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, so that the upper and lower paths have a near-zero phase difference. Constructive interference occurs as the combining Y-junction, producing a bright (logic 1) output C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> When either or both of inputs A, B are lit, SOA <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> outputs a signal with significant optical power to SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The phase shift of SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> changes or is modulated, so that the upper path has a phase shift of &pgr; relative to the lower path. Destructive interference occurs at the combining Y-junction, producing a dark output C. Thus the optical circuit is a NOR function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</cross-reference> highlights that output C is the NOR of inputs A, B, but has the same wavelength X <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as the continuous-wave input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> When both inputs A, B are high, power-reducing SOA <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> acts to reduce the optical power level. The power level of the output of power-reducing SOA <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is kept to near the target power level for the logic high state. SOA <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is biased so that its output is near the high power level whether one or both of the A, B inputs are high. Such power-restoring SOA&apos;s are described more fully in the parent application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be replaced by other devices, or even eliminated altogether. When the absolute phase shift through SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is small, SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> could be replaced by a fiber waveguide or other material with about the same phase shift as SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Then the bias <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could be adjusted to match the phase shifts in the upper and lower paths so that a zero relative phase shift occurs when SOA <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> outputs a dark signal, but the two paths have a phase difference when SOA <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> outputs a high optical signal to SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Of course, inclusion of SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provides better matching of phase shifts in the two paths, and more flexibility in biasing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A-B show an interferometer-based optical NAND gate with a power-increasing SOA. The power level of the input continuous-wave signal CW is doubled from the high power level PH to 2&times;PH by power-increasing SOA <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The boosted power continuous-wave signal is split by 1&times;4 MMI splitter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> into four paths. Each path has a continuous-wave signal with half the high level, or 0.5&times;PH. All four outputs from MMI splitter <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> have the same phase shift, or a relative phase of 0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> When inputs A and B are both dark, SOA&apos;s <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> have unity gain and equal phase shifts, so that no phase difference occur among the four branches. The outputs of SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are combined by a Y-junction and any signal from input A at wavelength &lgr;2 is blocked by filter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> before being applied to the upper input of 2&times;1 MMI combiner <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. For the lower two branches, the outputs of SOA <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are combined by another Y-junction and any signal from input B at wavelength &lgr;2 is blocked by filter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> before being applied to the lower input of MMI combiner <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. MMI combiner <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> combines these signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Since each signal has an optical power of about 0.5&times;PH, the total signal power after MMI combiner <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is 2&times;PH. Power-reducing SOA <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> reduces the power from 2&times;PH to PH to restore the logic-high power level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> When input A is high, the additional optical power input to SOA <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> causes an added phase shift of &pgr; in the upper branch relative to the second branch through SOA <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The phase difference of &pgr; causes destructive interference at the upper Y-junction, resulting in a dark signal being applied to the upper input of MMI combiner <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. MMI combiner <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> then simply passes through the signal at its lower input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> When input B is high, the additional power into SOA <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> causes an added phase shift of &pgr; through the fourth branch relative to the third branch through SOA <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The phase difference of &pgr; causes destructive interference at the lower Y junction. A dark signal is applied to the lower input of MMI combiner <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. When A is also high, the upper input to MMI combiner <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is also dark, so MMI combiner <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> outputs a dark signal to power-reducing SOA <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Output C is then dark (low). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> When B is high but A is low, SOA <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> has the added phase shift of &pgr; while SOA <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> has no added phase shift. Destructive interference occurs for the lower Y-junction, but constructive interference for the upper Y junction. The upper input to MMI combiner <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has a power of PH, while the lower input is dark. MMI combiner <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> then outputs a signal with power PH to power-reducing SOA <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> of the parent application, the design of the SOA provides a gain of 0 dB for a 1&times;PH-level power input. Thus output C of power-restoring SOA <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> sustains the PH power level. Hence, output C obtains logic 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference> shows that the circuit is equivalent to a NAND gate with inputs A, B and output is. C. The continuous-wave input and output C have the same wavelength &lgr;1, while the logic inputs A, B have wavelength &lgr;2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Alternate Embodiments </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Several other embodiments are contemplated by the inventors. For example, larger MMI devices could be used, and logic gates with more inputs produced. Even larger, more complex logic functions with multiple inputs are contemplated, such as AND-OR networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA&apos;s) can be constructed from a variety of materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Rather than use an electrical bias current to the SOA&apos;s, an optical pump bias could be used, or some other energy-adding method. The SOA&apos;s or phase shifters could also operate with a phase shift that is normally &pgr;, or some other value, rather than normally 0, in the absence of optical power from the logic input signal. The bias could be fixed into the SOA&apos;s or the branches. The relative phase shifts of the two SOA&apos;s could also be set to differ in the absence of optical power from logic input signal. The MMI&apos;s could vary in design and have diagonal phase shifts other than &pgr;/2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> While the phase differences among the two SOA&apos;s has been described, a person with skill in the art will realize that the phase shift differences among the two paths in the interferometer are critical, not just the phase shifts of the SOA&apos;s. Phase shifts can advance phase or delay phase. However, the primary phase difference is due to the SOA&apos;s, so the phase difference is simply referred to as being caused by the SOA&apos;s to simplify the explanations. When the paths add significant phase differences, the path differences can be compensated by additional biasing of the SOA&apos;s to make the phase shift of the upper path match the phase shift of the lower path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> One benefit of using semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) for optical inverters is that SOA&apos;s are inherently amplifying devices. Power levels are restored or boosted by the optical inverters, compensating for any losses. Thus the optical logic using optical inverters is self-restoring. The power levels of the inputs to the optical inverters can be adjusted to vary the amplification, and the SOA&apos;s themselves may be modified or optimized in a variety of ways to adjust amplification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> An optical input wave-guide can be an optical fiber, such as a strand of a fiber-optic cable, or a guide formed on a substrate, such as a groove or a transparent layer formed on the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Rather than be completely dark when the modulated input or output is low, the optical power may be low but still somewhat present. The low optical power can be detected as a low if the optical power is below a threshold of a sensor. The optical inverter can still be useful even when the output is still somewhat on for logic 0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Power management is a consideration. Both fan-in and fan-out should be considered for power matching. When an output is going to drive several inputs, such as <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> downstream inputs, then the output needs to use an SOA that increases power by <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> before sending the output to the downstream optical inputs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Multiple outputs can be provided on the SOA&apos;s and MMI devices to save logic gates at the cost of more power. Alternatively, only one output could be provided at the cost of more logic gates to provide for more outputs but at less power. </paragraph>
