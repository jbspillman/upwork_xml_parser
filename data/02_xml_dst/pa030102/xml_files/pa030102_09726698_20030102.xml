<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to systems and methods for recording and processing time series data, i.e., numeric data that are recorded in time sequence, and particularly to a system and method for predicting an extreme change in a time series given past given past values of the series using symbol extraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One problem that often arises when recording and processing time series data is that the numeric data are too noisy. Noise can be due to measurement error of the time series, or due to process noise which arises in situations where the data that are measured are subject to shocks due to the data generation process. For example, in a stock market scenario, where a future stock value (of a time series) is to be predicted given past values of the series, each stock price at a given time is due to the impact of every trader on the market. Thus, it is said that the measurements are due to process noise. In these events, it is necessary to invoke &ldquo;noise reduction strategies,&rdquo; i.e., methods to reduce the noise present in the observations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Signal processing technology is replete with numerous noise reduction techniques. The following references: Scharf, et. al. entitled L.L. Scharf, Statistical Signal Processing: Detection, Estimation, and Time Series Analysis (New York: Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1990); L.L. Scharf, &ldquo;The SVD and Reduced Rank Signal Processing,&rdquo; Chapter 1 in The SVD and its Applications, R. Vaccaro, ed. (Elsevier, 1991); and, &ldquo;Digital Signal Processing,&rdquo; by Richard A. Roberts, Clifford T. Mullis(Contributor). Hardcover (February 1987) outline some of the well-known noise reduction strategies. One particular signal processing noise reduction technique is known as singular value decomposition as described in the reference to C.R. Rao entitled &ldquo;Linear Statistical Analysis and its Applications&rdquo; (1963). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another method for processing time series signals, in particular, utilizes moving average techniques to reduce noise. Moving averages are computed by taking subsets of sequences of numbers, computing the average of those numbers, recording the result, and then shifting the subset by one unit in time. Other noise reduction techniques include the application of a digital filter. Essentially, most of the noise reduction techniques rely on moving averages of the data, which do not generate symbol sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It would be highly desirable to provide an improved method and mechanism for forcasting future time series values, and particularly, extreme events, based on past time series data values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It would additionally be highly desirable to provide an improved method for processing time series signals in which a time series is converted to a symbol sequence comprising sets of finite symbols which may be used as a basis for forcasting future time series values. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to the principles of the invention, assuming that a large time-series of data is received having values in which a sharp (extreme) change is exhibited, the system of the present invention includes steps for: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> (1) extracting a window of the time series that immediately precedes each sharp change; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> (2) building a matrix of these time series extracts by placing each time series vector in row-major order; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> (3) performing singular value decomposition on this matrix; and, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> (4) using the resulting characteristic vectors as the symbols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, a sharp (extreme) change is defined as being a change of 30% in the time series over 10 units of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> More particularly, the symbol extraction algorithm is as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Given a finite time series of length T with values denoted as y(t), with N extreme changes at time steps &lcub;k(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), k(<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) , . . , k(N)&rcub;; then, choose a window size W and compute the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> a) Set j&equals;1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> b) Let x(j)&equals;&lsqb;y(k(<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)&minus;W), y(k(<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)&minus;W) , . . . , y(W)&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> c) Let X&equals;&lsqb;X;x(j)&rsqb;; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> d) Repeat until j&equals;N </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A typical value is W&equals;25, however, as known to skilled artisans, is dependent upon the application. When the steps a)-d) are performed, the result is a matrix X, (N&times;W matrix). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The next step involves computing the well known singular value decomposition (&ldquo;svd&rdquo;) of the resulting matrix X. That is: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> e) perform svd(X)&equals;&lsqb;U, S, V&rsqb;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Specifically, given matrix X, the well known mathematical transformation X&equals;U S V<highlight><superscript>T </superscript></highlight>is performed where S is a diagonal (N &times;W) matrix and U and V are the characteristic orthogonal matrices such that U is an N&times;N matrix and V is an W&times;W matrix. As known, the columns of the matrix U are the left singular vectors of the matrix A and the column space of the matrix V (or the row space of V<highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>) are the right singular vectors of the matrix A; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to the preferred embodiment of the invention, the symbols to be used for subsequent forecasting are held in the matrix V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> When a new time series arrives, sequential windows of the series are taken. A computation is then performed to take a normalized dot-product against the characteristic vectors. These scores (the normalized dot-product) become the new time series. It is the case that the resultant scores have a better signal to noise ratio, and therefore can be used to make a prediction of whether or not the extreme change is going to occur in the time series. More particularly, the forecasting technique on the new series is as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> f) receive a new time series z(t); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> g) generate windows of length W in the new time series; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> h) compute the dot product of the windows against a predetermined number of columns of characteristic matrix V; and, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> i) perform forecasting on the new series. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It has been experimentally determined that the predetermined number of columns of the characteristic matrix V in which the dot product is computed is the first five (5) columns. In theory, it may be any number between 1 and W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> An example application of the present invention is now provided: In the example, the closing prices of stocks from a well known stock index (Russell 2000) for a particular year were gathered. This amounted to a time series of stocks corresponding to about 255 days of data for 2000 stocks. For each of the time series, there is calculated another time series that indicates the degree of extreme behavior that the time series exhibits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Given a time series y(t), the extreme behavior signal is calculated as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>e(t)&equals;(y(t&minus;M)&minus;y(t))/y(t&minus;M) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Thus, if for a given value of t, e(t)&equals;0.3, that means that the value of the time series y(t) changed by 30% in M time units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Any time the signal e(t) crosses the threshold of 0.3, this is characterized as an extreme change. Note: the term &lsquo;disaster&rsquo; and extreme behavior are used herein interchangably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Whenever the extreme behavior signal crosses the threshold of 0.3 (or equivalently 30%), the price data that precedes it for the last 20 days (e.g., W&equals;20, in this case) is extracted. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) illustrates a disaster indication 50 for a company with ticker XXXX. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) illustrates the extreme behavior signal e(t) indicating variations in stock price as compared to the 30% disaster threshold <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The location of the disaster is indicated in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) by arrow A. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) there is illustrated the company XXXX price data signal y(t) for the example year and indicating the time window W that precedes the day when the threshold had been exceeded. According to this example, this data 75 is gathered for the prior 20 days (W&equals;20). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> After going through all 2000 stocks, an extreme events library in the form of a matrix X is formed. Each row of the matrix X corresponds to the W values of the time series that precede an extreme event. Thus, if the total number of extreme events is N, the size of the matrix X is N&times;W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The decomposition is performed using the standard algorithm for singular value decomposition. New matrices U, S, and V are returned according to the equation: X&equals;USV* The symbols reside in the columns of matrix V*. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the first six (6) &ldquo;extreme event&rdquo; symbols <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> that are derived for the stock index for that particular year according to the invention. Once the extreme event symbols are generated, a search is conducted for those symbols in another time series. Thus, if there is a window in time where the time series includes those symbols, it is likely that an extreme event will occur. Thus, the next step includes mapping new signals onto the extreme event signals: For example, if it is desired to predict extreme events for the Russell 200 stock index for the next year, the following steps are performed: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> 1. Choose a time series; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> 2. Extract a window of length W; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> 3. Take the dot product (vector product) between the time series and the symbols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> 4. Implement a classifier to determine whether the values returned from the dot product are predictive of an extreme event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> If the values are close enough, it is likely that an &ldquo;extreme event&rdquo; may occur with high probability within the next M time units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been particularly shown and described with respect to illustrative and preformed embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention which should be limited only by the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
