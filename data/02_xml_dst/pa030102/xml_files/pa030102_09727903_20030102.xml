<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a sub-harmonic generator for producing a synthesized signal derived from an input signal but including energy levels at frequencies not contained in the input signal, and the present invention also relates to an expansion processor for increasing the stereo width produced by signals from left and right channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Conventional sub-harmonic generators are used to modify an input signal to produce a sub-harmonic signal having at least some desirable characteristics. In music reproduction/processing contexts, an input signal may include frequency components taken from an audible range of about 20 Hz to about 20,000 Hz. The conventional sub-harmonic generator produces an output signal that includes energy at substantially all of the frequency components of the input signal plus additional energy at frequency components in a sub-harmonic range. In some cases, the output signal includes energy at only a subset of the frequency components of the input signal (such as a sub-woofer range) plus the additional energy in the sub-harmonic range. Usually, a range of frequency components from the input signal are utilized to derive the frequency components in the sub-harmonic range, and the input signal is augmented with the frequency components in the sub-harmonic range to obtain the output signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In theory, these conventional sub-harmonic generators produce desirable characteristics in the output signal, such as increased signal energy in the sub-harmonic range, thereby producing a richer base response when converted into audible sound energy. In practice, however, the audible characteristics of the output signal from conventional sub-harmonic generators suffer from a number of disadvantages, namely (i) a relatively flat (or &ldquo;cardboard&rdquo;) audible sound is obtained from the output signal due primarily to the increase in energy from sub-harmonic frequency components without modifying other frequency characteristics of the input signal, this disadvantage may also manifest in a &ldquo;rumbly&rdquo; sound depending on the frequency content of the input signal; and (ii) the audible sound exhibits poor &ldquo;attack&rdquo; and &ldquo;decay&rdquo; characteristics due to an inability by the sub-harmonic generator to accurately reflect an amplitude envelope of the input signal as a function of the frequency components of interest. Thus, the energy of the output signal in the sub-harmonic frequency range does not exhibit desirable amplitude characteristics. In addition, conventional sub-harmonic generators have not effectively utilized sub-harmonic signals in stereo applications, particularly where maintaining stereo &ldquo;width&rdquo; is of importance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It would be desirable to obtain a new sub-harmonic generator that avoids flat, cardboard sounding characteristics in an output signal by modifying frequency components at least partially outside the sub-harmonic range. It would also be desirable to obtain a sub-harmonic generator that exhibits superior attack and decay characteristics, preferably by using the amplitude envelope of the input signal (as a function of frequency components in the relevant frequency range) in producing the output signal. It is also desirable to obtain an expansion processor for increasing stereo width characteristics created by signals from left and right channels, particularly where sound clarity is improved above certain frequencies. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings wherein like numerals indicate like elements, there is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1 a</cross-reference> block diagram of a sub-harmonic generator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in accordance with one or more aspects of the present invention. The sub-harmonic generator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a band-pass filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a signal divider circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, a wave shaping filter <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, a voltage controlled amplifier <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, and an RMS detector <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Alternative embodiments of the sub-harmonic generator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may also include a limiter <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, a summation circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and/or a low pass filter <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Still further embodiments of the sub-harmonic generator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may also include a sub-harmonic enhancement circuit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which preferably includes at least one band-pass filter <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, an amplifier <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and a summation circuit <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The band-pass filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is preferably operable to receive an input signal containing frequencies from among a first range and to produce a first intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> containing frequencies from among a second range. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the input signal may contain audible frequency components, for example, from among frequencies between about 20 Hz and about 20,000 Hz. It is understood that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is given by way of illustration only and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention (e.g., the input signal may contain frequencies outside the audible frequency range and still be considered within the scope of the invention). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the second range of frequencies preferably falls within the first range of frequencies, and in the case of an audible input signal (such as music) the second range most preferably falls at a low end of the first range. Although the invention is not limited by any theory of operation, it has been found through experimentation that a second range of frequencies extending from about 40 Hz to about 110 Hz is desirable when the input signal contains audible frequencies, such as music. It has also been found through experimentation that a second range extending from about 56 Hz to about 96 Hz works particularly well when the sub-harmonic generator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is employed to modify an audible input signal for increasing listening pleasure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The band-pass filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be implemented using any of the known circuit techniques. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the band-pass filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> preferably is implemented utilizing a cascaded low pass filter <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and high pass filter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to produce the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The low pass filter <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be implemented by way of active circuitry (as shown) or by way of passive circuitry and may include single or multiple poles as may be desired. It is most preferred that the low pass filter <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a first corner frequency substantially at an upper end of the second range of frequencies (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>), such as at 96 Hz. Preferably, a low pass signal is obtained on node <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> that contains frequencies substantially at or below the first corner frequency, such as 96 Hz. As will be discussed in more detail hereinbelow, the low pass signal on node <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may be utilized to produce a sub-woofer signal. The high pass filter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may also be implemented using active circuitry (as shown) or passive circuitry and may include a single or multiple poles may be desired. It is preferred that the high pass filter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> includes a second corner frequency, below the first corner frequency of the low pass filter <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, substantially at a lower end of the second range of frequencies (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>), such as at 56 Hz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the low pass filter <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and high pass filter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> would not exhibit &ldquo;brick wall&rdquo; transfer characteristics as is illustrated by the second range shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>; indeed, a practical band-pass filter exhibits a gradual transition in gain characteristics through the pass band and other frequencies of interest. Thus, the brick wall representations shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>B (and FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>C-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>E for that matter) are utilized for the sake of clarity, e.g., to illustrate the frequency interrelationships between respective ranges. In a practical circuit, however, the first range, second range, etc. will probably exhibit gradual transitions in gain through frequencies of interest. Consequently, a determination as to whether a frequency is &ldquo;within&rdquo; or &ldquo;outside&rdquo; a particular range illustrated is intended to be made with the understanding that gradual attenuation may be obtained at frequencies near corner frequencies of the band-pass filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (and the other filters discussed hereinbelow). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the signal divider circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is preferably operable to receive the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and to produce a square wave signal on node <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, where the square wave signal contains square wave signal components at frequencies about one octave below the second range of frequencies. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, the square wave signal components preferably include frequencies from among a third range of frequencies that are about one octave below the second range of frequencies. Thus, when the second range of frequencies extends from about 40 Hz to about 110 Hz, the third range of frequencies preferably extends from about 20 Hz to about 55 Hz. It has been found through experimentation that particularly advantageous and pleasing listening results are obtained when the third range of frequencies extends from about 28 Hz to about 48 Hz. It is noted that the square wave signal on node <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> will include signal energy at fundamental frequencies substantially within the third range of frequencies and harmonic frequencies substantially outside the third range of frequencies. For simplicity, however, the third range of frequencies illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> shows only the fundamental frequency components and omits the harmonic frequency components of the square wave signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the signal divider circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> includes a zero crossing detector <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and a frequency divider circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The zero crossing detector <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is preferably operable to produce a zero crossing signal on node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> that transitions each time the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> substantially matches a reference potential. Any of the known circuit implementations for carrying out the functions of the zero crossing detector <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be used and are considered within the scope of the invention. For example, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> detailed schematic of a zero crossing detector <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is illustrated. The zero crossing detector <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> preferably includes a comparator <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> operable to compare respective amplitudes of a reference potential on node <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. It is noted that the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> preferably passes through an amplifier/buffer stage to produce a similar intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>A, although this stage is not required to carry out the invention. The zero crossing signal on node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> transitions from high-to-low or low-to-high each time the amplitude of the reference potential on node <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> substantially equals the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>A. The &ldquo;high&rdquo; and &ldquo;low&rdquo; levels are a function of the specific circuit implementation. Here, the high level is about 15 V and the low level is about 0 V (or ground potential). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The zero crossing detector circuit <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> preferably includes a hysteresis circuit operable to adjust the amplitude of the reference potential on node <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> each time the zero crossing signal on node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> transitions from high-to-low or low-to-high. By way of example, a resistor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is coupled from node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to an input terminal (here, the noninverting input terminal) of the comparator circuit <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, which is also node <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Thus, each time the zero crossing signal on node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> transitions, more or less voltage amplitude is induced on node <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, thereby adjusting the reference potential. The hysteresis prevents undesirable oscillations in the zero crossing signal on node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and also tends to eliminate beat frequency signal components that may be present in the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, the frequency divider circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is preferably operable to receive the zero crossing signal on node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and to produce the square wave signal on node <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> such that the square wave signal transitions once each time the zero crossing signal transitions twice. Any of the known circuit implementations for carrying out the function of the frequency divider circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be employed. Preferably, the frequency divider circuit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is implemented using a flip-flop circuit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, such as an edge sensitive flip-flop or a level sensitive flip-flop. The zero crossing signal on node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is coupled to a clock terminal (node <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>) of the flip-flop circuit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. An amplitude limiting circuit employing a resistor, zenor diode, and capacitor are employed to ensure that the amplitude of the zero crossing circuit on node <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> does not damage the flip-flop circuit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The square wave signal on node <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> will transition once each time the zero crossing signal on node <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> transitions twice. This advantageously results in a square wave signal on node <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> that contains fundamental frequencies within the third range of frequencies (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>). While the square wave signal on node <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> contains fundamental square wave frequencies in the third range (i.e., the sub-harmonic frequency range), it also contains undesirable harmonic frequencies outside the third range due to the harsh transitions of the square wave created by the flip-flop circuit <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The square wave signal transitions between high and low values (e.g., 5 V and 0 V), and, therefore does not contain any information concerning the amplitude envelope of the input signal at frequencies of interest, e.g., in the second range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Turning again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the wave shaping filter <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is preferably operable to receive the square wave signal on node <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and to attenuate frequencies substantially outside the third range of frequencies and to produce an intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that contains sinusoidal frequency components at frequencies corresponding substantially to the fundamental frequency components of the square wave signal on node <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Thus, the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> contains energy at frequencies from among the third range (e.g., the sub-harmonic range) without substantial energy at frequencies outside the third range. Any of the known circuit implementations capable of carrying out the function of the wave shaping filter <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be employed. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it is preferred that the wave shaping filter <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of band-pass filters, each receiving the square wave signal on node <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and having a respective center frequency such that a sum of outputs of the band-pass filters substantially exclude frequencies outside the third range. Most preferably, the wave shaping filter <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> includes a first band-pass filter <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and a second band-pass filter <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, where the first band-pass filter <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> has a center frequency within about 25 Hz to about 35 Hz and the second band-pass filter <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> has a center frequency within about 40 Hz to about 50 Hz. It is most preferred that the first band-pass filter <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> has a Q-factor from about 3.0 to about 3.5 and that the second band-pass filter <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> has a Q-factor from about 3.5 to about 4.5. Preferably, at least one of the band-pass filters <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> includes a selectable center frequency such that the attenuated frequencies substantially outside the third range of frequencies are adjustable. By way of example, this adjustment may be obtained via single-pole-double-throw switches <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, which are preferably ganged such that they switch bilaterally. Advantageously, a listener could adjust the energy content of the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> by way of switches <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> to suit his or her listening tastes or to ensure compatibility with other equipment, such as speaker equipment, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the voltage controlled amplifier <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is preferably operable to amplify the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> by an amount proportional to an RMS value of the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. This RMS value is preferably produced by the RMS detector <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the RMS signal on node <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> preferably corresponds to an instantaneous amplitude of the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The limiter <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and summation circuit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are preferably employed to reduce the instantaneous amplitude of the RMS signal on node <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> if it exceeds a threshold, for example, a threshold which when exceeded would overload the voltage controlled amplifier <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The output of the voltage controlled amplifier <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> on node <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is a sub-harmonic signal containing energy at frequencies which were not in the original input signal, but which corresponds to energy at frequencies of the input signal within the second range of frequencies. Advantageously, the RMS detector <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> ensures that the amplitude envelope of the sub-harmonic signal on node <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> substantially corresponds to the amplitude envelope of the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> even though the frequency content of the sub-harmonic signal on node <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> falls within a range approximately one octave below the frequency content of the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. It has been found that the correspondence of the amplitude envelope of the sub-harmonic signal on node <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> with the amplitude envelope of the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> results in very pleasing audible characteristics when the input signal contains audio data, such as music. </paragraph>

These unwanted high frequencies are sometimes produced by non-ideal circuit characteristics of the voltage controlled amplifier <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in accordance with at least one further aspect of the present invention, the sub-harmonic generator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention preferably includes a sub-harmonic enhancement circuit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> that is operable to boost energy of the input signal at frequencies from among a fourth range of frequencies (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference>) and aggregate the sub-harmonic signal taken at node <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or node <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> with the boosted energy at those frequencies. The sub-harmonic enhancement circuit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> preferably includes a band-pass filter <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>, an amplifier <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, and a summation circuit <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. The band-pass filter <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is preferably operable to receive the input signal and to produce an intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> containing frequencies from among the fourth range of frequencies. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>D, it has been found through experimentation that desirable audible characteristics are obtained in the enhanced sub-harmonic signal on node <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> when the fourth range of frequencies extends from about 40 Hz to about 100 Hz. It is most preferred that the band-pass filter <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> includes one or more band-pass filters each having a respective center frequency such that aggregated outputs from the band-pass filters result in the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, one example of a circuit implementation for the sub-harmonic enhancement circuit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and the band-pass filter <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> in particular, is illustrated. It is most preferred that the band-pass filter <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> include first, second and third band-pass filters <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> having respective center frequencies such that a sum of outputs of the band-pass filters <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> exclude frequencies substantially outside the fourth range. It has been found that desirable characteristics are obtained in the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> when (i) the first band-pass filter <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has a center frequency within about 35 Hz to about 45 Hz, (ii) the second band-pass filter <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> has a center frequency within about 55 Hz to about 65 Hz, (iii) and the third band-pass filter <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> has a center frequency within about 95 Hz to about 105 Hz. It is most preferred that the first band-pass filter <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a center frequency of about 40 Hz, the second band-pass filter <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> has a center frequency of about 58 Hz, and the third band-pass filter <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> has a center frequency of about 98 Hz. It has been found that Q-factors for the band-pass filters <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> may also affect the desirable qualities of the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Experimentation has revealed that advantageous results are obtained when the first band-pass filter <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has a Q-factor from about 1.5 to about 2.0, the second band-pass filter <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> has a Q-factor from about 1.75 to about 2.25, and the third band-pass filter <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> has a Q-factor from about 1.75 to about 2.25.

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the input signal may be obtained from any of the known sources, such as music recording media, other audio processors, etc. By way of example, the input signal is preferably derived from a stereo signal comprised of a left channel and a right channel. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the input signal is preferably obtained by way of a summation circuit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> operable to add a left channel signal and right channel signal to produce the input signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the amplifier <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is preferably operable to increase an amplitude of the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to produce an intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. It is most preferred that the sub-harmonic enhancement circuit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> include an adjustment control operable to vary the magnitude of the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. The adjustment control may be integral to the amplifier <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> or separate without departing from the scope of the invention.

<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</cross-reference>, the summation circuit <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is preferably operable to sum the sub-harmonic signal (from node <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or node <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>) and the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> to produce the enhanced sub-harmonic signal on node <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Any of the known circuit implementations may be utilized to carry out the function of the summation circuit <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. With particular reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the summation circuit <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is preferably implemented utilizing a conventional summing operational amplifier circuit. The filtered sub-harmonic signal on node <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> produced by the low pass filter <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> are input to the summation circuit <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> to produce the enhanced sub-harmonic signal on node <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the summation circuit <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is further operable to sum the (i) the sub-harmonic signal on node <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>; (ii) the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and (iii) the low pass signal on node <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> to produce an enhanced sub-harmonic signal on node <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> suitable for use in a sub-woofer audio application. It is most preferred that a cut-out circuit is employed (integral or separate from the summation circuit <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>) operable to disconnect the filtered sub-harmonic signal on node <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> from the summation circuit <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> such that a pure sub-woofer signal is obtained on node <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, a user is thereby permitted to adjust characteristics of the signal on node <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as desired. Further equalization and/or filtering circuitry may be employed to obtain a more desirable version of the enhanced sub-harmonic signal on node <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In accordance with at least one other aspect of the invention, the sub-harmonic generator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> preferably works in conjunction with a stereo audio processor. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, one such audio processor is preferably an expansion circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> for increasing an apparent stereo width produced by a left channel signal and a right channel signal. The expansion circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> preferably includes a left channel circuit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and a right channel circuit <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> for adjusting respective characteristics of the left channel signal and the right channel signal. The left channel signal and right channel signal may, for example, be the same channel signals utilized to produce the input signal as discussed above with respect to the summation circuit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the left channel circuit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is operable to cancel energy at at least some frequencies from among a fifth range of frequencies from the left channel signal to produce at least a portion of a left channel output signal. It is most preferred that at least some of the frequencies from among the fifth range of frequencies are derived from the right channel signal. Similarly, the right channel circuit <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is preferably operable to cancel energy at at least some frequencies from among a sixth range of frequencies from the right channel signal to produce at least a portion of a right channel output signal. It is most preferred that at least some of the frequencies from among the sixth range of frequencies are derived from the left channel signal. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>E, it has been discovered through experimentation that advantageous results are obtained when one of the fifth and sixth ranges of frequencies extends from about 175 Hz to about 225 Hz and the other of the fifth and sixth ranges of frequencies extends from about 150 Hz to about 200 Hz. Advantageously, removing energy at these selected frequency ranges from respective ones of the left and right channel signals in this manner effectively widens the apparent stereo produced when the left channel output signal and right channel output signal are converted into audible energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the left channel circuit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> preferably includes a high pass filter <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, a band-pass filter <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, an inverting amplifier <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, and a left channel summation circuit <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. The left channel summation circuit <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> preferably includes a first summation circuit <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, an amplifier <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, and a second summation circuit <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. The right channel circuit <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> preferably includes a band-pass filter <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, a high pass filter <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, an inverting amplifier <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>, and a right channel summation circuit <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>. The right channel summation circuit <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> preferably includes a first summation circuit <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight>, an amplifier <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>, and a second summation circuit <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The band-pass filter <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of the left channel circuit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> preferably has a center frequency at about a mid-frequency of the fifth or sixth range of frequencies. For the purposes of illustrating the invention, it is assumed that the center frequency of the band-pass filter <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is at about a mid-frequency of the sixth range of frequencies and is operable to produce an intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> containing frequencies of the left channel signal falling substantially within the sixth range of frequencies. The inverting amplifier <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is preferably operable to produce an inverted left channel signal on node <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> from the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the band-pass filter <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of the right channel circuit <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> preferably has a center frequency at about a mid-frequency of the fifth range of frequencies to produce an intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight> containing frequencies of the right channel signal falling substantially within the fifth range of frequencies. The inverting amplifier <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> preferably produces an inverted right channel signal on node <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> from the intermediate signal on node <highlight><bold>421</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The left channel summation circuit <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is preferably operable to sum at least the left channel signal and the inverted right channel signal on node <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> to produce at least a portion of the left channel output signal. Similarly, the right channel summation circuit <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> is preferably operable to sum at least the right channel signal and the inverted left channel signal on node <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight> to produce at least a portion of the right channel output signal. Since the inverted right channel signal on node <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> has frequency, amplitude and phase characteristics such that energy of the left channel signal at frequencies from among the fifth range of frequencies are substantially attenuated, energy of the right channel output signal falling within the fifth range of frequencies will be of greater significance when compared to the left channel output signal and, therefore, they will also have a greater affect on a listener to the stereo signal produced by the left and right channel output signals. A parallel effect is achieved by reducing energy of the right channel signal falling within the sixth range of frequencies as determined by the left channel signal to produce the right channel output signal. This advantageously widens the perceived stereo produced by the left and right channel output signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the high pass filter <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> of the left channel circuit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is operable to receive the left channel signal and produce a left channel high pass signal on node <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> containing frequencies from among those at or above a first corner frequency. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>E, the first corner frequency is preferably substantially above any of the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth frequency ranges. It has been found that a first corner frequency of about 5.3 KHz yields advantageous characteristics in the left channel output signal. Preferably, the left channel summation circuit <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is further operable to sum the left channel signal, the inverted right channel signal on node <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight>, and the left channel high pass signal on node <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the first summation circuit <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> is preferably operable to sum the left channel high pass signal on node <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> and the inverted right channel signal on node <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> to produce a left channel expansion signal on node <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. The second summation circuit <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> is preferably operable to sum at least the left channel signal and the left channel expansion signal on node <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> to produce at least a portion of the left channel output signal. Preferably, amplifier <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> is operable to adjust an amplitude of the left channel expansion signal on node <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> to vary an amount of that signal available to sum with the left channel signal. Advantageously, this permits a user to adjust the characteristics of the left channel output signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The high pass filter <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> and right channel summation circuit <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> of the right channel circuit <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> operate in substantially the same way as the high pass filter <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and the left channel summation circuit <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> of the left channel circuit <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> except the intermediate signals produced are with respect to the right channel signal and the right channel output signal. Therefore, a detailed description of their operation is omitted for clarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the high pass filter <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and the high pass filter <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> are further operable to amplify frequency components of the left channel signal and the right channel signal, respectively, at or above the respective first and second corner frequencies. This results in further advantages in widening the apparent stereo signal produced by the left channel output signal and the right channel output signal. It also &ldquo;brightens&rdquo; the resulting audible signal. It is preferred that both the first and second corner frequencies are at about 5.3 KHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In accordance with at least one further aspect of the invention, a sub-harmonic generator, such as the sub-harmonic generator <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is utilized in conjunction with the expansion circuit <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>.

With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it is preferred that the enhanced sub-harmonic signal at node <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>A is derived from the enhanced sub-harmonic signal at node <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. For example, the enhanced sub-harmonic signal on node <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is preferably adjustable by way of potentiometer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> such that a user can adjust an amplitude of the enhanced sub-harmonic signal on node <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>A. Turning again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the enhanced sub-harmonic signal on node <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>A is preferably added to the left channel signal and the left expansion signal on node <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>417</bold></highlight> by way of the second summation circuit <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> to produce the left channel output signal. Similarly, the enhanced sub-harmonic signal on node <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>A is preferably added to the right channel signal and the right expansion signal on nodes <highlight><bold>427</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>429</bold></highlight> to produce the right channel output signal. </paragraph>
