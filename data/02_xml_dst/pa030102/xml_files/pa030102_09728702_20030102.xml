<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">In one embodiment, systems and methods for on-line selling and booking of cruises enable a plurality of customers, agents, and cruise lines to interact with a cruise selling and booking system via communication mediums. An interactive tool is provided for compiling, reviewing, and processing information obtained from the cruise lines, customers, and agents. Customers and/or agents may search for and compare various cruise packages to find a cruise that best suits the customer needs and desires. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present systems and methods relate to on-line booking of cruises and in particular concern applications designed to facilitate cruise price comparisons, reservations, booking, and customer management by travel agents as well as individual customers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The growth of the cruise industry has created an increase in the number of passenger cruise lines that sail each year. Each cruise line offers a variety of sailings that vary depending on destination, travel date, cruise ship, cabin category, cabin room, and so forth. While such variety is appealing to potential customers, finding the cruise package that best fits the customer&apos;s preferences and budget is often difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One of the most daunting tasks for a travel agent is keeping track of all of the available cruise sailings. The large amount of information pertaining to each sailing combined with constantly changing information such as pricing and availability makes managing the cruise sailing data very difficult. In addition, each cruise line tends to use its own format for categorizing, storing, and accessing cruise data. Commonly, travel agents choose to work with a select number of the major cruise lines and avoid offering travel packages from the smaller or less familiar cruise lines limiting the customer&apos;s choices. In many instances, customers must call several different travel agents to compile a complete set of cruise options which is time-consuming and frustrating for the customer and burdensome for the travel agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another common problem is that travel agents do not offer generic cruise packages, but instead spend large amounts of time determining the preferences of each individual customer. A travel agent spends, on average, well over one hour with each customer to find cruises that match the customer&apos;s preferences taking into account, for example, past cruise bookings and individual preferences. To actually complete a cruise booking transaction, it takes an average of ten to fifteen phone calls wherein the travel agent is constantly contacting the customers and the cruise lines. This process can take several weeks, and on many occasions, the customer may decide not to book the cruise. Historically, travel agents have been unable to track and manage this customer information. For example, if a customer decides not to book a cruise, but calls back a week later, the travel agent has to rely on his notes to recall the customer&apos;s preferences, the cruise packages they discussed, the quotes given to the customer, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another limiting factor of conventional approaches is that separate computer systems are typically required to complete transactions between the travel agents, their customers, and the various cruise lines. For example, one system may provide an interface between the cruise line and the agent, another may allow the agent to process cruise payments, and another may collect standard contact information from the customer. In addition, many of the cruse lines require travel agents to purchase or lease a dedicated computer system that will allow the travel agents to directly tie into and communicate with the specific cruise line. Most of these &ldquo;proprietary&rdquo; computer systems use highly archaic programs that have a poorly designed interface. Acquisition of the cumbersome systems is a costly endeavor for small scale travel agencies that may not have enough business to support many of the major cruise lines&apos; systems. Also, these systems are limited in expandability, are difficult to keep updated, and may become legacy systems (outdated) the day that they are installed. A further problem with such systems is that they typically incorporate information from a single or a limited number of cruise lines. This results in the travel agent having to purchase or lease different computer systems and software packages to have access to multiple sets of cruise line information increasing the travel agent&apos;s costs which typically must be passed onto the customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another difficulty with conventional approaches is that they fail to factor in customer flexibility. For some customers, the price may be negotiable; for others, the dates of travel may be adjusted. Such flexibility is often ignored and only those cruises that meet a rigid set of criteria are typically presented to the customer. For example, a customer may prefer a cruise to Alaska departing on specific date. The customer may, however, be interested in other cruises to Alaska that depart before or after the specific date. Moreover, the customer may also want to know about the &ldquo;special discount&rdquo; cruise to Hawaii departing during the same time and for the same price. Finding cruise packages that only fall within a rigid set of criteria leave many cruise packages ignored, even though the cruise packages may be of interest to the customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another common problem is that the large number of options makes it difficult to compare accurately various cruise packages. The customer may find prices for competing cruise packages, but unless the customer knows the exact details of each cruise package, it is difficult for the customer to figure out which cruise package is the &ldquo;best deal.&rdquo; For example, suppose X offers a cruise to Panama for $3000 and Y offers a similar cruise to Panama for $2800. Y appears to be a better deal until the customer learns that X&apos;s price is for the Presidential Suite and Y&apos;s price is for a Fourth Class cabin. The many different categories of cruise cabin levels further exacerbate these problems. For example, a single cruise ship may have eight to ten different cabin categories. In addition, other options such as special promotions may also affect the comparison. For example, X may offer a &ldquo;special&rdquo; senior citizen rate of $1700 for a cruise to Panama with lodging in a First Class cabin. Such a promotion may be of interest to customers that qualify for the special rate. Cabin category levels and special promotions are just two of many factors that are part of cruise packages. As more and more factors are considered, comparing cruise packages becomes increasingly more complex, thus making a comprehensive comparison of all available cruise choices to a particular destination a daunting task even for a seasoned travel agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Thus, travel agents are required to rely on expensive, outdated, and proprietary systems, telephone and facsimile communication, as well as separate customer management systems to sell and book cruises. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to systems and methods for on-line selling and booking of cruises. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of the invention wherein a plurality of customers, agents, and cruise lines interact with a cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via communication mediums <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> such as the Internet <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight>. Cruise lines may interact directly with the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and/or via a cruise line interface system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that stores information for one or more cruise lines. The cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment provides an interactive tool for compiling, reviewing, and processing information obtained from the cruise lines, customers, and agents. The customer may obtain information about the cruise lines utilizing components of the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> directly or through interaction with an agent. The customer is thus able to find information about various cruises packages and to book a cruise package either with or without the interaction of an agent utilizing a series of resources as will be discussed in greater detail below and illustrated in subsequent figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> I. On-Line Booking of Cruises </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> An overview of one embodiment of a cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. In the exemplary system, a customer contacts an agent via a telephone and the agent uses a computer (hereinafter &ldquo;agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>&rdquo;) to connect to the Internet <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and to communicate with the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a server component <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, a cruise selling and booking component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and a database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> includes a customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, a cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, an activity database <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, and an agent database <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. It is recognized that the information stored in the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be discretely stored in multiple independent databases, combined in a single database, or a combination thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Using the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the agent accesses the components of the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to find information about the customer, to provide the customer with information about cruise sailings from the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, and to book cruise packages as desired by the customer. Additionally, the agent may collect and store information about the customer in the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and may further access resources of the agent database <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> which stores information relating to the agent and his customers, allowing the agent to better manage his customer communication, scheduling, and interactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B, a</cross-reference> customer may access resources of the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> using a computer (hereinafter &ldquo;customer computer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>&rdquo;) via the Internet <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment a customer may have access to a portion of the functions and resources to which an agent has access, for example, allowing the customer to compare and book cruises with or without additional interaction with an agent. It is recognized that in other embodiments a customer may have the same or greater access. In further embodiments, both agents and customers may access the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> One sample process of selling and booking a cruise will now be described wherein an agent is interacting with the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. It is recognized that in other embodiments, however, the same and/or similar process may be used by a customer to book a cruise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The agent uses the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to log onto the website and to submit customer identification information to the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> receives the customer identification information, searches for the appropriate customer data in the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, and returns the related customer information to the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may also manage requests for adding new customers to the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and/or updating customer information for existing customers in the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The agent may then use the customer information to help the customer define a set of cruise preferences. The customer information may include, for example, booking history, favorite cruise lines, destinations, travel dates, and so forth. The agent may then submit the customer&apos;s cruise preferences to the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> receives the cruise preferences and queries the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> for cruise packages that are a close match to the submitted cruise preferences. In other embodiments, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may receive cruise package information from other sources such as, for example, by directly contacting individual cruise lines, by contacting third party booking engines, by querying proprietary databases, and so forth. After receiving the cruise package information, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> compiles and returns the cruise sailings that match the customer&apos;s preferences and may also return other cruise sailings that may be of interest to the customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> compiles and formats the returned query cruise package information from the various databases, cruise lines, and/or booking engines in a uniform manner so as to allow the information to be presented in a user-friendly format. In one embodiment, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may also store information received from databases, cruise lines, and/or external booking engines in the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The agent receives the cruise package information and may discuss the various packages with the customer. In one embodiment, the cruise package information may include cabin availability and/or pricing information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> When the customer has decided which cruise to book, the agent sends a cruise reservation/booking request to the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> receives the cruise reservation/booking request and verifies the availability of the space aboard the cruise line of interest and returns a cruise reservation/booking confirmation to the agent. If the customer, however, decides not to book a cruise, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may store the customer&apos;s cruise preferences and/or the returned cruise sailing information in the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> II. Benefits of On-Line Booking of Cruises </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> allows a customer and/or agent to search for and compare the various cruise packages to find a cruise that best suits the customer needs and desires. One benefit of one embodiment is that customers and/or agents have access to up-to-date cruise package information from multiple cruise lines without having to spend unnecessary quantities of time requesting and compiling information independently from each cruise line. Because the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is available for immediate access via the communication mediums <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the customers and/or agents may request information such as pricing and cabin availability and receive accurate and timely responses. The information is desirably accessible throughout all hours of the day and is typically not dependent on the cruise line having service representatives provide the information to the customer or agent via traditional telephone and facsimile communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Another benefit of one embodiment is that the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may take into account customer flexibility by enabling the customer to specify a range of preferences. For example, the customer may want to search for cruises that depart anytime during a seven-day period or for cruises traveling to a general region of the world. In addition, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may select cruises that may be of interest to the customer but are different from those specified in the customer&apos;s cruise package preferences. For example, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may search for cruises packages that depart on dates before or after those specified by the customer, cruise packages that provide special discounts for attributes that match the customer&apos;s profile (e.g., a children cruise free), cruise packages that match preferences that the customer previously requested, as well many other cruise packages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> An additional benefit of one embodiment is that the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be utilized by agents and/or customers. In some embodiments, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may provide different functionality in comparing and searching cruises to agents, whereas in other embodiments, the customers and agents may have access to the same functionality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> A further benefit of one embodiment is that the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> allows for accurate and visually accessible comparisons of cruise packages. The agent/customer computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may display and compare detailed sets of competing cruise packages at the same time so as to facilitate identifying similarities and differences among cruises. Thus, the value of a particular cruise may be readily compared to help the customer and/or agent identify those cruises which both suit the customer&apos;s preferences and provide the customer with the most luxury and options for the money the customer is willing to spend. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of one embodiment is that the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> provides a single system that finds cruises which best suit the needs of the customer; interacts with the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and cruise lines to perform functions related to reserving and booking of the selected cruise; processes and manages payment information such as credit card or bank account information to collect payments for the selected cabins on the cruise ship and cruise sailing of choice; and upon receiving confirmation from the cruise line that the cabin has been booked, passes the confirmation information to the customer and/or agent to finalize the transaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> An additional advantage of one embodiment is that the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> advantageously includes a number of customer management features increasing productivity and booking success rates. As discussed above, a customer information database may store detailed information about each customer such that the customer and/or agent may be able to input, update, and retrieve customer information. This detailed information helps the agent recall the individual characteristics of the customers with whom he interacts and provides a useful tool for improving customer relations. For example, in addition to personal information such as name, address, and contact numbers, the agent may store information about the customer&apos;s cruise preferences and previous sailing experiences to help create an appropriate cruise package for the customer without repeatedly questioning the customer. The customer feels more at ease and enjoys a more personable experience in cruise booking when the agent can recall his personal information which may otherwise be forgotten by agents who deal with numerous individuals on a daily basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> An additional benefit of one embodiment is that customers and/or agents may use customer information to match upcoming cruises with customers who would be potentially interested in purchasing based on personal preferences and previous sailing experiences. Cruises which the customer may be more likely to able to afford, may be prioritized in favor of more expensive cruises. The cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may use the customer&apos;s marital status, age, occupation, and/or recreational interests to tailor the cruise search to include cruises which cater to people of similar interests. Use of customer information to select cruises increases productivity and booking success rates of the agent when interacting with customers in a number of ways, such as, for example, reducing the amount of time used to collect customer information, establishing a better rapport with customers by personalizing the interaction and having detailed customer history at hand without the customer having to provide the same information each time they contact the agent, allowing the agent to quickly assess which cruises are best suited for an individual customer, and providing detailed comparisons of various cruises and pricing levels to help the customer decide which cruise to select. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, one advantage of one embodiment is that the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> provides an intuitive, easy-to-use interface. The cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be implemented using a highly portable language and format. In one embodiment, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be implemented in a centralized server environment accessible via the Internet <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> by multiple users on various platforms running a myriad of standard browser applications. The customer and/or agent&apos;s setup costs and installation time required to access the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is minimized and updates to the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be provided at the centralized server location without causing customer or agent interruption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> III. On-Line Selling and Booking System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the agents and/or customers interact with computers to access the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via communication mediums <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A. Communication Mediums </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The communication mediums <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> include the Internet <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. The Internet <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is a global network of interconnected computers capable of sending and receiving information between one another. The structure of the Internet <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, which is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, includes a network backbone comprising communications channels such as copper wire, optical fiber, or satellite based interconnections between numerous computers, hubs, and routers which control, direct, and maintain information passed between computers. Additional networks branch from the above-mentioned backbone, and these branches, in turn, have sub-networks branching from them, and so on. Typically, information is passed through the network in the form of packets which are discrete pieces the information desirably sent through the network. These packets of information are encoded in a form interpretable by the network infrastructure and may support features such as data compression, encryption, and error correction to optimize the speed and efficiency by which the information is transferred. For a more detailed description of the structure and operation of the Internet <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, please refer to &ldquo;The Internet Complete Reference,&rdquo; by Harley Hahn and Rick Stout, published by McGraw-Hill, 1994. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> One popular segment of the Internet <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is the World Wide Web (or Web). The World Wide Web comprises many thousands of computers which utilize the Internet <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> infrastructure to serve and distribute information. Typically, a server system is capable of two-way communication with other computers and can desirably send information to other computers which request the information or content stored on the server system. The information stored on the server system is typically interpreted using a software package known as a browser, which is capable of displaying graphical, textual, audio and/or visual information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Some of the server systems, which provide information on the World Wide Web, are often referred to as &ldquo;websites&rdquo; and interact with other computers on the World Wide Web. Generally, each website has an associated electronic page or series of electronic pages which the server sends to those computers requesting the information. The requested information generally takes the form of an electronic page (or web page) encoded in one or more specific languages that is interpreted by the requesting computer and the browser which it runs. Several such languages commonly used by web servers include, but are not limited to, Hypertext Markup Language (&ldquo;HTML&rdquo;), JAVA, JAVA Script, Extensible Markup Language (&ldquo;XML&rdquo;), Active Server Pages (&ldquo;ASP&rdquo;), and CGI scripting. The web page provides the requesting computer with a document that organizes the presentation of the information into a display using text, graphical images, audio, and/or video. Furthermore, the computer, on which the online document is viewed, may communicate with the website by sending and receiving information through interface objects such as, for example, fields, buttons, pull down menus, and key entered commands. For a more detailed description on the World Wide Web, please refer to &ldquo;How to Set Up and Maintain a World Wide Web Site&rdquo; by Lincoln D. Stein, published by Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1995. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the communication mediums <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be advantageously be comprised of one or more types of networks without detracting from the invention.

For example, the cruise lines tend to use their own proprietary naming and pricing schemes; they individually select how the data is selected, stored, and configured; and some cruise lines may provide data that other cruise lines do not. For example, many cruise lines use their own system for categorizing cabins and have also use their own pricing schemes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> may normalize all of the data from the various cruise lines into a uniform system. In other embodiments, the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> may be configured to accommodate a wide variety of data. For example, the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> may include a table of categories in which each cruise line may have its own unique set of categories ranked from most luxurious to most economical thus maintaining the individuality of each cruise line while at the same time enabling the various cruise line data to be compared. The cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> may, for example, provide pricing information for the most luxurious cabins for cruise sailings on Cruise Line A and Cruise Line B even though the cruise lines use different cabin naming nomenclature and different category structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The activity database <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> includes information about the activities in the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. These activities may include brochures, leads, quotes, reservations, bookings, as well as other ongoing activity information. In one embodiment, the activity database <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> is closely linked with the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, and the agent database <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The agent database <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> includes information about the agents that use the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Agent information may include the agents&apos; logins, passwords, access privileges, company, address, phone numbers, booking history, current commission, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> While the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference> includes four separate databases, it is recognized that in other embodiments, the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may include other databases and/or some of the exemplary databases may be combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be implemented with Structured Query Language (&ldquo;SQL&rdquo;) code. The structured query language is a language standardized by the International Standards Organization (&ldquo;ISO&rdquo;) for defining, updating, and querying a relational database. It is recognized however, that other code may be used to access the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. For example, in one embodiment, the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may interact with various accessory programs to store, retrieve, and process the information of the databases, such as, for example, dynamic link libraries (&ldquo;DLLs&rdquo;). DLLs (not shown) may interact with the server component <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the cruise selling and booking component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> directly, or with the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> via a database manipulation module, such as, for example, a Microsoft Database Access Object (&ldquo;DAO&rdquo;). The execution of the DLL may be called automatically from within the scripts or routines of the web page documents as needed and may not necessarily require the customer or agent explicitly launch a separate program or series of programs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is implemented using a relational database, such as, for example, those sold by Oracle Corp. or Sybase. It is recognized however that other relational databases may be used and/or other types of databases may be used, such as, for example, object oriented databases, flat file databases, and so forth. Furthermore, the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be implemented as a single database with separate tables or as other data structures that are well know in the art such as linked lists, binary trees, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is implemented as a separate component or separate components from the cruise selling and booking component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and/or the server component <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, though it is recognized that in other embodiments, the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be implemented on the same component as the cruise selling and booking component <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and/or the server component <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. For more information on the types of computers and/or platforms that may be used to run the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, please see the section above entitled &ldquo;Server Component.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> As noted above, one embodiment that is implemented using a web server (&ldquo;web server environment&rdquo;) provides several advantages. First, the web server environment does not require any dedicated hardware or software to be installed on the customer or agents computer which will utilize the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. This advantage may apply to both customers and agents in that they do not have the burden of expense normally associated with purchasing or licensing a dedicated system. Second, maintenance and upgrades of the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be centrally administrated and automatically processed with little or no intervention by those using the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. For example, the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> may be updated without the customer&apos;s knowledge. In addition, each computer which connects to the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> automatically receives and connects with the most appropriate software as determined by the web server of the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In addition, the interactive interface of the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, like many interactive web pages, uses the familiar environment of a web browser running on the computer the customer or agent uses, thus, minimizing the learning time required to operate and become proficient with the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> 4. One Embodiment of a Database Collection </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> IV. Accessing the Cruise Selling and Booking System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, both customers and agents may access the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> A. Customer Access </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a customer may access the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> without necessarily interacting with an agent as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. For example, a customer may access the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via a web-based service by utilizing a standard web browser on his own computer to connect to the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> web page. The customer may initiate a session by manually entering the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> web site address in the appropriate field of the browser, or the connection may be established automatically by configuring the browser to access the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> web page upon opening a browser window. When the connection has been established, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> uses web pages to visually prompt the customer for input, collect information from the customer, and/or interactively guide the customer through the process of finding, pricing, and/or booking a cruise package. The information which is sent to the customer is formatted and visually presented in an easy to interpret manner and allows the customer to quickly and accurately find cruise packages which suit the customer&apos;s preferences. In one embodiment, should the customer desire the assistance of an agent, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may automatically store the information entered by the customer in the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and an agent with access to the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may subsequently retrieve the information. This feature provides improved customer/agent interactivity by saving customers from repeating information previously entered in the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to each agent with whom they interact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> B. Agent Access </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the agent may use an agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, similarly configured as the customer computer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> described above, to access the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. In one embodiment, agents and customers may access different cruise selling and booking systems <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or the same cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Moreover, agents and customers may be given different types of access to the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. For example, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may permit an agent to access additional resources and web pages of the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to which the customer may not have access such as commission information. Furthermore, in one embodiment, different agents may have different types of access to the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> depending on their status, such as, for example, agent in training, seasoned agent, manager, and system administrator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, an agent may access the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via a web-based service by utilizing a standard web browser on his computer to connect to the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> web page either manually or automatically as discussed above. When the connection has been established, the agent may access several features of the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. For example, an agent may access an interface to enter customer information into the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> databases for later retrieval. The agent may also search information stored in the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, such as detailed information and summaries with more complete descriptions and statistics of each cruise, detailed pricing and availability information about each cruise including actual cost and percentage markups. The agent may also narrow the number of cruises to be selected from based on a customer&apos;s profile and preferences and compare multiple cruise packages in a side-by-side manner. Furthermore, the agent may access cruise ship reservation, confirmation, booking, and payment features. These features allow the agent to sell and book cruises over the Internet <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> V. Cruise Selling and Booking System Processes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes several processes, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, such as, a cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, a collection of customer module <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> processes, a collection of cruise module processes <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, and a collection of booking module <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> A. Cruise Selling and Booking Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of an overview of a cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and will now be described in more detail. For purposes of illustration, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> will be described wherein the user is an agent though it is recognized that in other embodiments the user may be a customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Beginning at a start state (block <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>), the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> proceeds to a login state (block <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>) wherein the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> verifies the agent&apos;s login and password. Proceeding to a customer search state (block <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>), the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> receives a set of customer identification information, and searches and retrieves the corresponding customer information from the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. Proceeding to a qualify state (block <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>), the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> receives a set of customer preferences and searches and retrieves cruise sailing information that matches the customer&apos;s preferences. Proceeding to a cruise detail state (block <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>), the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> receives selected cruise sailings and searches and retrieves detailed information, such as pricing and availability, for the selected cruise sailings. Proceeding to a booking state (block <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>), the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> receives a selected cruise package and books the selected cruise package with appropriate cruise line. Proceeding to a payment state (block <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>), the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> receives and processes the customer&apos;s payment information and proceeds to an end state (block <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Exemplary screen displays will now be discussed to further describe the various status of the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The screen displays illustrate one embodiment of the invention, and it is recognized that in other embodiments, other screen displays may be used and/or other interfaces may be used such as a touch screen, a hand held device, or other interfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> 1. Login </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> In the start state (block <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>), the process initializes and then proceeds to the login state (block <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>) wherein the agent performs standard login procedures that are well known in the art. The login process ensures that only authorized users may access the web site and contents of the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and/or determines the appropriate level of access for each user. Login procedures by entry of a username and password specifying a valid agent account on the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are typically used to provide validation of the agent&apos;s status, though it is recognized that other procedures may be used. Securing the web site and allowing access to only authorized users is well known and readily understood by those of skill in the art. Once the agent attempts to login by sending the agent&apos;s assigned login identification and secure password to the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> looks up the agent&apos;s login identification in the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> database and verifies the agent&apos;s password. If the agent&apos;s login identification is not found or the password was not verified, then the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> returns an error message to the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. If the agent&apos;s login identification is found and the password is verified, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> proceeds to the customer search state (block <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> a. Main Menu </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, upon successful login, the agent is directed to a main menu web page, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, which includes user interface tools, such as buttons or links, for accessing the various features of the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. For example, the exemplary main menu <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> display allows the agent to access features such as selling and booking <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, back office <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, inventory management <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, product management <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, and administrative features <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight>. The main menu <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> serves as a starting point for each of the features described above. In one embodiment, the agent may return to the main menu <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> throughout the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The main menu <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> may also provide the agent with an activity listing <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> which may include categories for bookings <highlight><bold>571</bold></highlight>, brochures <highlight><bold>572</bold></highlight>, leads <highlight><bold>573</bold></highlight>, options <highlight><bold>574</bold></highlight>, and quotes <highlight><bold>575</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, each of the categories has an associated numerical value that indicates the number of currently active customers which fall into the activity listing <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> category. The purpose of the activity listing <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> is to provide the agent with a quick summary of information for those customers he should contact. Each activity listing <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> enables the agent to access a listing of the customers who fall within the activities groups described above. In the illustrated embodiment, the agent may select any of the activity listings <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> which will then direct him to a separate screen showing the details of the selected activity listing <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the main menu may include a &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight> which includes subcategories such as phone calls <highlight><bold>581</bold></highlight> and tasks <highlight><bold>582</bold></highlight>. The &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight> provides a reminder for activities for which the agent should initiate and follow up. In a similar manner to the activity listing <highlight><bold>570</bold></highlight> above, the agent may select any of the items in the &ldquo;to do&rdquo; list <highlight><bold>580</bold></highlight> in order to access a listing of customers who fall within the subcategories as well as information for contacting the customers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> To proceed to the customer search state (block <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>), the agent may select the Selling and Booking feature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> 2. Customer Search </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Proceeding to the customer search state (block <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>), the agent is directed to a search web page <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, wherein the agent may select among a set of options related to searching customer information. In the exemplary search web page <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, the agent may search for customers based on data entered in fields which correspond to the information stored in the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> The customer information may be organized in a set of fields <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> that are indexed within the database so as to be retrievable individually or in groups by the search process. For example, the exemplary query fields <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> allow the agent to search for a customer in a number of ways including the customer&apos;s last name <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>, first name <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, state <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight>, zip code <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight>, phone number <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight>, customer number <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight>, order number <highlight><bold>627</bold></highlight>, and/or reservation number <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> After the agent enters the search information, the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> sends the customer information to the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> then receives the customer information and searches for customers in the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> that match the submitted information. If no matching customers are found, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> sends a message to the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> that no search results were found. If matching customers are found, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> formats and returns the results of the search to the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> displays the list of matching customers as a set of search results <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> and allows the agent to select a customer <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> and designate the selected customer as the &ldquo;active customer.&rdquo; For a more detailed description of one embodiment of the search state (block <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>), see the section below entitled &ldquo;Customer Module Processes&mdash;Customer Search Process.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> When a customer is active, the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and/or the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may use the customer&apos;s stored information to enhance the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> as will be discussed in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may also allow the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to perform additional searches wherein the agent may change the information contained in the search query fields <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> to find other customers. When a new search is performed the results of the previous search are discarded and the results of the new search are displayed in the search results section <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> of the search web page <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, when a matching customer is found, the agent may select the customer and proceed to the qualification process state (block <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> 3. Qualification </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> In the qualification state (block <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>), the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> receives a customer&apos;s preferences and finds cruise sailings that match the customer&apos;s preferences. The qualification state allows the agent to reduce the number of cruise sailings he may present to the customer and to focus on the more appropriate cruise sailings. In the cruise industry, it is typical that there are many available cruises sailings which a customer could take within a specified time frame. In order to reduce the amount of time the agent spends describing individual cruise packages to the customer, it is more efficient and less frustrating to the customer to first narrow the choices of cruise sailings based on the customer&apos;s preferences. In one embodiment, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> reduces or eliminates cruises of which the customer has no interest or cannot book based on a series of selectable criteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The customer&apos;s sailing preferences may include a variety of factors and may be based on information about the customer from the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, such as, for example, booking history, preferred suppliers, and/or future destinations, as well as new information from the customer such as, for example, number of passengers per cabin, currently preferred destination, and so forth. In other embodiments, the customer&apos;s sailing preferences may include the price range; the desirable range of dates and duration of the cruise in which the customer is willing or able to participate; the desired destination or region of the world where the cruise will travel to as well as the home gateway from which the cruise ship will depart; the cruise ship supplier or company which the customer may have preference for including specific cruise ships within a cruise line&apos;s fleet; and/or special conditions pertaining to the customer which might make him eligible for discounted rates or particular sailings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of customer preference web page <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> or qualification display with a preference section <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary qualification display <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, the preferences section <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> includes number of persons per cabin <highlight><bold>721</bold></highlight>, dates of travel <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight>, home gateway <highlight><bold>723</bold></highlight>, number of nights of travel <highlight><bold>724</bold></highlight>, day of embarkation <highlight><bold>725</bold></highlight>, and port of embarkation <highlight><bold>726</bold></highlight>. In addition, the preferences section <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight> enables the agent to view a set of travel regions <highlight><bold>727</bold></highlight>, itineraries <highlight><bold>728</bold></highlight>, suppliers <highlight><bold>729</bold></highlight>, ships <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>, and/or ports <highlight><bold>731</bold></highlight>. In addition, the agent may search by supplier contract number <highlight><bold>732</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may generate such information from the database collection <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, however, it is recognized that in other embodiments, the information may be entered in whole or in part as separate data or not included at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary qualification display <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, the agent has restricted the search to cruises allowing two persons per cabin, from Sep. 8, 2001 to Sep. 16, 2001 sailing for seven nights, and departing on any day of the week. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> When the agent has entered the appropriate information listed above, the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> submits the customer&apos;s sailing preferences to the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> receives the information and searches for cruise sailings in the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> that fall within the range of the submitted criteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> If no matching cruise sailings are found, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may inform the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> that no sailings were found, or the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may return cruise search results <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> that include a set of &ldquo;suggested&rdquo; cruise sailings that do not meet the criteria but still may be of interest to the customer. Such &ldquo;suggested&rdquo; cruise sailings may be selected on the basis of several factors. For example, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may suggest cruises sailings that depart on dates before or after those specified by the customer, cruise sailings that provide special discounts for attributes that match the customer&apos;s profile (e.g., children cruise free), cruise sailings that match preferences that the customer has previously requested, as well many other cruise sailings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> If matching cruise sailings are found, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> sends a set of matching cruise sailings to the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. As described above, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may also include a set of suggested cruise sailings with the matching cruise sailings. For a more detail description of one embodiment of the qualification state (block <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>), please see the section below entitled &ldquo;Cruise Module Processes&mdash;Cruise Qualification Process.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> After the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> receives the set of cruise sailings, the agent may select a subset of the cruise sailings and send them to the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and proceed to the cruise detail state (block <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary set of cruise search results <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> that enables the agent to view and select number of cruise sailings by marking the &ldquo;check box&rdquo; <highlight><bold>742</bold></highlight> that corresponds to the selected cruise package. An exemplary cruise search results section <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> wherein the first cruise package is the Carnival Tropicale ship scheduled to depart on Sep. 8, 2001 for a seven day cruise to the Western Caribbean. The agent has selected the Carnival Tropicale, the Princess Dawn Princess, and the Royal Caribbean Explorer of the Seas. In one embodiment, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may also include guidelines for ranking the order in which the cruise sailings are displayed and/or provide separate designations for &ldquo;matching&rdquo; and &ldquo;suggested&rdquo; cruise sailings, such as, for example, by availability, by departure date, by average cost, and so forth. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the agent has selected three cruise sailings and may proceed to the cruise detail state (block <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> It is recognized that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of a cruise search results section <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> and that in other embodiments, other cruise search results sections <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> may be used. For example, in another embodiment, the cruise search results section <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> may include information about pricing, such as Block pricing and/or FIT pricing information, as well time stamp information indicating when the information was last updated by time and date. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> 4. Cruise Detail </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> In the cruise detail state (block <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>), the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> receives the selected cruise sailings and retrieves additional details about the cruise sailings such as, for example, availability, rate options, pricing information, package information, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> enables the agent to select a cruise sailing, view and select available rate options for the selected cruise sailing, view pricing information based on the selected rate options, and compare sailing/pricing information for multiple cruise sailings. For a more detailed description of one embodiment of the cruise detail state (block <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>), please see the section below entitled &ldquo;Cruise Module Processes&mdash;Cruise Comparison Process.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of a cruise detail web page <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> wherein the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is presented with a list of the selected cruise sailings in the &ldquo;Select A Cruise&rdquo; section of the display <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary cruise detail web page <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, the agent has selected three cruise sailings, the Carnival Tropicale, the Princess Dawn Princess, and the Royal Caribbean Explorer of the Seas. From those sailings, the agent may choose to view additional information which is displayed in a &ldquo;Cruise Detail&rdquo; section <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of the cruise detail web page <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> after the agent has selected the Princess Dawn Princess, and the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> has retrieved the available rate options <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> for the Princess Dawn Princess and placed them in the &ldquo;Cruise Detail&rdquo; section <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>. Rate options, also referred to as pricing options, are the representative pricing categories that the agent selects for the customer. Each cruise sailing has a variety of rate options that set the prices for the multiple categories of cabins. Travel agents use the rate options along with other pricing information to find the best rate for the customer while at the same time maximizing their own commission. Due to the large number of possible rate options for each of the multiple cabin categories, it is often useful for the agent to limit the pricing information of each sailing to a smaller subset of information based on the customer&apos;s profile and preferences. In one embodiment, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may restrict the number of rate options that may be selected (e.g. to four or five). These rate options may include the discounts associated with package deals for air and extended stay vacation. Other examples include local resident discounts, senior discounts, group rates, and so forth. The display in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> includes a rate option &ldquo;code&rdquo; <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>, name and detail of the code <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight>, the dates for which each code is valid <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>, as well as the status of the option <highlight><bold>918</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary display, the user has selected rate code BNPTPXUSD for the Princess Dawn Princess cruise sailing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> It is recognized that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of available rate options <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> and that in other embodiments, other available rate options <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> may be used. For example, in other embodiments, different types of data may be displayed and/or some of the data may be excluded from the display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of a cruise detail web page <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> wherein the prices for the available cabin categories for the designated sailing that match the selected rate options are displayed in a price matrix <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. The exemplary display <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> shows the &ldquo;Best Price&rdquo; matrix <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> which includes a category code <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight>, an upgrade field <highlight><bold>1012</bold></highlight>, cabin category type <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight>, promotion price <highlight><bold>1014</bold></highlight>, best full tariff price <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight>, best agency price <highlight><bold>1016</bold></highlight>, and pricing description information <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The exemplary price matrix <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> displays the pricing information for the selected rate options in table format with heading descriptions at the top of the table such that each row includes information that corresponds with an individual pricing plans. For example, for category <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>D, the GG promotional rate is $99999.00, the Best Fit price is $3400.00 and the Best TRVL price is $2900.00. In one embodiment, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may return a &ldquo;not available&rdquo; designation (e.g., &ldquo;N/A&rdquo;) if no cabins are available in that category. To the left of each pricing plan option, there is an arrow <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> that enables the agent to open a window directly underneath the row in question that will display the specifics of the pricing plan. There is also another arrow <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight> that enables an agent to select a pricing category for display. In one embodiment, the price matrix may include functionality to further refine the searching criteria. For example, the default for the passenger field is two persons, upon changing an entry in a field of the price matrix window, the entire pricing scheme may be updated in real time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> In addition, the price matrix may be altered such as, for example, by reducing the number of viewed items (e.g., when the agent selects &ldquo;Show Selected&rdquo;), displaying additional detailed information regarding a sailing, as well as showing all of the locations of cabins, lounges, and entertainment on any selected ship (e.g., when the agent selects &ldquo;Deck&rdquo;). In one embodiment, the agent may switch between a variety of price matrices such as, for example, a price matrix with the &ldquo;best price&rdquo; information, a price matrix with detailed information, a price matrix with airfare information, and so forth. For example, in the exemplary display of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the agent is viewing the &ldquo;Best Price&rdquo; matrix and may select the &ldquo;Detail&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> to display a &ldquo;Detail&rdquo; price matrix with detailed information on the Princess Dawn Princess cruise sailing on Sep. 9, 2001. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may select another cruise from the &ldquo;Select A Cruise&rdquo; section <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> and view more detailed information about the newly selected cruise in the &ldquo;Cruise Detail&rdquo; section <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> While the cruise detail display <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> may, in one embodiment, display details for one cruise package at a time, the display may also include a side-by-side compare display section <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The side-by-side compare display <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> allows the agent to evaluate a number of specific sailings, under specific criteria, in a side-by-side comparison. The windows may be cleared and populated with new information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The agent may choose to add one of the categories of the sailing in the cruise detail section to the compare display by selecting a category in the price matrix <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary display, the category may be sorted by selecting the arrow <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight> in the price matrix. It is recognized that in other embodiments, the agent may select a category using other user interface techniques that are well known in the art. In one embodiment, the compare display <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> may allow the user to display detailed information of up to N different cruise categories at one time where N is an integer determined, for example, by the size of the display. The exemplary compare display <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> allows the user to display up to three different cruise categories at one time (N&equals;3). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> receives the agent&apos;s selections of specific pricing categories from &ldquo;Cruise Detail&rdquo; section <highlight><bold>830</bold></highlight>, retrieves the relevant information, and places the information in an available compare display window <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight>. For example, in the exemplary compare display <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>, the ship information, and the associated sailing date is located in an information bar. In one embodiment, the compare display information includes itinerary type, rate options, number of nights for which the cruise sails, category, and so forth. The compare display <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> may also provide the agent with access to a number of other features. For example, the agent may hold an &ldquo;option&rdquo; for the customer or &ldquo;book&rdquo; a reservation using the buttons below the information bar. Furthermore, the agent may &ldquo;quote&rdquo; a price to the customer that will last for a predetermined amount of time. The agent may also place a cabin &ldquo;on hold&rdquo; for a predefined amount of time. If the requested cabin is not available, then the agent may request another cabin. In addition, by selecting the &ldquo;Clear&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight>, the agent may remove the specific pricing information from the compare display and allow for the window to either remain open or be filled with another selected set of category price information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, all of the windows may be compared simultaneously and a scrolling feature may be initiated ensuring that all of the windows will display the same sets of information to agent at the same time. Thus, when the agent scrolls down the first window in the display, the other windows will also scroll down simultaneously. Furthermore, when one set of data is removed and another is added, it will appear in the same position as the other two, so that the information display may remain synchronized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The cruise details and pricing information displayed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> illustrate various embodiments of the invention, however, it is recognized that in other embodiments different sets of cruise detail information may be presented to the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In addition, access to the cruise detail may also be presented to the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> in a different layout. For example, the price matrix may be arranged by price rather than rate options and categories. Furthermore, in some embodiments, some of the pricing information may be restricted if the user is a customer. For example, the price matrices may display a brochure price and an Internet discount price rather than providing the customer with all possible pricing schemes, though it is recognized in other embodiments, the customer may have access to all pricing information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> After comparing the various cruise packages, the agent may inquire as to whether the customer wants to book one of the cruise packages. If the customer has not found the right package, the agent may view more cruise details and/or modify the customer&apos;s cruise package criteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> If the customer has decided to book one of the cruise packages, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may then proceed to the booking state (block <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Proceeding to the booking state (block <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>), the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> requests more detailed information about the customer and the customer&apos;s selected cruise package. In one embodiment, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> presents the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> with a cruise booking web page <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The exemplary cruise booking web page <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> includes a booking worksheet <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight>, wherein pricing information may be viewed per passenger, in total, as well as according to the agent&apos;s commission. The worksheet <highlight><bold>1220</bold></highlight> includes standard cruise pricing information <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight>, such as, cabin fees, government fees, and port charges. In addition, the worksheet <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> includes an air and miscellaneous section <highlight><bold>1214</bold></highlight> that permits the agent to adjust the prices to include excursions (e.g., helicopter tour, mountain biking trip, day hike, snorkeling outing, etc.), pre-paid expenses, air fares, additional air, pre-post add-on, other add-ons, miscellaneous fees, tour conductor fees, coupons, and so forth. Furthermore, the exemplary worksheet <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> includes a section for taxes and fees <highlight><bold>1216</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may submit reservation information pertaining to the cruise package such as cabin number, deck level, location, bed type, special requests, smoking preference, dining reservations, as well as other related information as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The exemplary reservation information web page <highlight><bold>1310</bold></highlight> includes a general information section <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight>, a cabin section <highlight><bold>1330</bold></highlight>, a dining request section <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight>, and an option section <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight>. The general information section <highlight><bold>1320</bold></highlight> includes information about the cruise package, such as, for example, Trip Start Date, Trip End Date, Itinerary, Supplier Contract Number, Order Number, Rate Option, Agent of Record, and so forth. The cabin section <highlight><bold>1330</bold></highlight> includes information about the reserved cabin, such as, for example, cabin number, status, deck, location, smoking preference, bath type, bed type, and so forth. The dining request section <highlight><bold>1340</bold></highlight> includes information about the dining options, such as seating, status, table size, smoking preference, and so forth. The option section <highlight><bold>1350</bold></highlight> includes information about the option, such as expiration, extension date, final payment due date, a use extension date field, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> After the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> submits the information, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may assign a customer order number. For a more detailed description of the booking state (block <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>), please refer to the section below entitled &ldquo;Booking Module Processes-Cruise Booking Process.&rdquo; After the agent submits the booking information, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> proceeds to the payments state (block <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> In the payments state (block <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>), the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> receives the customer&apos;s payment information from the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, and directs the funds to appropriate entities preferably via a back office process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may contact the cruise lines and other third parties directly or via a separate system to provide payment information. For a more detailed description of the payment state (block <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>), please refer to the section below entitled &ldquo;Booking Module Processes Cruise Payment Process.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> After the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> receives payment information, the back office process verifies that the customer&apos;s payment is valid and that the appropriate entities are paid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of a payment information web page <highlight><bold>1410</bold></highlight>. The &ldquo;Credit Card Information&rdquo; section <highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight> includes information about the customer&apos;s credit card and/or debit card such as card number, expiration date, name as it appears on the card, zip code of card holder, authorization code, and so forth. The &ldquo;Supplier&rdquo; section <highlight><bold>1430</bold></highlight> includes information about the various suppliers in the cruise package that require payment. Suppliers may include, for example, the cruise line, excursion groups, travel insurance companies, airlines, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> While an overview of the process of online booking of cruises has been discussed, it is recognized that other methods of booking online cruises may also be used. For example, the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may use only a subset of the discussed states such as using only the qualified state, the cruise detail state, and/or the booking state. In addition, in other embodiments, the customer may interact directly with the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> without the assistance of an agent or with partial assistance from an agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> B. Customer Module Processes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may also include a customer module <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> that includes a collection of customer module <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> processes. The exemplary customer module <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> processes shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> include a customer add process <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, a customer search process <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, and a customer update process <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> 1. Customer Add Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the customer module <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may include a customer add process <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> that permits the agent to add new customers to the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. When the new customer function is selected, a series of fields are displayed on the agent computer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> in a web page document. The agent enters customer information into the fields which may include first name, last name, gender, phone number, address, e-mail address, birth date, age, interests, hobbies gateway city, marketing information, cabin preferences, favorite excursion activities, and so forth. As illustrated above, the customer information may include standard contact information as well as social and recreational activities in which the customer may be interested in participating, on-shore activities such as shopping, dining, and events which may require prior reservations to attend, and so forth. In one embodiment, all of the above fields need not all be filled in at the time of adding a customer. For example, the agent may store any information he has entered and return at a later time to add additional customer information as it becomes available. In some embodiments, however, one or more fields may be optionally tagged so as to require certain information to be entered within the field before proceeding to a subsequent function. In addition, data validation techniques may be used to ensure that only proper customer information is entered in the database (e.g., credit card check, phone number validation, email validation, etc.) For more information on the customer information, please refer to the section above entitled &ldquo;Customer Database.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, adding new customers or editing existing customer information may occur during the time when an agent is in communication with a customer. The agent is able therefore to populate the customer information fields by asking the customer about the appropriate information which should be entered enabling the agent to construct a detailed customer profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> 2. Customer Search Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the customer module <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may also include a customer search process <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> that permits the agent to search for existing customers in the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the customer search process <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> receives a set of search criteria. The search criteria may include information, such as, the customer&apos;s last name, first name, state, zip code, phone number, customer number, order number, and/or reservation number. The customer search process <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> then formulates a query and sends the query to the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. Next, the customer search process <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> receives the query results from the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. If there are no items in the query results, the customer search process <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> returns a &ldquo;No Results Found That Match Your Query&rdquo; message. If there are items in the query results, the customer search process <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> organizes the search query results or part of the query into a data structure, such as, for example, a table or a list, and returns the query results. In one embodiment, a user may then select the item that matches the customer for which he is searching. If there is only one item in the query results, the customer search process <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> may instead return a display of the corresponding data for the single search query result, rather than a one item list of search results, thus permitting the user to bypass the selection of the item from the list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> 3. Customer Update Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the customer module <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may also include a customer update process <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> that permits the agent to update an existing customer&apos;s record in the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the customer update process <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> may incorporate part or all of the customer search process <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> enabling the user to find the customer for which he would like to update the record. Next, the customer update process <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> receives a set of data that has been entered by the user. In one embodiment, the customer update process <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> receives a copy of the entire data record, whereas in other embodiments, the customer update process <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> may only receive copies of the data record that were changed and/or added. The customer update process <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> then determines which data fields have been updated and sends an update request with the changed data to the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the customer update process <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> may send a message to the user signifying whether the update was successful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> C. Cruise Module Processes </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> 1. Cruise Information Add Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the cruise module <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may include a cruise information add process <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> that adds cruise information to the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Cruise information may be collected from a variety of sources. For example, information may be collected from the travel agents, the cruise lines, a cruise line clearing house system, and so forth. Thus, the cruise information add process <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> may receive data from users at web site browsers, via automatic downloads, via import functions, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> The cruise line information may include, for example, cruise line, cruise line contact information, cruise ships, contract information, itinerary, categories, cabins, and so forth. For more information on the cruise line information, please refer to the section above entitled &ldquo;Cruise Line Database.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> The cruise information add process <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> receives a set of cruise line data and formats the data for submission to the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. Next, the cruise information add process <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> submits the formatted data to the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the cruise information add process <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> may send a message to the user signifying whether the add was successful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> 2. Cruise Search Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the cruise module <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may include a cruise search process <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> that searches for information in the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> The cruise search process <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> receives a set of search criteria. The search criteria may include information, such as, the cruise line identifier, cruise ship identifier, sailing dates, destination, home gateway, and so forth. The cruise search process <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> then formulates a query and sends the query to the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. Next, the cruise search process <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> receives the query results from the cruise database. If there are no items in the query results, the cruise search process <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> returns a &ldquo;No Results Found That Match Your Query&rdquo; message. If there are items in the query results, the cruise search process <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> organizes the query results or part of the query results into a data structure, such as, for example, a table or a list, and returns the query results. In one embodiment, a user may then select the search result that matches the cruise information for which he is searching. If there is only one item in the query results, the cruise search process <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> may instead return a display of the corresponding data for the single search result, rather than a one item list of query results, thus permitting the user to bypass the selection of the item from the list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> 3. Cruise Qualification Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the cruise module <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> includes a cruise qualification process <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> that permits the agent to qualify customers for cruise sailings in the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> The cruise qualification process <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> receives a set of qualification criteria, such as, for example, booking history, preferred suppliers, number of passengers, currently preferred destination, price range, the desirable range of dates and duration of the cruise in which the customer is willing or able to participate, the desired destination or region of the world where the cruise will travel to as well as the home gateway from which the cruise ship will depart, and/or special conditions pertaining to the customer which might make him eligible for discounted rates or particular sailings. In one embodiment, the cruise qualification process <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> may also query the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> to include information that may be of interest for selecting cruises. For example, the cruise qualification process <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> may query the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> to determine whether the customer prefers high-end cruises or more economical cruises, whether the customer may qualify for a senior citizen discount, and so forth. The cruise qualification process <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> formats the criteria and sends a query to the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> with the criteria. The cruise qualification process <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> then receives a set of potential cruise line sailings from the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. If there are no items in the set of potential cruise line sailings, the cruise qualification process <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> returns a &ldquo;No Results Found That Match Your Query&rdquo; message. If there are items in the set of potential cruise line sailings, the cruise qualification process <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> organizes the set of potential cruise line sailings or a part of the potential cruise line sailings into a data structure, such as, for example, a table or a list, and returns the set of potential cruise line sailings. In one embodiment, a user may then select one or more potential cruise sailings that are of interest. If there is only one item in the set of potential cruise line sailings, the cruise qualification process <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> may instead return a display of the corresponding data for the single cruise line sailing, rather than a one item list of set of potential cruise line sailings, thus allowing the user to bypass the selection of the item from the list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> While the above described embodiment illustrates qualifying customers for cruise sailings, it is recognized that the customers may be qualified for other objects, such as, for example, cruise packages, on-shore excursions, advertisements, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> 4. Cruise Comparison Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the cruise module <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> includes a cruise comparison process <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> that permits the agent to compare cruise package information in the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> The cruise comparison process <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> receives a set of selected cruise sailings. In one embodiment, the cruise comparison process <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> then retrieves information related to the selected cruise sailings from the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. The cruise comparison process <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> returns a summary of information for the selected sailings. Next, the cruise comparison process <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> receives a selected sailing and retrieves the rate options that correspond to the selected sailing. The cruise comparison process <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> then formats and returns the rate options. After receiving a set of selected rate options, the cruise comparison process <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> then searches the cruise sailing database for pricing information related to the set of selected rate options and formats the pricing information into a price matrix and returns the price matrix. In one embodiment, the cruise comparison process <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> may instead, or in addition to the above, query an external source for pricing information, such as, for example, a cruise line, a cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, a cruise line clearing house system, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the cruise comparison process <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> may receive a request to view a different set of pricing information, such as for example, the best price matrix, the detailed price matrix, the air/sea matrix, and so forth. The cruise comparison process <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> then retrieves the requested pricing information for the selected matrix, process, and formats the data for display in one of the compare display windows. For example, if the best price matrix is requested, the cruise comparison process <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> may process the pricing data to select only the lowest prices for display in the pricing matrix. In other embodiments, the cruise comparison process <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> may already have the data stored, and thus a retrieval is not necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> The cruise comparison process <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> may also receive a compare display request wherein one of the categories in the price matrix has been selected for display in the compare display. The cruise comparison process <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> then retrieves additional pricing information for the selected category and formats the data for display in one of the compare display windows. In other embodiments, the cruise comparison process <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> may already have the data stored, and thus a retrieval is not necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> The cruse comparison process may then receive a different cruise sailing selection and repeat the above described process for the newly selected cruise sailing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> D. Booking Module Processes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may also include a booking module <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> that includes a collection of booking module <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> processes. The exemplary booking module <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> processes shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference> include a cruise booking process <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> and a cruise payment process <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> 1. Cruise Booking Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the booking module <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> may also include a cruise booking process <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> that permits the agent to book cruises for his customers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> The cruise booking process <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> receives a set of booking or reservation information. The cruise booking process <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> may then format the information and send the information to the activity database <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. This information may include, for example, the cruise ship, the sailing, cabin number for which the customer will be traveling and so forth. In other embodiments, the cruise booking process <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> may format the information and send a booking request to the appropriate cruise line in a variety of formats, such as, for example, via facsimile, via an external query, via an external function call, and so forth. The cruise booking process <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> may then wait for a response from the cruise line. If cruise line responds that the requested cabin is not available, the cruise booking process <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> may return an error message stating &ldquo;The Requested Cabin is No Longer Available.&rdquo; If the cruise line responds with a confirmation of the booking, the cruise booking process <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> may then return a confirmation and may then, in some embodiments, update the activity database <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> 2. Cruise Payment Process </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the booking module <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> may also include a cruise payment process <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> that permits the agent to submit payments for his customers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> The cruise payment process <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> receives a set of payment information. The cruise payment process <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> may then format the information and send the information to the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, the activity database <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, and/or a payments database (not shown). This information may include, for example, vendor identification, amount due, credit card information, expiration date, name of cardholder, and so forth. In other embodiments, the cruise payment process <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> may format the information and send a payment notice to the appropriate vendor(s) (e.g., the cruise line, the off-shore excursion companies, the insurance companies, etc.) in a variety of formats, such as, for example, via facsimile, via an external query, via an external function call, and so forth. The cruise payment process <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> may then wait for a response from the vendor(s). If vendor responds that the payment was not accepted, the cruise payment process <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> may return an error message stating &ldquo;Payment Unable to be Processed.&rdquo; If the vendor responds with a confirmation of the payment, the cruise payment process <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> may then return a confirmation/receipt and may then, in some embodiments, update the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, the activity database <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, and/or the payment database. In other embodiments, the cruise payment process <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> may perform a credit check with a third party system (e.g., banking system, credit card system, etc.) to verify that the customer has the appropriate funds/credit limits to make the payment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> While various embodiments of the above processes have been disclosed, it is recognized that the processes may be implemented in a variety of manners that are well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> VI. Agent Functions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, agents may be assigned to customers based in part on past activity, such as, for example, sending the customer a brochure, qualifying a customer, providing the customer with a quote, or booking a customer on a cruise. The relationship between the agent and the customer may then be used to track the agent&apos;s sales activity, determine the agent&apos;s commission, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, agents may have additional access to part of the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. These functions may be used to assist the agent in pursuing and tracking customer leads and/or sales and help to increase the agent&apos;s likelihood of booking a customer on a cruise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> A first function matches available cruises with previously entered customer preferences. This function uses information stored in the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, and/or the activity database <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, to determine which customers would be interested in a particular cruise based on the information included in the customer information and customer qualification fields. For example, if a customer had specified a desire to travel to the Bahamas during a certain time frame with a particular cruise line, but had not yet booked the cruise, an agent may perform searches based on this information and find matching cruises prior to contacting the customer. When one or more cruises have been identified by the agent as being desirable to the customer based on stored preferences and information, the agent may then contact the customer having the information readily available, increasing the likelihood the customer would book the cruise and improving the customer&apos;s experience with the cruise booking process <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> overall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Further functions related to pursuing customer leads include routines designed to identify previous customers found in the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and matching cruises to these customers based on their prior sailing experiences. This function automates portions of the marketing process and improves the agent&apos;s ability to gather return bookings from previous customers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> An additional function provides special offer matchings wherein the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may search through the cruise line database <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> for special offers which do not apply to all customers and attempt to match cruises with customers in the customer database <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. Typically, such offers are based on specific restrictions such as age or state of residence and offer a reduced rate to individuals that meet the qualification restrictions. The automated matching features of the cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> permit the agent to specifically target customers who meet the restricted requirements and to provide the agent with the customer&apos;s contact information so that the customer may be contacted directly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> The cruise selling and booking system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may also include report generation functions that allow agents to view reports based on, for example, their past activity, past commission, year to date sales, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> The above mentioned functions provide the agent with the necessary tools to better market available cruises to customers. The automated searching functions refine the process of matching customers with potentially desirable cruises and thus improve the likelihood that the customer will book a cruise with the agent. Furthermore, the search refinement reduces the amount of time the agent spends contacting customers who would not likely be interested in the particular cruise or are not qualified for the price which the cruise would be offered. Taken together, these functions improve agent booking success rates, minimize unnecessary customer interaction time, and improve a customer&apos;s experience with the cruise selling and booking process <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
