<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of logging and inspecting of oil, gas and mineral wells. More particularly, the invention relates to a multi-frequency array induction tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Induction logging tools are instruments used in logging operation in boreholes that are drilled into underground rock formations in the search for oil, gas, or minerals. Induction logging tools measure the electrical conductivity of rock formations to determine the presence and the amount of desired minerals in a particular pay-zone. Oil and natural gas cause the rock to have a lower than usual conductivity because these fluids are electrically non-conducting and they displace connate fluids such as conductive saline water. Induction logging tools ideally provide accurate quantitative measures of the fractional saturation of oil or gas in the pay zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Induction logging tools employ arrays of sensors that map the rock conductivity at various radical distances from the borehole so that the perturbing influence of invasion of borehole fluids may be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The tools operate on the principle of induced eddy-currents, also known as Foucault currents, that are substantially proportional to conductivity and which may be excited and detected using sensitive coils. Tools that are known in the art use arrays of coils that provide capabilities of sensing conductivity to one or more different radial depths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Despite advances in induction logging tools, several problems with the tools remain to be solved. For example, induction tools typically report errors due to the influence of adjacent rock-beds of contrasting conductivity. Further, boreholes may hold conductive fluids that influence readings of an induction logging tool. The influence of the conductive fluids increases when the borehole diameter varies due to caving or when the cross-section is not circular due to various drilling problems. Moreover, borehole fluids containing slightly magnetic materials introduce more subtle problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Highly conductive formations present further problems for induction logging tools due to &ldquo;skin effect.&rdquo; Skin effect causes a loss of proportionality between a received signal and formation conductivity, thereby making interpretation of signals from induction logging tools more complex. Skin effect prevents operators from neglecting attenuation of propagated signals in formations that are highly conductive. Typically, induction logging tools allow for a moderate skin effect at higher conductivity and correct for the skin effect. However, responses in highly conductive formations are often non-linear. Corrections for non-linear responses are difficult to make. Conversely, very low conductivity rocks present accuracy problems for logging tools due to low signal to noise ratios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Logging tools that traverse sequences of thin rock-beds or boundaries with high relative dip angles present spurious responses that are difficult to correct. Further, logging tools do not accurately log boreholes that are invaded by borehole fluids that have conductivity very different from the connate fluids in the rock, or that create complex annulus profiles in the invaded zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Several attempts have been made to try to resolve these problems, each of which provided complex and expensive tools, and each of which exhibits some shortcoming in their ability to accurately measure and profile the rock conductivity over a wide range of radial distances in conditions that are commonly encountered in oil explorations. All of these designs employ &ldquo;depth-shifting&rdquo; of the recorded data, to align the effective measurement points of the individual measurements, with resulting errors when the tool motion is erratic. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> perspective view of an embodiment of the present invention is shown. A mobile coiled-tubing apparatus <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is shown positioned over a borehole <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The coiled-tubing apparatus <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> lowers a length of tubing <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, an internal wireline cable (not shown) and an induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in accordance with the invention. Coiled-tubing apparatus <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a drum and winch mechanism to alter the length of tubing to provide movement of the induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> through the borehole. <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The borehole <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is shown as a deviated borehole, although one of skill in the art appreciates that coiled-tubing apparatus <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may operate at numerous angles including horizontal and vertical boreholes as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a coil array and associated electronic signal-processing circuits discussed below. In an embodiment, the casing of induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is of a metal or composite material that enables the induction logging tool components to operate at high temperatures and pressures. For example, in one embodiment, the casing enables the logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to operate at temperatures of up to <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> degrees Centigrade and hydrostatic pressures of up to <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> Bar. Within the metal casing, the electronic signal-processing circuits are enclosed, while the coil array is contained within a non-conductive epoxy-glass enclosure filled with hydraulic oil. The pressure of the enclosure is maintained with a piston compensator located at a lower end of the induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> further includes sensors and may include down-hole data memory circuits and data-transmission circuits for sending the measurements acquired in real-time to the surface for further processing. In one embodiment, a wire-line (not shown) may be used with a side-entry sub to supply power and transmit digitized data to and from induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A, a</cross-reference> schematic diagram of induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a top <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and a bottom <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of transmitter coils <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> all of which are spaced above a set of receiving coils <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>, together shown as receiver coil array <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> One or more circuits <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> are disposed in an upper portion of the induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for energizing the plurality of transmitter coils <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment, the circuits <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> are coupled to the transmitter coils through cables, as is known in the art. Circuits <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> are positioned above the coil array and generate each transmitter energizing current. Receiver circuits <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are positioned below the receiver coil array <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and amplify, filter, and process induced receiver coil voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Two of the plurality of transmitter coils, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are shown with magnetic core material <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> positioned inside of transmitter coils <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the magnetic core material is a magnetically permeable material to enhance the magnetic moment of the coils and compensate the loss of sensitivity due to their low operating frequency. Although two transmitter coils are shown as including magnetic core material, those of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure will appreciate that the need for magnetic core material is related to the distance between the measure point and the transmitter coil. Accordingly, further transmitter coils further from the measure point <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> would also preferably be designed to include magnetic core material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Each transmitter coil of the plurality of transmitter coils is coaxial with receiver coil array <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. Each transmitter coil is further spaced at increasing distances from the receiver coil array <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> to investigate rock formation conductivity at a different radial depth. More particularly, each transmitter coil is spaced from a measure point located at an end of the induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that is a function of each frequency chosen for each transmitter coil. The measure point is located within the receiver coil array <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, also located at the end of the induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In an exemplary embodiment, the measure point is located near the center point of the receiver coil array <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the function is a square root function, such that the distances chosen are functions of the square root of the frequency of the transmitter. In another embodiment, the function is an inverse function such that the distances chosen are inversely related to the frequencies of the transmitter coils. In one embodiment, each transmitter coil is spaced at sequential distances related by a multiplier approximately equal to the square root of two, each transmitter coil further being energized at frequencies in an inversely related sequence of powers of two. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, another embodiment of the induction logging tool is shown. Unlike induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> shows induction logging tool <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> with a plurality of transmitter coil spacings for which the function relating the transmitter coil spacing to the frequency of the transmitter coil is an inverse relationship. As shown, induction logging tool <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> includes seven transmitter coils, <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> disposed above receiver coil array <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight>. According to the embodiment, the transmitter coils are in an approximate inverse relationship with respect to the frequencies assigned to the plurality of transmitter coils. As shown, the transmitter coils are disposed above the measure point <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> in the following spacings: 0.25*N, 0.50*N, 0.75*N, 1.0*N, 1.25*N, 1.5*N and 2.0*N wherein N is a variable representing a fixed distance such as one meter distance. The embodiment shown assumes that N is one meter, however, one of skill in the art appreciates that other fractions and multiples of a meter are within the scope of the invention. For example, other parameters such as the signal processing used after receiving measurement data may dictate different meter distances for N. Further, the number of transmitter coils used can be variable, depending on the accuracy and depth of investigation required by the earth formations being explored. According to an embodiment, at least three transmitter coils are required, each co-located to a measure point within a receiver coil, each transmitter coil having substantially the same axial spatial resolution. An exemplary set of a reduced number of transmitter coil spacings and frequencies from a measure point are provided in Table 1, below.

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown, the long, mid-long, medium and mid-short spacings of the transmitter coils are substantially inversely proportional to the square root of the frequencies associated with the transmitter coils. Each of the spacings is relative to the measure point within the receiver coil array <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. Therefore, there is one measure point co-located for each of the transmitter coils described in Table 1. Advantageously, the co-locating of the measure point with the plurality of transmitter coils obviates the need for depth-shifting. Because there is one co-located receiver coil array for each transmitter coil disposed above the receiver coil array in each of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, the effective measurement point along the axis of the tool is the same for each measurements and no depths-shifting is required. It is a particular advantage that the measurement point is also close to the bottom end of each array induction tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, unlike any other tools known in the art, so that it is not necessary to drill a deeper borehole to accurately measure an oil reservoir. Depth-shifting is a common problem with induction logging tools in that measurements taken with respect to multiple receivers that are not co-located with transmitter coils require a different effective measurement point along the axis of the tool for each measurement taken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment includes determining distances for each transmitter by determining a square root function of the frequency for a transmitter and setting a distance from a measure point that corresponds to the inverse of the square root determination. In one embodiment the square root function is a square root of two function. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring to Table 2, the plurality of transmitter coils shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> as transmitter coils <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> are shown along with the frequency associated with each transmitter coil and the depth of investigation associated with each transmitter coil. The depth of investigation, for purposes of Table 2, is the diameter of formation that contributes 50% of the total response signal. Table 2 assumes a homogeneous rock of low conductivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, receiver coil array <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> is shown including a main receiver <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> and a bucking receiver <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, both of which are positioned at a lower end of the induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In use, the induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is inserted at the lowest end of the borehole. Induction tools, such as induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are generally placed at the bottom end of a &ldquo;tool string&rdquo; or set of sensors. Placing the receiver coil array <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> at the lower end of the induction logging tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> therefore allows logging the full length of the borehole without requiring extra hole to be drilled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Another characteristic of induction array tools <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the arrangement of transmitter coils therein is that they are arranged to produce data with reduced anomalies caused by &ldquo;skin effect&rdquo;. The phenomenon of &ldquo;skin-effect&rdquo; in conductive media causes the amplitude and phase of an electromagnetic field established in a rock medium surrounding induction array tools to be altered by the properties and boundaries between differing regions of the rock in complex ways. The transmitter coils in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> are designed to create an electromagnetic field that is sensed by the respective receiver coil array <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As appreciated by those of skill in the art appreciate, the amplitude and phase of sinusoidal signals induced in the receiver coils <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>229</bold></highlight> relative to the amplitude and phase of the current flowing in an associated transmitter coil create the data for determining the characteristics of the earth formations under investigation. Thus, the measured amplitude and phase of the voltages in the receiver coil array are measures of the components of the electromagnetic field received by the receiver arrays after passing through the rock medium between the transmitter and receiver. The embodiments of the present invention relate to a system for sensing the subtle local disturbances in rock conductivity at various axial and radial distances from the tool, depending on which transmitter-receiver spacing is employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It is known that the physical phenomenon of &ldquo;skin-effect&rdquo; which has the effect of reducing the penetration of the field into the rock, is proportional to the ratio of the distance into the rock divided by the &ldquo;skin-depth&rdquo; (defined as the inverse of the square-root of the product of the electrical conductivity, the magnetic permeability of a medium, and the frequency). Accordingly, induction array tools <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are sensitive to any variations in these properties as well as the presence of the rock-bed boundaries. Further, the longer transmitter-receiver coil spacing shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> are more affected by variations because the associated electromagnetic fields penetrate deeper into the rock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In general, there are many unknown factors in the rock to be resolved by a limited number of the measurements that are possible with most induction array tools. This problem can be simplified by the choice of measurement frequency that minimizes the skin-effect in high rock conductivity. Doll addressed this situation in U.S. Pat. No. 2,582,314 by teaching that the receiver signal can be considered as a convolution of the elemental rock conductivity&apos;s located in each region surrounding the tool with the relative magnitude of the tool sensitivity in that region. Said convolution is known in the art as the &ldquo;Geometrical Factor Response&rdquo;. Doll also taught methods of de-convolution to remove undesired portions of the spatial response in U.S. Pat. No. 3,166,709. Unfortunately, Doll did not realize the seriousness of the problem of skin-effect which can introduce errors in early tools as large as 50% in the most conductive rocks (e.g. 5 mho/meter), but the problem was later analyzed by Gianzero (&ldquo;A new look at Skin-effect&rdquo; SPWLA 1980). Further, Barber, U.S. Pat. No. 4,513,376 and Strickland and Sinclair, U.S. Pat. No. 5,146,167 derived methods for correcting the skin-effect influence on the spatial response to the tools, but they employed the phase-quadrature component of the received signal (the &ldquo;X&rdquo; signal) that is very sensitive to undesired magnetic permeability factors in the tool environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the invention, skin effect influence is corrected by means of simple mathematical boosting functions. As is known, if a lower transmitter frequency is employed, the skin-effect is reduced in proportion to the square-root of the frequency. The useful signal measured in a receiver is reduced in proportion to the square of frequency for a constant transmitter current, but noise signals are frequency-independent. According to the embodiment, the transmitter coil array and receiver coil array designs shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> mitigate skin effect by allowing operations at significantly lower frequency ranges than known in the prior art. Further, the data collected by an induction array tools <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> permit corrections to the data that can be accurately made using simplified mathematical functions. More particularly, as discussed above, the frequency of the transmitter coils disposed above receiver coil array <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> are scaled substantially inversely according to the square of the effective spacing to the measure point <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. This spacing advantageously sets the amount of residual skin-effect as substantially the same for each different transmitter in homogenous and near homogenous formations. Accordingly, simple and accurate methods of combining the data from the different transmitters refine the spatial response of the induction array tools. Further features of an embodiment that minimize skin effect include the use of magnetic materials described with respect to magnetic core material <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and high coil turns-count with respect to each transmitter and receiver coil. Another very important feature of the reduction in skin-effect is that the spatial response of induction array tools <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> remains approximately constant. Since the data will be analyzed based on a known depth-of-investigation for each transmitter, and an estimate of the depth of invasion of borehole fluids into the rock determined, this feature adds greatly to the confidence placed on these estimates. The same data are often interpreted to find the oil saturation of a reservoir where an independent measure of rock porosity is not available, and these calculations translate into estimates of oil reserves of immense economic value. Clearly, the induction tool provides data that demands a high-degree of confidence in the predictability of the spatial response and in the data accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Additionally, it has been discovered that formation conductivity seldom varies greatly in the radial direction of induction array tools, usually less than one order of magnitude. Accordingly, a reasonable approximation of skin-effect affecting the induction array tools <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> assumes that the skin-effect is identical for each transmitter-receiver combination. Table 3, below, shows an estimate of the fractional skin-effect error in the top end range of homogenous rock formation conductivity for four transmitter coil spacings:

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Both the transmitter coils shown in Tables <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are short-spaced coil arrays designed to respond almost entirely to the borehole region around the tool. Both are operated at a low frequency (4 kHz) to avoid cross-talk from the transmitter into the main receiver coil array <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. The transmitter-receiver pair in each of induction array tools <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> has no significant skin effect even in salt-saturated brine mud at high temperature with conductivity approaching 45 mhos/meter. The spatial response is designed to have a mirror-image character compared to portions of the long-spaced transmitter response close to the axis of the tool in the vicinity of the receiver coil array <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. Subsequent signal processing involving subtraction of all or part of the short-spacing signal from the long-spacing signal, and associated filtering functions applied to data recorded as the tool moves up the borehole, allows substantial elimination of the borehole errors from the long-spaced signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Additionally, each of the borehole compensation coil arrays <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference> employ transmitter coils to, each of which is placed within the receiver coil array <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, thereby avoiding lengthening of the induction array tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> According to a further embodiment, the net borehole response in a uniform borehole diameter is removed by filtering the signal from the borehole compensation coil array <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> as a function of borehole depth to remove transient changes, and using the result as a correction signal to the other longer-spacing arrays from the transmitter coils disposed above the receiver coil array <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>. Methods of filtering using depth as a variable, also known in the art as de-convolution, are also applied to each of the sets of data obtained for each different transmitter spacing for several purposes. The main purpose is to remove the influence of rock beds at a distance along the tool axis on both sides of the measure point. These methods are well known in the art and can be applied to normalize the spatial response of all the arrays to one standard shape, typically a Gaussian function, so that the &ldquo;vertical&rdquo; i.e. axial resolution of the tool is fixed. This process is much simplified due to the greatly reduced skin-effect of the induction array tool. Additionally, according to an embodiment, the residual non-linear errors introduced by skin-effect are corrected by means of de-convolution of the data derived from the in-phase component of received signals to predict the missing skin-effect signal, combined with the original data in simple non-linear boosting function to reconstitute the full signal. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a graphical representation of an embodiment of the invention as compared to a prior art induction logging tool. The prior art induction logging tool representation illustrates problems associated with induction logging tools operated with long-spaced transmitter coils at high frequencies. More particularly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates homogeneous formation conductivity (in mho/meter) along the horizontal axis <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. The vertical axis illustrates the received signal scaled appropriately to be equal to actual conductivity in ideal conditions (apparent conductivity). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Referring to the dashed-line curve <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, a 2-meter spacing and a frequency of 20 KHz is illustrated. As shown, the dashed-line curve <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> increases up to a maximum and then begins to decline. As shown, the declination of curve <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> results in two values of formation conductivity for each apparent conductivity. Thus, the range at which a double reading is possible results in uncertainty in the interpretation of the data. The double reading occurs because the skin-depth in the formation shrinks to a value lower than the transmitter-receiver coil spacing and the received signal becomes increasingly attenuated. Prior art induction logging tools with similar high frequencies resolve the problem of double-valued data by employing the quadrature-signal component (X-signal) which increases in value with conductivity at high conductivity levels. However, X-signal methods suffer from the problem of unwanted mutual-unbalance signals caused by formation or borehole magnetic material near the sensor coils thereby introducing errors. </paragraph>

The horizontal axis <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> represents the diameter in inches of the zone of investigation. The vertical axis <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> is scaled as a dimensionless value of relative response to each radial region of a formation. The combination of characteristic response curves <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> assists in interpreting fluid-invasion effects in cases for which borehole fluid and formation connate fluid conductivity are different but of similar order of magnitude. The minimal effect on the spatial response is shown by the small shift of the dashed-line curves <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> (1 mho/meter formation conductivity), compared to the solid-line curves <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> (0.001 mho/meter) which have negligible skin effect. </paragraph>

Additionally, it will be apparent that the nature of these software filters may be adjusted for various nominal borehole diameters, to provide a more exact removal of the cave errors. At each location of a coil, there is a peak in the magnitude of the spatial response close to the tool axis.

By aligning the positive peaks of the borehole compensation coil array <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> along the axis of the tool with the negative peaks of the long-spaced array (and vice-versa), a total cancellation of the peaks is achieved when the signals from each array are subtracted. In this manner, the influence of transient changes in borehole diameter may also be removed as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
