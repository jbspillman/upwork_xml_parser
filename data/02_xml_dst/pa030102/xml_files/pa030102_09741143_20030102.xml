<section>
<heading lvl="1">RELATED APPLICATIONS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application is a continuation of International Application Number PCT/EP99/04129, filed Jun. 15, 1999, which in turn claims priority from German Patent Application No. 198 30 618.0, filed Jul. 9, 1998, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The use of resistant starches (RS) is of increasing importance for the food Industry. The breakdown of RS products only produces a small amount of energy for the organism. This energy supply is related solely to the oxidative breakdown of absorbed short-chain fatty acids from the large intestine. These short-chain fatty acids are end products of the carbohydrate metabolism of the intestinal microflora. Two functions are linked with the intake of RS-containing foods: provision of substrate for energy metabolism of the intestinal microflora and for that of the large intestine epithelial cells. The latter, to maintain their structure and function, are dependent on a luminal feed of short-chain fatty acids, in particular butyrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It has long been known that the content of highly branched amylopectin in starches, which usually consist of amylose and amylopectin of varying composition, can be reduced by specific enzymatic treatment, as a result of which the content of short-chain amylose structures can be increased (U.S. Pat. No. 3,729,380). It is also known that such products have a greater tendency to retrogradation than native starches. In this process, &agr;-amylase-resistant starch structures develop. Resistant starches (RS) are carbohydrate polymers which are not broken down by &agr;-amylase. As a result they are a reduced-energy component providing body in food compositions, within the meaning of a dietary fiber. For technical reasons, the treatment with debranching enzymes usually takes place in a not-too-concentrated aqueous starch gel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> EP 0 564 893 A1 describes and claims a process for producing an RS product which contains up to 15% RS. This process is characterized in that the aqueous suspension of a starch which contains at least 40% amylose is gelatinized and enzymatically debranched by treatment with an enzyme which opens the &agr;-1,6-glycosidic bonds, and the resultant intermediate product is then retrograded. According to EP 0 564 893 A1, the optimum starch concentration in the suspension is 15% and the examples of this EP patent application illustrate the process when the starch concentrations are either reduced to 14% or increased to 17%. The starting material contains at least 40% amylose and Is a corn starch. It is further shown that at an amylose content of 25%, no resistant starch (RS) is formed by this process. In addition, it was found that when the amylose content is increased above 40% to up to 100%, a product can be generated which contains up to 50.3% RS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> EP 0 688 872 A1 describes and claims a process for producing an RS-containing product which contains from 25 to 50% by weight of RS. According to the specifications, EP 0 688 872 A1 describes and claims a process for producing an RS-containing product in which an aqueous suspension of a partially degraded gelatinized starch is enzymatically debranched and the intermediate product is retrograded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (In this context, &ldquo;partially degraded starch&rdquo; is taken to mean a polymer whose molecular weight has been decreased by suitable treatment, the shortening of the chain length affecting both the amylose and the amylopectin. The degradation includes not only hydrolytic processes (acids or enzyme-catalyzed) but also extrusion, oxidation or pyrolysis). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Acid-degraded root or tuber starches and maltodextrins of root or tuber starches are particularly emphasized. Maltodextrins are characterized by a DE value (DE: dextrose equivalent) in the range from 1 to 19. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> They are produced from potato starch or tapioca starch which contain up to 25% amylose, The aqueous suspension of such maltodextrins has a solids content of 20% by weight or more for the process. The maltodextrins are further characterized in that they have high contents of oligomers having degrees of polymerization less than 10 (DP&lt;10) of up to 22% by weight and a mean molecular weight of 1.3680&times;10 g/mol. The debranching enzymes which are used for the known process are pullulanase and isoamylase. At the end of the enzymatic treatment, retrogradation in a temperature range from 0 to 30&deg; C. is carried out in a time period of from 1 to 3 days, by allowing the aqueous reaction product to stand. The product is then dried by spray-drying. A pulverulent product having an RS content up to a maximum of 60% by weight is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The inventive description serves the purpose of producing economically carbohydrate polymers having a high content of resistant, relatively thermally stable structures in order to be able to use them in food manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Thus one embodiment of the invention relates to &agr;-amylase-resistant polysaccharides which are poly(1,4-&agr;-D-glucans), characterized in that they have an RS content of at least 65% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In connection with the present invention, an RS content is taken to mean the content of &agr;-amylase-resistant polysaccharides, as can be determined by the method of Englyst et al. (Classification and measurement of nutritionally important starch Fractions, European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 46 (Suppl. 23) (1992) 33-50); see also example 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The inventive &agr;-amylase-resistant polysaccharides can be characterized by an RS content of at least 75, and in particular at least 95% by weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In addition, the inventive &agr;-amylase-resistant polysaccharides can be characterized in that the poly(1,4-&agr;-D-glucans) are chemically modified in a manner known per se. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thus, the poly(1,4-&agr;-D-glucans) can have been chemically modified by etherification or esterification in the 2, 3 or 6 position. Those skilled in the art have long been familiar with chemical modification; see, for example, the following references: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In addition, the &agr;-amylase-resistant polysaccharides can be characterized in that the poly(1,4&agr;-D-glucans) have a molecular weight of from 0.75&times;10<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>7</superscript></highlight>, preferably from 10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>to 10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>, and preferably from 10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>to 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>g/mol and/or are water-insoluble. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In addition, the inventive &agr;-amylase-resistant polysaccharides can be characterized in that the poly(1,4-&agr;-D-glucans) have neither been debranched, in particular have neither been enzymatically debranched, nor have been reduced with respect to their chain length (and thus with respect to their molecular weight), in particular not by enzyme catalysis, acid catalysis, extrusion, oxidation or pyrolysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In addition, the inventive &agr;-amylase-resistant polysacchardes can be obtainable by a process comprising the following steps: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> a) producing a suspension or dispersion from water-insoluble poly(1,4-&agr;-D-glucans) and water; </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> c) cooling the resultant gel and retrogradation of the gel at a temperature which is lower than the temperature of the heated gel; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> d) if appropriate drying the resultant product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;water-insoluble&rdquo; is taken to mean compounds which, according to the definition of the Deutsches Arzneimittelbuch &lsqb;German pharmacopoeia&rsqb; (Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft/Stuttgart &amp; Gori-Verlag/Frankfurt, 9<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>edition, 1987; see also examples 22 to 23), come under the category of &ldquo;sparingly soluble&rdquo; compounds, &ldquo;very sparingly soluble&rdquo; or &ldquo;virtually insoluble&rdquo; compounds. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In addition, the inventive &agr;-amylase-resistant polysaccharides can be obtainable by a process comprising the following steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> a) producing a suspension or dispersion from water-insoluble poly(1,4-&agr;-D-glucans) and water; </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The advantage of the inventive process can be that, from the above-described starting materials, an aqueous hot gel can be produced which has solid contents up to, for example, 30% by weight or more, without, for example, debranching or partial degradation or a chain-length reduction of the starting materials used needing to be performed. This leads to a simplification of the process sequence and thus to a reduction in the costs of the process, because the time-consuming and costly use of debranching enzymes or degrading chemicals is avoided. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> 200 mg (dry weight) of a pulveruent product to be analyzed for its RS content were incubated at pH 5.2 for 120 min to determine the RS content using the enzyme mixture described, according to the method of Englyst et al. (Eur. J. Clin. Nutrition, 46 (1992) (Suppl. 2) pp. 33-550). After termination of the enzymatic degradation, the enzyme activity was stopped by reducing the pH to a value of 3 and the temperature to 20&deg; C. Then, by adding 4 times the amount of ethanol, the mixture was adjusted to an 80% (v/v) ethanolic solution. The 80% ethanolic solution was allowed to stand for 1 h at room temperature. The precipitate was centrifuged (2500&times; g, 10 min) and the supernatant was discarded. The residue was washed three times with 80% (v/v) ethanol and once with absolute ethanol and centrifuged. The residue was lyophilized and weighed. The dry mass of the residue was determined and the RS content calculated from the following equation: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> This example in table 2 shows that the retrogradation temperature affects the RS content.

In contrast, retrogradation at &minus;70&deg; C. produces a slightly higher RS content than retrogradation at 4&deg; C.

The instrument operates according to the heat flux measurement principle. Per measurement, 5 mg of polyglucan were weighed using an ultramicrobalance into silver crucibles of 70 &mgr;l capacity and these were then hermetically sealed after addition of distilled water.

<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> These examples in table 4 show that the solids content in the gel affects the thermal stability of the retrograded products. Thus retrogradation at 30 % solids content in the gel leads to products which exhibit endotherms having more than one peak in DSC measurements, with peak temperatures (T<highlight><subscript>p</subscript></highlight>) of &gt;120&deg; C. occurring in these endotherms. In contrast, retrogradation of 10% gel leads to products whose endotherms only have peak with T<highlight><subscript>p </subscript></highlight>values between 95 and 100&deg; C. Increasing the solids content in the gel thus increases the thermal stability of the retrograded product. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> 564 mg of poly(1,4-&agr;-glucan) (see example 1) are heated in approximately 0.5 l of twice-distilled water at 1.3 bar and 130&deg; C. for 1.5 hours in an autoclave (<highlight><italic>Certoclav apparatus</italic></highlight>). The weight of the reaction vessel has been measured in advance. The apparatus is then depressurized and cooled at room temperature. The contents are weighed. This corresponds to 501.74 g. After a further 24 hours, the contents are centrifuged and decanted. The solid residue is dried and weighed. There are 468 mg. A dissolved portion of 96 mg is calculated from this. Based on the solvent used, it is calculated therefrom that 5226 mg of water are necessary for 1 mg of poly(1 ,4-&agr;-D-glucan). According to the classification of the DAB, this classifies the substance as &ldquo;very sparingly soluble&rdquo;, since between 1000 and 10000 parts of solvent are necessary to dissolve 1 part of the substance. This is class number 6 of the 7 classes for classifying solubility (from &ldquo;very highly soluble&rdquo; (class 1) to &ldquo;virtually insoluble&rdquo; (class 7)). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The experiment is carried out as in Example 22. The sole difference is the cooling process which is provided downstream of the autoclave treatment and cooling to room temperature. The substance mixture is kept at 5&deg; C. for 3 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> 526 mg of poly(1.4-&agr;-D-glucan) are weighed into approximately 480 ml of twice-distilled water. After the thermal treatment, a weight of 468.09 g results. The dried sediment is 488 mg. Therefore, 39 mg of the poly(1,4-&agr;-glucan) have dissolved. This corresponds to a ratio of 1 mg of substance to 12 305 parts of solvent. Therefore, the substance according to this treatment method must be classified in class number 7 according to DAB and therefore as virtually insoluble, because more than 10 000 of solvent are required for one part of substance. </paragraph>
