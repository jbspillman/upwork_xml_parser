<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Proposed are a laser-diode assembly with external Bragg grating for narrow-bandwidth light and a method of narrowing linewidth of the spectrum. A laser-diode assembly comprises a light source in the form of a semiconductor laser diode coupled via a first microoptical coupling device to one end of a first optical fiber. The other end of this fiber is coupled to a second or an output fiber via a second microoptical coupling device. The assembly is characterized by the fact that a laser cavity is extended rearward from the back facet of the laser diode and that the Bragg grating is located in the extended part of the cavity, so that the Bragg grating fulfills three functions, i.e., narrowing of the linewidth, frequency stabilization, and reflection of a portion of light to the resonator chamber. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of optoelectronics, in particular, to laser-diode units for generating a frequency-stabilized narrow-bandwidth light. The invention also relates to a method of generating a stabilized narrow-bandwidth light of a selected frequency. The invention may find application in various fields where short wavelength compact lasers are used, such as flat-panel displays, projection displays, optical data readers, optical sensors, laser measurement systems, optical data storage, etc. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> At the present time, lasers find wide application in various fields. Especially in the recent years a tendency is observed for replacement of traditional solid-state and gas lasers with semiconductor lasers in view of their smaller dimensions, simplicity of use, and low cost. It is understood that such replacement is possible only if the replacement laser diodes possess at least the same properties with regard to the bandwidth characteristics and frequency stability as those in the lasers to be replaced. Semiconductor lasers with the above characteristics may find use in such fields as optical emission spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence analysis, transmission-absorption analysis, reflectometry, elipsometry, polarimetry, interferometry, Raman scattering analysis, non-linear optical diagnostics, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One essential characteristic of a spectrum of light emitted by a semiconductor laser diodes is a linewidth, What is understood under the term &ldquo;linewidth&rdquo; in the context of the present patent application is the width of the light spectrum at the half of the height of the intensity-wavelength curve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is known that narrow linewidth sources are essential for optical systems such as coherent optical communications and optical sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Attempts have been made to narrow the linewidth in distributed feedback or distributed Bragg reflector semiconductor lasers. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,075,805 issued to A. Cook, et al. in June 2000, describes an apparatus for linewidth reduction in distributed feedback or distributed Bragg reflector semiconductor lasers using vertical emission. According to the above patent, the linewidth of a distributed feedback semiconductor laser or a distributed Bragg reflector laser having one or more second order gratings is reduced by using an external cavity to couple the vertical emission back into the laser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The authors of U.S. Pat. No. 6,075,805 state that use of an extended laser cavity in the direction that coincides with the optical axis of the laser diode would deteriorate the main laser beam because of interference of the beam reflected back to the laser cavity with the main light beam. The authors offer to solve this problem by utilizing an extension of the cavity, which is branched laterally from the optical axis direction. This is done by means of a Bragg grating formed on the active medium of the laser diode. This statement, however, is true for conventionally produced laser diode systems of non-microoptical type which have coatings on the rear and front faces of the laser diode with reflectivity of about 5%. It is understood that with 5% reflectivity the aforementioned reflectivity would be significant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the inventor&apos;s opinion, the proposed method and device prevent disturbance of the laser beam of main interest, provide unobstructed access to laser emission for the formation of the external cavity, and do not require a very narrow heat sink. Any distributed Bragg reflector semiconductor laser or distributed feedback semiconductor laser that can produce a vertical emission through the epitaxial material and through a window in the top metallization can be used. The external cavity can be formed with an optical fiber or with a lens and a mirror or grating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It should also be noted with regard to the statement of U.S. Pat. No. 6,075,805 that the device and method described in this patent relate to laser cavities with relatively large ratios of the laser cavity length to the light beam diameter. In other words, the geometry inherent in the optical system of U.S. Pat. No. 6,075,805, as well as in other systems of this type, causes significant problems in optical alignment of the system components. This problem is aggravated in microoptical systems where the problems of optical alignment are especially critical and cannot be solved by conventional methods. Therefore, the device and method of U.S. Pat. No. 6,075,805 are not applicable to microoptical systems, especially to those, which are to be produced commercially. Furthermore, the heat sinks described and shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,075,805 are too narrow and therefore would not be optically stable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The above problem was partially solved in a device described in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. ______ filed by the applicant of the present patent Application on ______ The device of this patent application describes a laser-diode assembly based on implementation of microoptical components for generating a frequency-stabilized narrow-bandwidth light. The device comprises a light source in the form of a semiconductor laser diode coupled via a first microoptical coupling device to one end of a first optical fiber. The other end of this fiber is coupled to a second or an output fiber via a second microoptical coupling device. The assembly is characterized by the fact that a long inner cavity is formed by a section of the optical system between two oppositely directed mirrors within the boundary of the device housing. The first mirror, which is almost 100% reflective, is applied onto the back side of the semiconductor laser diode, and the second mirror is applied onto a flat front side of one optical microlens element or onto the back side of another optical microlens element. These optical microlens elements are parts of an optical coupling between the first and the second fibers. The first mirror completely reflects the entire light incident onto this mirror, whereas the second mirror reflects a major part of the light, e.g., about 90% and passes only a small part, e.g., 10% of the light incident onto this mirror. The Bragg grating is designed so that, in combination with the laser cavity L, it suppresses the side modes of the wavelength bands and transforms them into the central mode of the narrow wavelength band which can be passed through this grating. The light processed by the Bragg grating is passed through the second mirror to the output fiber, while the reflected light performs multiple cycles of reflection between both mirrors which thus form a laser resonator which amplifies the laser light output at the selected narrow waveband. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Although the device described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. ______ is advantageous in that it provides a frequency-stabilized semiconductor laser assembly with a narrow linewidth of the light spectrum, the length of the laser cavity is limited to the boundaries of the device housing where both mirror are installed. Furthermore, the system of the aforementioned patent application uses for optimization of the gain in the semiconductor laser only one coating with about 1% reflection in the feedback beam. The second facet is closed with a fully-reflective mirror. Such a construction is difficult to produce, assemble, and adjust. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another disadvantage is that the device of the aforementioned patent application requires the use of two different components, each for its specific function, i.e., a mirror for reflecting and Bragg grating for frequency selection and stabilization. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to provide a laser-diode device, which is characterized by a very narrow linewidth in a spectrum of light of a selected wavelength. Another object is to provide a laser-diode device with an increased output signal/noise ratio, increased output light power at a selected narrow wavelength band, and stabilized frequency at the output. Another object is to provide a laser-diode device suitable for use in microoptical systems with possibility of efficient assembling and alignment under mass production conditions. Still another object is to provide a method of stabilizing frequency and narrowing the linewidth of the spectrum of the light emitted from the laser device through external extended laser cavity. Another object of the invention is to simplify the construction, assembling and adjustment by combining the functions of frequency stabilization, wavelength selection, and partial light reflection for maximizing the gain of the system in one optical component, which is a Bragg grating. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&mdash;Embodiment of the Invention with External Bragg Grating in Conjunction with a Laser Diode </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A laser-diode assembly of the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which is a longitudinal sectional view. The assembly as a whole is supported by a rectangular housing H, which has a longitudinal rectangular groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which is a sectional view along the line II-II of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The housing H is connected to a heat sink <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which may have an electric control (not shown). This groove serves for placement and centering of the components of the device. A unit, which in general is designated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, consists of two lens elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a spacer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> sandwiched between them. This unit constitutes an anamorphotic lens assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in the illustrated embodiment the groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a rectangular cross section and a width that ensures gap-free fit of the optical system components, including the anamorphotic lens assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In such positions the aforementioned components are aligned with the optical axis of the laser diode assembly. The parts that form the lens assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are connected into an integral unit, e.g., by gluing with a UV-curable epoxy glue. If necessary, they can be connected by thermal fusion. The flatness and parallelism of the end faces, as well as the aforementioned dimensions of the components that form the lens assembly ensure self-alignment and self-centering of the components during assembling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Each lens element comprises a rectangular, e.g., square plate made of glass, quartz, or any other suitable optical material having flat and strictly parallel front and rear sides or end faces and a cylindrical aspherical lens on the mating front sides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Shown on the left side of the anamorphotic lens assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a laser diode unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is mounted on a ceramic support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> mounted on the housing H. The laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is supported so that the center of its emitter <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is located on the optical axis Z-Z of the lens assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. An example of such a laser diode is a <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> nm single-mode edge-emitter type laser diode produced by Perkin Elmer Co. The laser diode of this type has a 1 &mgr;m&times;3 &mgr;m edge emitter. Another example is a laser diode of produced by Hitachi Co., Ltd. for radiating light with the wavelength of 635 nm. In fact, the principle of the invention is applicable to lasers of any types and designs that emit light with wavelengths in the range of 400 to 1600 nm. For example, the technology of the present invention also applicable to diodes of a VCSEL type with emitters on a vertical cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of the housing H, which supports all the aforementioned components, functions as an aligning and centering element, as well as a temperature-stabilizing/heat sinking chassis of the laser diode chip and the optical assembly. The spacer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> has a round cross section. The diameter of this round cross section is equal to the width of the groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The lens element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>) comprises a plate with an aspherical cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on the front end face <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that faces the lens element <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the lens element <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> comprises a square plate with an aspherical cylindrical lens <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on the front end face <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that faces the lens element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The backside, e.g., the end face <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the lens element <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is strictly parallel to the end face <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of this element. The aspherical cylindrical lenses <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> have their longitudinal axes respectively, turned by 90&deg; relative to each other. In the illustrated embodiment, the lenses <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are made integrally with the plate-like bodies of the lens elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, respectively, e.g., by chemical etching. If necessary, however, they can be produced by cutting a cylindrical body in a longitudinal direction and then gluing the half-cylinders to the end faces of the plates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The spacer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is a ring-like element with a central hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and two strictly parallel and flat end faces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The reason that all aforementioned end faces should be strictly parallel to each other is that they function as reference surfaces for assembling. Their surface condition should ensure that deviation of the lenses <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> from parallelism does not exceed 2 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A distance R (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) from the emitter of the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the lens element <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is within the range of 1 to 100 &mgr;m. The shortened distance between the emitter of the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the lens element improves optical coupling efficiency, as compared to the TO-can mounting where this distance is relatively large. It is important to ensure divergence of the optical beam OB<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponding to the input aperture of the anamorphotic lens assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for full optical coupling of the optical components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The optical lenses <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> have the same length in the direction of their respective longitudinal axes and this length has a magnitude that ensures gap-free snug fit of the lenses <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the hole <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the spacer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> when the unit is assembled by sandwiching the spacer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> between the lens elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the parts are secured together, e.g., by an optical glue, e.g., a UV-cured NOA-61 epoxy-type adhesive. Alternatively, the parts can be secured together by means of laser welding, such as glass-to-glass YAG laser welding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Located on the side of the anamorphotic lens assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> opposite to the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a glass ferrule <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> with a central opening <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and end faces <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The ferrule <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is also positioned in the groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The external diameter of the ferrule <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is equal to that of the spacer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and therefore the ferrule <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is also self-centered in the groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The end face <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the glass ferrule <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is strictly parallel to the end face <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the lens element <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with deviation from flatness of less than 1 &mgr;m. An optical fiber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is inserted into the central opening <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> so that its front end face <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has a butt connection with the rear end face <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> via a thin layer <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of a UV-curable optically matched epoxy glue (such as NOA-61 type adhesive) which is used for attaching the ferrule <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> as well as the end face <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to the end face <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the lens element <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which is a fragmental sectional view on a larger scale illustrating the butt connection of the fiber with the end face of the lens element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The glue layer has a thickness of about 4-5 &mgr;m. The butt connection of the fiber to the flat side of the lens element ensures automatic positioning of the fiber in the device and thus simplicity and repeatability of such positioning under conditions of mass production. It is understood that reference numeral <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> designates both the core and the clad of the optical fiber, which are not designated separately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It is obvious that the optical axes of the fiber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the anamorphotic lens assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are strictly linear and coincident in all these components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The flat surface <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) of the lens element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, including the lens <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the flat surface <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the lens element <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, including the lens <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> have anti-reflective coatings (only one of which, i.e., the coating layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> on the flat surface <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). This coating <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is index-matched with a glue layer <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, e. g., a NOA-61 optical epoxy layer shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which may have a maximum thickness of about 4-5 &mgr;m. This improves optical coupling of the lens to the fiber and eliminates mechanical mismatch that may be caused by thermal deformations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The end of the fiber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> opposite to the lens assembly <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is inserted into a ferrule <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of another optical coupler <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), which connects the fiber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> with an output optical fiber <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. As can be seen from this drawing, the ferrule <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has a through opening <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The end of the fiber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is inserted into one end of this opening, while an aspheric circular microlens <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of a plate-like microlens is inserted with a tight fit into the opposite end of the opening <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The microlens element <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is glued to the mating end face <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the ferrule <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> with a layer <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of a UV-curable glue. The aforementioned end of the fiber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is located a certain distance from the aforementioned aspheric circular microlens <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. This distance ensures formation of a collimated light beam OB<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a tubular separator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> which is mentioned below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> When the fiber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is fixed in the ferrule <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> by a layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of a UV-curable glue, the fiber end face should be in an exact location with respect to the microlens <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. If necessary, the exact positioning and fixation of the fiber end face can be facilitated by using an additional ferrule <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and a layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the glue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The flat end face of the microlens element <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is coated with a mirror coating M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which passes only a fraction, e.g., about 10% of a selected narrow wavelength band of light incident on this mirror coating and reflects the remaining 90% of the selected wavelengths band of light through the fiber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> back toward the laser. The 10%/90% ratio may vary to suit specific application and a desired power spectrum relation. For example, for red light the selected band may be of 635 nm&plusmn;0.4 nm. The semiconductor laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be, e.g., the one that generates light in the spectrum band of 635 nm&plusmn;12.5 nm (semiconductor laser diodes produced by Hitachi, Sony, Toshiba, Phillips, etc.). The mirror M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> will reflect approximately 100% of light except for the portion that corresponds to the wavelength of 635 nm&plusmn;0.4 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The flat rear end face of the microlens element <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is glued via a layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of a UV-curable glue to the front end face of the aforementioned tubular separator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having a central opening <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of a diameter larger than the diameter of the fiber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The flat front end face of another plate-like microlens element <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is glued via a layer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of a UV-curable glue to the rear end face of a ferrule <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. A circular aspheric microlens <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, which is formed on the flat front side of the microlens element <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> inserted into a through opening <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of the ferrule <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. An output optical fiber <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of the entire system is inserted into the end of the opening <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, which is opposite to the fiber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The end face of the fiber <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> should be located at a predetermined distance from the lens <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. In a real construction, positioning and fixation of end faces of respective fibers <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are carried out so as to obtaining the maximum output light signal in the fiber <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Located on the left side of the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an optical component of the system, which contains an extension unit <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the laser cavity L that is described later. By definition from Photonics Dictionary published in <highlight><bold>1993</bold></highlight> by the Publisher of Photonic Spectra Magazine, a laser cavity is an optical resonant structure, in which lasing activity begins when multiple reflections accumulate electromagnetic field intensity. It is difficult, however, to define a laser cavity in an optical system, which has many reflecting surfaces, which limit the area with lasing activity. Therefore, in the present patent application we define the laser cavity as a space from the mirror M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the laser cavity extension unit <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> consists of a second anamorphotic objective <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> formed by a pair of microlens elements <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> with a spacer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> between them. The second anamorphotic objective has the same construction and arrangement of parts as the first anamorphotic objective <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> described above. In other words, its end faces are flat and parallel to each other and are treated to a high degree of flatness in order to provide self-alignment and accurate coaxiality with the optical axis of the system during assembling. Similar to the fiber support and positioning system of the previously described couplings, the unit <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> has a cylindrical ferrule <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, which is centered in the groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the housing H coaxially with the rest of the optical system components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A locking optical fiber <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> is inserted into a central through opening <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the ferrule <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and is butt-connected to the flat rear end face <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the microlens element <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> with the butt connection described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. A cylindrical aspherical microlens <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the microlens element <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is snuggly fitted into the central opening <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the spacer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a cylindrical aspherical microlens <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, which has its longitudinal axis perpendicular to that of the microlens <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, is snuggly fitted into the opening <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the spacer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> from the side opposite to the microlens element <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In fact, the assembly consisting of the microlens elements <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, spacer <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, and the ferrule <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is identical to the assembly of microlens elements <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, etc., which is mirror-image construction of the assembly locate on the left side from the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The left-side assembly has the same antireflective coatings and UV-curable glue layers as the right-side assembly, and therefore their description is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the locking fiber <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> has a Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> written into the core of the optical fiber. The position of the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> depends on a specific design and can be anywhere along the length of the locking fiber <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. The applicant has successfully tested laser-diode assemblies of the invention with the different lengths of the fiber <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> within the range of 2 cm to 20 cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The free end of the locking fiber, behind the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, is supported by a ferrule <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. It is understood that all ferrules <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, as well as the spacers <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> have the same diameters, which are equal to the width of the groove <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the housing H. This ensures self-centering and alignment of the fiber-supporting elements and, hence, of the fibers themselves in the optical system of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the portion of the locking fiber <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> from the Bragg grating to the butt connection with the anamorphotic objective <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, the objective <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> itself, the space between the anamorphotic objective <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the rear end of the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> itself, the space between the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the anamorphotic objective <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the anamorphotic objective <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> itself, the entire optical fiber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, and the distance from the front end of the fiber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to the mirror coating M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the flat end face of the lens element <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> form an extended laser cavity L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It can be seen that in contrast to the laser cavity L of the system disclosed in the earlier U.S. patent application Ser. No. ______, light source, i.e., the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is an intercavity element, which is located between the Bragg grating on one side and the laser mirror M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the other side. This means that the length of the laser cavity can be extended to a much greater degree than in the previously described construction. Another advantage is that there is no need to form a full-reflection mirror on the back facet of laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or another source such as a semiconductor amplifier, or a superluminescent emitting diode. This is an important advantage since the laser diode works in an intensive temperature and light-power density mode which require that for reliability of operation the mirror coating on the laser be produced with an extremely high quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the system of the present invention, the function of the aforementioned full-reflection mirror of the system, described in the aforementioned U.S. patent application, is fulfilled by the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Along with the function of the full-reflection mirror, the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> selects the linewidth and ensures optical power stability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Bragg gratings are also known as distributed Bragg reflectors, which are optical fibers or other media that have been modified by modulating the longitudinal index of refraction of the fiber core, cladding or both to form a pattern. A fiber equipped with Bragg grating functions to modify the optical passband of the fiber (transmission characteristic) in such a way as to only transmits a narrow and controlled wavelength band. The distributed Bragg reflectors typically are &ldquo;lossless&rdquo; devices. In principle, the Bragg gratings can be used as light reflectors or as spectrum shape or mode converters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A typical distributed Bragg reflector comprises a length of optical fiber including a plurality of perturbations in the index of refraction substantially equally spaced along the fiber length. These perturbations selectively reflect light of wavelength &lgr; equal to twice the spacing A between successive perturbations times the effective refractive index, i.e., &lgr;&equals;2n<highlight><subscript>eff </subscript></highlight>&Lgr;, where &lgr; is the vacuum wavelength and n<highlight><subscript>eff </subscript></highlight>is the effective refractive index of the fiber for the mode being propagated. The remaining wavelengths pass essentially unimpeded. In the system of my invention, such a distributed Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is used as a spectrum shape and mode converter for narrowing the spectrum bandwidth of the light radiated from the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as well as for stabilization of the output laser diode characteristics and for gaining the light energy which is resonated within the laser cavity L. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> By selecting an appropriate periodic spacing &Lgr; between successive perturbations in the fiber <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> with the distributed Bragg grating reflector <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, it becomes possible to select a mode, which is the most efficient for the operation of the semiconductor laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the system of the invention, such a mode is the one with the maximum intensity in the laser radiation spectrum. At the same time, the gain of the maximum intensity mode is accompanied by the suppression of the side modes of the spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Although only one antireflective coating <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is shown on the end face <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), anti-reflective coatings (not shown) can be applied onto the end faces of optical fiber <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, of the microlens elements <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The optical system shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> operates as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> After the semiconductor laser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is activated, a diverged light beam, e.g., of 635 nm&plusmn;12.5 nm wavelength emitted by the laser <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, propagates in both directions, i.e., toward the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and toward the output optical fiber <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The photons which propagate toward the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) propagate through the anamorphotic objective <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and are turned into a focused beam, which is coupled into the optical fiber <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. On its way, the light enters the distributed Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, which reflects the wavelength in the selected narrow bandwidth. A portion of the selected mode spectrum is reflected back to the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Immediately after initiation of the light-generation operation (fractions of nanoseconds), the system is self-adjusted to a mode operation in which the spectrum of the generated light will be readjusted to the narrow linewidth mode which will be further maintained due to operation of the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In other words, the photons reflected from the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> will propagate toward the mirror M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. After initiation of the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the process takes few cycles of photon reflections back and forth between the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the mirror M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (the cavity length), whereby the laser cavity enables light amplifications, i.e., gain for the selected wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The intensified light of the selected mode then enters the microlens <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the microlens element <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and passes to the lens element <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> via the mirror M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and through the opening <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the spacer <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the microlens element <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. The mirror M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> passes only a portion, e.g., 75-99%, of the light in the selected wavelength band, e.g., of 635&plusmn;0.4 nm, to the output fiber <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The remaining portion of the light, e.g. 1 to 25%, is reflected back to the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> via the aforementioned optical elements of the laser cavity L. In the case of the system of the invention, the optimum conditions were achieved at back reflection of 15-25%. When this reflected light enters the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the process of spectrum transformation and intensification of light of a selected wavelength with suppression of side modes is repeated. Thus, if 1% of the light is reflected back for use in maximization of the gain of the laser system, this relatively weak feedback beam will not interfere with the main beam of the interest. In one of the designs tested by the applicant, the maximum gain was obtained when the emitter of the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> was coated with a coating having reflectivity below 1%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the photons which are emitted from the laser diode in the direction opposite to the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, in the direction of the output optical fiber <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, first pass through the lens element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the microlens <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of which focuses this beam on the end face of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The focused beam is then propagates through the optical fiber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> towards the mirror M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which effects this beam toward the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. On its way to the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> the light beam is processed in the order reversed to steps in the direction of the mirror M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The rest of the processing of this portion of the light beam which has initially been propagated towards the mirror M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is the same as has been described with regard to the light beam initially directed from the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the Bragg grating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Such an arrangement makes it possible to maintain high level of light radiation power on the selected frequency, which in the illustrated embodiment is the frequency of 635&plusmn;0.4 nm. In combination with temperature control via a heat sink <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, it becomes possible to ensure long-term stability of the output light power with deviations not exceeding, e.g., 1%, or even lower than 0.1%. Furthermore, the laser cavity with the external Bragg grating <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> may have an extremely long dimension, as compared to the length of a semiconductor diode chip. This allows not only obtaining of an extremely narrow linewidth, but also high stability of the frequency which is typical of laser systems with large external resonators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The system of the invention has a simplified construction, assembling and adjustment by utilizing a three-functional component, which is the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. These functions are frequency stabilization, narrowing of the line width, and partial light reflection for maximizing the gain of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>&mdash;Embodiment of the Laser-diode Assembly with External Laser Cavity and Reflecting Mirror on the Front Facet of the Laser Diode </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The embodiment of the invention shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is advantageous in that it allows the use not only a custom-designed laser but also a commercially produced light source. However, further simplification of the construction with elimination of one of optical couplings and one of optical fibers can be accomplished by means of an embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. This embodiment, in general, is similar to that shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and differs from it by eliminating the output optical fiber <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and the optical coupling (<highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>). In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the parts identical to those of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are designated by the same reference numerals with an addition of a prime. An additional reference numeral <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>&prime; designates a rear end face of the microoptical lens element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>&prime;. Furthermore, the reflecting mirror M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is transferred to the front facet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; of the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime;. The function of the output fiber <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is transferred to a fiber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>&prime;. In compliance with the principle of the present invention, the laser diode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; remains between the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>&prime; of the cavity extension fiber <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>&prime; and the reflecting mirror M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&prime;. The length of the laser cavity L&prime; can be chosen without limitations, as in the previous embodiment. The principle of operation also remains the same and therefore is skipped from the description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>&mdash;Embodiment of the Invention with the Reflecting Mirror on the Rear End Face of the Microlens Element of the Device for Coupling the Laser Diode to the Output Optical Fiber </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrate an embodiment of the invention which is similar to one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> but differs from it only by the position of the reflecting mirror. Since both embodiments are very similar, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> the parts identical to those of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are designated by the same reference numerals but with two primes. For example, the laser cavity L&prime; of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> corresponds in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> to the laser cavity L&prime;. Furthermore, the description of the identical parts and of their operation is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The main distinction of the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> from the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is that the reflecting mirror M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&Prime; is formed on the back end face <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>&Prime; of the microoptical lens element <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>&Prime;. Thus, the laser cavity L&Prime; is formed between the Bragg grating <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>&Prime; and the reflecting mirror M<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&Prime;. The operation of the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is the same as of the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Thus it has been shown that the invention provides a laser-diode device, which is characterized by a very narrows linewidth in a spectrum of light of a selected wavelength, an increased output signal/noise ratio, increased output light power at a selected narrow wavelength band, and stabilized frequency at the output. The device of the invention is suitable for use in microoptical systems with possibility of efficient assembling and alignment under mass production conditions. The invention also provides a method of stabilizing frequency and narrowing the linewidth of the spectrum of the light emitted from the laser device through external extended laser cavity. The invention simplifies the construction, assembling and adjustment by combining the functions of frequency stabilization, wavelength selection, and partial light reflection for maximizing the gain of the system in one optical component, which is a Bragg grating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Although the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, it is understood that these embodiments were given only for illustrative purposes and that any changes and modifications with regard to shapes, designs, materials, and combinations thereof are possible, provided these changes and modifications do not depart from the scope of the patent claims. For example, the light source may comprise a superluminescent laser diode, a laser diode with an amplifier, etc. The housing H can be divided into two separate parts, one for the laser unit with the first coupling and anamorphotic lens assembly, and another one with the second coupling and the output fiber. This will allow individual temperature control optimal for separate units. The connection of the optical elements can be achieved by thermal fusion, rather than by adhesion. The mirror and the Bragg grating can be located in positions different from those described and shown in the illustrated embodiments, e.g., the first mirror can be installed on a separate support behind the semiconductor laser diode and at a distance from this diode. </paragraph>
