<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">This invention relates to the identification and characterization of the maize HSP22 protein including the corresponding nucleic acid molecules, nucleic acid fragments and protein fragments. Further, this invention relates to both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to HSP22 and the production thereof. These antibodies can be used in a method for detecting the presence of HSP22 expression in whole leaf samples. Further, the nucleic acid molecule and fragments thereof can be used in assays to detect the levels of nucleic acid molecules involved in HSP22 expression. The levels of both HSP22 and HSP22 mRNA are then utilized as an indication of a plant&apos;s ability to tolerate heat stress. Additionally, plants can be transformed to express increased levels of HSP22. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The effect of environmental stress on agronomic plants has been a major focus of plant research. Plant productivity is related to the ability of plants to respond to and adapt to environmental stress (Sachs and Ho 1986). The proteins produced by higher plants in response to stress have been well-characterized (Key et al., 1981; Cooper and Ho, 1983; Sachs and Ho, 1986). Many stress proteins have recently been found to be chaperones, a class of proteins involved in the folding of newly synthesized proteins (Ellis and van der Vies, 1991; Gething and Sambrook, 1992; Craig et al., 1993). The chaperones have been proposed to function during stress in binding partially denatured proteins, thus preventing their degradation. Additionally, the chaperones assist in the refolding of these partially denatured proteins into their native structure in an ATP-dependent manner following the relief of stress (Rochester et al., 1986; Ellis and Hemmingsen, 1989; Hendrick and Hartl, 1993; Schr&ouml;der et al., 1993). The two most extensively studied classes of chaperones are heat shock protein (HSP) 70 homologs and cpn60 homologs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> HSP70 homologs have been found in higher plant cytoplasm (Giorini and Galili, 1991), endoplasmic reticulum (Denecke et al., 1991), chloroplasts (Marshall et al., 1990; Ko et al., 1992; Marshall and Keegstra, 1992; Madue&ntilde;o et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1993), and mitochondria (Watts et al., 1992; Neuman et al., 1993). Genes for mitochondrial HSP70 are nuclearly encoded and have been isolated from pea (Watts et al., 1992), potato and tomato (Neuman et al., 1993). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The cpn60s are a group of ubiquitous proteins with a subunit size of approximately 60 kDa that share a functional and structural similarity to the tetradecameric <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>GroEL complex (Gatenby, 1992). The maize and <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic></highlight>mitochondrial cpn60 genes have been isolated and found to be encoded in the nucleus (Prasad and Stewart, 1992). The maize cpn60 was hypothesized to aid in the assembly of new mitochondrial protein complexes during the rapid organelle biogenesis of seedling germination and heterotrophic growth (Prasad and Stewart, 1992). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Neither the HSP70 homologs nor the cpn 60 homologs are very effective indicators of a heat resistant plant&apos;s ability to tolerate heat stress. However, there is another group of heat shock proteins that may be effective indicators. This group is the low molecular mass (17-30 kDa) HSPs (Waters et al., 1996). Recent reports have established that the cytosolic forms of plant small HSPs (sHSPs) can function as molecular chaperones in vitro (Lee et al., 1995a). Lenne and Douce (1994) identified a mitochondrial matrix-localized low molecular mass HSP identified as HSP22. Pea leaf mitochondrial HSP22 is conditionally expressed only at high temperatures and the protein level remained high for at least three days following heat stress (Lenne and Douce, 1994). A cDNA for pea mitochondrial HSP22 has been identified and establishes this protein as a member of the sHSP superfamily (Lenne et al., 1995). cDNAs for mitochondrial sHSPs have also been characterized in soybean (La Fayette et al., 1996), <highlight><italic>A. thaliana </italic></highlight>(Willett et al., 1996), and <highlight><italic>Chenopodium rubrum </italic></highlight>(Lenne et al., 1995; Waters et al., 1996). However, there has not been an sHSP isolated from a mitochondria of a heat resistant plant. For example, maize is a heat-resistant plant and is one of the world&apos;s greatest food sources. The isolation of an sHSP from maize would allow for testing of plants to determine their ability to tolerate heat stress resistance. This testing could take several forms if a sHSP were isolated. Additionally, vectors could be constructed containing the nucleic acid molecule for the sHSP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There is a need for the discovery of an isolated sHSP protein from a heat resistant plant. This sHSP could be utilized to indicate a heat resistant plant&apos;s ability to tolerate heat stress. Additionally, if a sHSP were isolated from a heat resistant plant and cloned into an expression vector, there would be large quantities of HSP for research, the production of antibodies, and the generation of nucleic acid probes. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Heat stress response of maize mitochondria in planta was evaluated. It was found that levels of HSP70 and HSP60 do not change to any significant extent during heat stress treatments. In contrast, levels of mitochondrial HSP22 increase dramatically during stress and decrease after the stress is relieved. HSP22 has been identified as a member of the mitochondrial sHSP superfamily, the first identification of a mitochondrion localized sHSP in a heat tolerant plant. Experiments have indicated that mitochondrial HSP22 is responsible for protecting heat tolerant plants during heat stress. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Methods are disclosed for determining a plant&apos;s ability to survive in heat stress conditions by analyzing the level of expression of HSP22 in heat-stressed plants and comparing the amount of expression to a standard or a sample population. This expression can be measured through the use of antibodies (polyclonal, monoclonal, or fragments thereof) or nucleic acid probes that are sufficiently homologous to bind the mRNA encoding HSP22. </paragraph>

Additionally, it is well-known by those of ordinary skill in the art that oligonucleotide design allows an unlimited choice for incorporating restriction endonuclease sites into a vector and a product. The flexibility in oligonucleotide selection and restriction endonuclease site selection allows several choices for the method of preparation of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It is also well-known to practitioners of the art that the nucleic acid molecules may be recombinant or synthetic or partly synthetic and partly recombinant. Recombinant implies the use of molecular biology tools. Synthetic refers to the use of chemical synthetic procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes vectors containing nucleic acid molecules encoding HSP22. For example, the vector could comprise SEQ. ID. NOs. 1, 4, 5, 7, or a nucleic acid molecule encoding SEQ. ID. NO. 6. In one embodiment, the vector includes regulatory molecules operably positioned within the vector, whereby the nucleic acid molecules encoding HSP22 are expressed. These vectors used for expressing a given protein, or a portion thereof, are commonly referred to as expression vectors. Often these expression vectors comprise at least one origin of replication, at least one promoter, at least one ribosome binding site, and at least one terminator. Vectors often contain many other elements known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These vectors can be viral, prokaryotic or eukaryotic in origin and may serve a variety of functions not limited to expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes cells transformed with various vectors. In one embodiment, this cell is an <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>cell of the appropriate genetic makeup, transformed with an expression vector of the present invention and is capable of expressing HSP22. Such cells, commonly known as host cells, can be either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. It is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that a recombinant molecule containing the nucleic acid sequence of the present invention can be used to transform a variety of hosts using any known technique for transformation. Additionally, there are other methods besides transformation for the introduction of nucleic acids into host cells. These methods include, but are not limited to, transvection and direct introduction of nucleic acid molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Vectors transformed with the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention may also be utilized to transform plant cells to form plants that have the ability to better survive in heat stress conditions. Specifically, a plant species modified to express an amount of HSP22 in excess of a naturally occurring amount of HSP22. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In addition to the nucleic acid molecules, vectors, and transformed cells, the present invention further includes a method for the production of HSP22. This method involves the insertion of a nucleic acid molecule that encodes HSP22 into an expression vector. This vector is transformed into an appropriate host bacterial cell so that the nucleic acid molecules encoding HSP22 may be expressed. The HSP22 is then isolated from the bacteria through protein purification techniques. Through this process, HSP22 can be produced in large quantities for use in industry and research. Additionally, it is known to those skilled in the art that there are several methods besides transformation with expression vectors that allow the expression of protein from a given nucleic acid molecule. One example is transvection of certain host cells with mRNA. In another example, expression may be achieved from a nucleic acid molecule in vitro rather than in vivo. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The following discussion will assist in defining the structure for a portion of the claimed invention. The genetic code is degenerate. This means that several combinations of three nucleotides will code for the same amino acid. For example, Leu can be coded for by 6 combinations of 3 nucleotides. Many nucleic acid molecules can code for a particular amino acid molecule. Thus, there is a multitude of nucleic acid molecules that could code for the sequences of the present invention. It is intended that those nucleic acid molecules that both hybridize under stringent conditions with the nucleic acid molecule of the present invention and that code for a peptide having substantially the same physical characteristics as HSP22 are included within the scope of this invention. Stringent conditions are defined as hybridization in a medium containing 6&times; SSC or 6&times; SSPE and 40% formamide at a temperature of 37&deg; C. and a wash at 37&deg; C. with 2&times; SSC or 2&times; SSPE containing 0.1% SDS. These solutions can be prepared from 20&times; SSC or SSPE which comprise the following compositions. The 20&times; SSC is formed by mixing 175.3 g of sodium chloride and 88.2 g of sodium citrate in 1 L of water with a final pH of 7.0. The 20&times; SSPE is formed by mixing 210 g of sodium chloride, 27.6 g NaH<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, and 40 &mgr;l of 0.5 MEDTA in 1 L of water. Any nucleic acid molecules that hybridize to SEQ. ID. NO. 7 in a solution containing 6&times; SSC or 6&times; SSPE and 40% formamide at 37&deg; C. and remains bound to SEQ. ID. NO. 7 when the milieu is changed to 2&times; SSC or 2&times; SSPE containing 0.1% SDS are those nucleic acid molecules defined as hybridizing under stringent conditions. Additionally, it is well known in the art that several factors affect hybridization including the length and nature of the probe, nature of the target, concentrations of salts, components in the hybridization solution, and temperature. Therefore, this description of stringency includes equivalent hybridization and wash conditions. The results of the hybridization can be easily determined by one skilled in the art throughh Southern blot analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In describing the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention, both structure and function or physical characteristics are utilized. The structure is provided by the above description of stringency; those nucleic acid molecules that hybridize under stringent conditions. The function or physical characteristics are provided by the following discussion of the physical characteristics of HSP22. Therefore, those nucleic acid molecules that hybridize to SEQ. ID. NO. 7 and whose protein products have physical characteristics substantially similar to HSP22 are included within the scope of the present invention. Additionally, those nucleic acid molecules that hybridize to SEQ. ID. NO. 7 and whose protein products have physical characteristics substantially similar to HSP22 may code for peptide fragments which are also included within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Identification of Mitochondrial HSP22 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the expression of mitochondrial proteins of maize during conditions of heat stress. Mitochondria were isolated from three-day-old etiolated shoots grown at 29&deg; C. Three hundered &mgr;g of the mitochondrial protein was analyzed on two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>. These methods are disclosed in Example I. The designated protein spots in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> correspond to plant mitochondrial HSP70 and chaperonin 60 (cpn60). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is of mitochondria isolated from similar seedlings, except these seedlings were treated with a four-hour heat shock at 42&deg; C. Analysis of these Coomassie-stained gels indicates that very few protein spots increased in intensity during heat stress, including the HSP70 and cpn60 proteins. However, visual inspection of the gel in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> demonstrates that two protein spots were significantly increased when compared to a non-heat-shocked gel. The two protein spots that demonstrate the increase have apparent molecular weights of approximately 22 kDa. This demonstrates that one response to heat stress in a heat tolerant mitochondria is an increase in the level of this 22 kDa protein. These protein spots have been designated as HSP22. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Production of Antibodies to Mitochondrial HSP22 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The antibody production was accomplished by injecting mice independently with one of the two HSP22 protein spots from the two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels from the heat-shocked maize mitochondria. The upper panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a two-dimensional western blot of heat shock mitochondrial proteins probed with the polyclonal sera. On several occasions, the polyclonal antibodies were not specific to HSP22 and also bound to cpn60. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Polyclonal antibodies specific to the HSP22 spots were affinity purified using HSP22 protein blots. The specificity of these affinity purified antibodies is demonstrated in the western blot of heat shock mitochondria at the middle panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. These mice were eventually sacrificed for the production of monoclonal antibodies. After three fusions, a monoclonal antibody was obtained that was specific for HSP22. The specificity of this monoclonal antibody is shown in the western blot of heat shock mitochondria at the lower panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies for maize HSP22 were found to bind to minor proteins of about 30 kDa. These are most likely precursor forms of HSP22. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In addition to the monoclonal antibodies, fragments were generated using immobilized papain and immobilized pepsin as described by Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, Ill., which is hereby incorporated by reference. Methods for the production of the antibodies and fragments thereof are disclosed in Example II. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Characterization Of Mitochondrial HSP22 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Experiments were performed to determine if the monoclonal antibodies to HSP22 would recognize homologs in the chloroplast and cytoplasmic subcellular fractions. Chloroplasts, cytoplasm, and mitochondria were isolated and the distinctness of the fractions was evaluated using immunoblots and antibodies to marker enzymes (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The cytoplasm and mitochondrial fractions were from three-day-old etiolated shoots, while the chloroplast fraction was from ten-day-old light grown seedlings. NADP-malate dehydrogenase was used as a marker for the chloroplast stroma (Edwards and Huber, 1981), enolase as a maize cytoplasmic marker (Lal et al., 1994), and the alternative oxidase as a mitochondrial marker (Elthon et al., 1989). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> demonstrates that the subcellular fractions were indeed distinct. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Control and 42&deg; C. heat-shocked seedlings were fractionated into chloroplast, cytoplasm and mitochondrial fractions and then probed with the HSP22 monoclonal antibody. The upper panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a Coomassie-stained gel of the cellular fractions. The lower panel is an immunoblot probed with the HSP22 monoclonal. These results indicate that the monoclonal is specific to the mitochondrial fraction. Methods for the determination of homolog recognition of proteins in subcellular fractions by HSP22 monoclonal antibodies is disclosed generally in Examples I and II. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Submitochondrial distribution of HSP70, cpn60, and HSP22 was determined through the following: Mitochondria from control and heat-shocked seedlings were subfractionated into membrane, soluble, and complex fractions. Immunoblots of the fractions from control and heat shock mitochondria were run and probed with the monoclonals to HSP70, cpn60, and HSP22. The results indicated that the heat shock treatment had no effect on the distribution of HSP70 and cpn60. HSP70 was found primarily in the soluble fraction, cpn60 was most prevalent in the complex fraction, and HSP22 was found primarily in the soluble fraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Experiments were done to determine the temperature necessary for HSP22 to appear in maize mitochondria. To accomplish this, etiolated shoots were subjected to three different heat shock treatments. After the four-hour heat shock at the respective temperatures, the mitochondria were isolated. The upper panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> depicts a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel loaded with 20 &mgr;g of mitochondrial protein per lane. The four-hour heat-shock treatments were done at 29&deg; C. (control), 33&deg; C., 37&deg; C., and 42&deg; C. The remaining panels in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrate western blots of gels similar to Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels probed with cpn60 monoclonal (mid left), HSP70B monoclonal (mid right), &bgr;-ATPase D monoclonal (lower left), and HSP22 monoclonal (lower right). These gels demonstrate that cpn60, HSP70, and the &bgr;-ATPase subunit proteins are not significantly affected by the heat shock treatments, whereas the HSP22 protein expression begins somewhere above 33&deg; C. It appears from the gel that the quantity of HSP22 present at 37&deg; C. is significantly less than at 42&deg; C. These experiments indicate that at some point between 33&deg; C. and 37&deg; C. expression of HSP22 begins, and further, that the expression increases between 37&deg; C. and 42&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Experiments were performed to determine the decay time for HSP22. Three-day-old etiolated maize shoots were placed at 42&deg; C. and samples were removed at various time intervals. The mitochondria of these interval samples were then isolated. After the heat-shock treatment, two samples were returned to the 29&deg; C. incubator and allowed to recover for 24 and 50 hours. The upper panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel loaded with 20%g of mitochondrial protein per lane. The two middle panels of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrate western blots of similar SDS-PAGE gels probed with the monoclonal antibodies HSP70B and cpn60B. The bottom panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a western blot probed with the HSP22 monoclonal antibody. These experiments demonstrate that HSP22 protein begins to appear about one hour after the onset of the heat shock and continues to increase steadily to four hours. These experiments further demonstrate that neither HSP70 nor cpn60 change their expression when exposed to heat shock. In addition to the increased expression of HSP22, essentially all of the HSP22 is degraded after relief of the heat stress for 24 hours. Both the increased expression after exposure to heat shock and the degradation after relief of heat shock indicate that HSP22 expression and degradation are related to the timing of heat shock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> These initial experiments were further refined to better characterize the induction and decay of mitochondrial HSP22. This was accomplished by taking samples at various times after the relief of heat stress. The results are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and indicate that HSP22 levels drop gradually, but are essentially absent at 21 hours. The areas on the induction and recovery blots were quantitated and a half life for HSP22 was calculated. The half life was found to be about four hours (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). Additionally, levels of HSP22 expression were further evaluated under a continuous heat shock for various time intervals, as indicated in the upper panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. This upper panel is a Coomassie-stained gel of mitochondria isolated at various time intervals. The lower three panels are immunoblots probed individually with the monoclonals HSP70B, cpn60B, and HSP22. This illustrates that two hours of heat shock yields significant induction of HSP22 expression, with maximum expression occurring between four and six hours. After maximal induction, the levels remained high until the experiment was terminated after 44 hours of heat shock. The levels of HSP22 were quantitated at the different time intervals and the resulting graph is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The 30 kDa band, which is believed to be a precursor form of HSP22, was included in the calculation. Methods utilized for the determination of expression and degradation of HSP22 are disclosed generally in Examples I and II. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> These characterization studies demonstrate that the monoclonal antibody is useful in tracking HSP22 expression during the induction and relief of heat stress. Thus, the monoclonal antibody to HSP22 can be used to evaluate the ability to tolerate heat stress in plants by determining the amount of HSP22 expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Experiments were done to determine if the monoclonal antibody was useful in evaluating HSP22 levels in protein extracts from whole maize leaves. This was tested using maize seedlings grown at 21&deg; C. and then heat shocked for four hours at either 31&deg; C. or 38&deg; C. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> illustrates the results from the whole leaf experiments. The upper panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a Coomassie-stained gel of both mitochondrial and whole leaf fractions. The left two lanes are mitochondria isolated from control and heat shocked (42&deg; C. for four hours) etiolated maize shoots and the right three lanes are of proteins extracted from leaves of ten-day-old light grown maize seedlings grown at 21&deg; C. The first whole leaf lane is a control, the second whole leaf lane was heat shocked for four hours at 31&deg; C., and the third whole leaf lane was heat shocked for four hours at 38&deg; C. The lower panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is an immunoblot of a gel similar to the upper gel probed with the HSP22 antibody. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The results clearly demonstrate that mitochondrial HSP22 was detectable in whole leaf extracts of 38&deg; C. heat-stressed seedlings by the monoclonal antibody to HSP22. This demonstrates that the monoclonal antibody to HSP22 is useful in evaluating the ability to tolerate heat stress by testing whole leaf extracts. Further, it was found that fab and f(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>antibody fragments show greater specificity and have better access characteristics in certain types of assays such as immuno detection in whole tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Additionally, this test can be used to determine a plant&apos;s ability to tolerate heat stress by the level of expression of HSP22. The level of expression can be compared to a large sample population or to a known sample to determine if the particular plant has the ability to tolerate heat stress. Those plants with the highest level of HSP22 expression will best tolerate heat stress due to the chaperone qualities of HSP22. Methods for the detection of HSP22 expression in whole leaf samples are disclosed at Example III. The above discussion accompanied by Section III would enable those skilled in the art to identify and isolate those plants that express HSP22 in heat stress conditions so that plants can be selected that better tolerate heat stress due to the chaperone characteristics of HSP22. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The antibodies and fragments thereof are useful for diagnostic assays to detect amounts of HSP22 present in whole leaf samples. A person skilled in the art will readily recognize that combinations can be put together that would allow an individual to test a particular plant&apos;s ability to tolerate heat stress. These combinations include an aliquot of an antibody or fragment thereof that specifically binds to a portion of HSP22. The combination further comprises an immunologic detection reagent such that identification of HSP22 levels can be determined. Additionally, nucleic acid probes could be utilized to determine levels of HSP22 mRNA and one skilled in the art will readily recognize that combinations can be formed to utilize nucleic acid probes for testing heat stress resistance. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Purification and Analysis of Mitochondrial HSP22 from Maize </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Purification of HSP22 was done using anion exchange chromatography. The upper panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> depicts the UV trace and the salt gradient from the elution profile of HSP22. SDS-PAGE gels of the HSP22 containing fractions collected were either stained with Coomassie blue, as seen in the middle panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, or transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with affinity purified HSP22 polyclonal antibody, as seen in the lower panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. The elution profile appears to vary occasionally, resulting in the presence of other proteins in the HSP22 peak fractions. Cpn60 is one of the proteins that occasionally appears in these fractions. Subsequent chromatography of the pooled HSP22 peak on a hydrophobic interaction column (Phenyl Superose) removes nearly all other proteins except cpn60. The anion exchange methods are disclosed in Example V. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> An analysis was then done on the purified HSP22 by reverse phase liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference> depicts the elution profile measured at 215 nm. The most prevalent peaks were collected and labeled as 8, 9, and 10. The remaining sample was subjected to real-time analysis on a VG Platform mass spectrometer utilizing an electrospray ionization source and a quadrapole analyzer with an 8-second scan time from 700-1800 m/z. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</cross-reference> represents the total ion count that was detected by the instrument. The observed downshift of peaks and band broadening were due to the eluates travel time to the detector. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</cross-reference> illustrates a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel of 20 &mgr;l aliquot from the sample applied to the column and the three fractions (8, 9, and 10) that were recovered. To ensure that these proteins were HSP22, a similar gel was immunoblotted with the affinity purified HSP22 polyclonal at <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</cross-reference> middle panel. This blot demonstrates that both peak 8 and peak 9 contain HSP22. After recording the blot, the same gel was reprobed with the cpn60B monoclonal antibody. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</cross-reference> in the lower right panel which reveals that cpn60 was present in the sample prior to chromatography and that it was not present in peaks 8, 9, and 10. Analysis of the mass spectrum data showed that scans 303-321 contained proteins with masses of 57,650 and 57,870 and are likely to be the cpn60 component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The mass spectral data from peaks 8 and 9 were analyzed using the MassLynx software package. Scans 228-233, representing analysis of the peak 8 protein, were combined and this mass spectrum is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</cross-reference>. The raw spectrum was transformed to reveal the masses of the proteins in peak 8, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</cross-reference>. Peak 8 was found to be primarily composed of a protein with mass 19,428 Da and less abundant components with masses of 19,370 and 19,508 Da. The raw data for peak 9 is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>C and is the combined scans <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. The transformed data shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17D</cross-reference> reveals that there are two major components present, with the major being at 19,371 and the minor at 19,451 Da. The 19,370 Da component of peak 8 appears to be the major component in peak 9 and is probably due to incomplete separation of the two peaks. The difference between the remaining two components in both peak 8 and peak 9 is 80 Da, which may indicate a phosphorylation. Comparison of the two primary components of peak 8 and peak 9 reveals a mass difference of 56.7 Da. This mass difference is most likely due to differential intron splicing of the cDNA. A schematic of the four potential forms of HSP22 is shown at <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. Methods for the online reverse phase HPLC-MS are disclosed at Example VI. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Peptide Sequencing of Purified HSP22 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The relevant peaks from the C8 microbore reverse-phase HPLC column were sequenced using trypsin. The tryptic digestions of the peaks were found to have several peptide fragments of common mass and are thus believed to be very similar. Tryptic peptides that were the same between the peaks were subjected to FAB-MS/MS sequencing. To date, four tryptic peptides with masses of 727.4, 815.4, 1088.5, and 1285.7 have been sequenced. Previously, N-terminal amino acid was sequenced from the HSP22 spots by Edman degradation off of protein blots. BioLynx software was used to obtain the molecular mass of tryptic peptides present in the N-terminal amino acid sequence. Only one tryptic fragment was present and it was the N-terminus with a mass of 727.4. One reason why the tryptic peptide of mass 727.4 was sequenced by FAB-MS/MS was to confirm the N-terminal sequence and to link the two experiments. Methods for peptide sequencing are disclosed at Example VII. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Isolation and Characterization of HSP22 cDNA </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> A cDNA expression library was prepared from heat-shocked etiolated maize seedlings using the UniZAP XR phage lamda expression vector kit from Stratagene. The library was constructed using mRNA from heat-stressed etiolated maize seedlings. This expression library was initially screened with the HSP22 monoclonal antibody and one positive (P8) was obtained. After in vitro excision of the selected phage, the plasmid (ZmHSP22P8) was sequenced from both directions. Cloning and sequencing methods are disclosed at Example VIII. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, the sequence for the ZmHSP22P8 clone was found to contain the entire mature HSP22 protein coding sequence, bases <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>735</bold></highlight>, and the 3&prime; untranslated region, bases <highlight><bold>736</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1028</bold></highlight>, and a 15 bp polyadenylated tail, which is not shown. The N-terminal sequence identified for spots HSP22A and B matched this sequence exactly and identified HSP22 spot B residue 18 as Ser. Six more clones have now been sequenced and have a sequence similar to the P8. One of these clones had an additional 15 amino acids of transit peptide and these have been added to the P8 sequence. In an effort to obtain the fall sequence for the transit peptide, the P8 clone was used as a probe to screen the library again. Twenty-four additional clones of various lengths were obtained after screening 3.2&times;100 plaques. All clones were sequenced and all but one contained sequence identical to the P8 clone, but none contained the full transit peptide. The one odd clone showed signs of differential intron splicing resulting in the &plus;56.7 D shift in molecular weight as observed by mass spectrometry. Comparison of the incomplete HSP22 cDNA molecule to the Maize Expressed Sequence Tag Database developed by Pioneer Hi-Bred International allowed identification of three clones that contained identical sequence to the N-terminal region of the mature HSP22 protein. Two of these clones extended the molecule to include a putative N-terminal transit peptide and 78 nt of the 5&prime; untranslated region, which is shown by the underlined nucleotides in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. The predicted protein molecule for the entire coding portion of the putative HSP22 precursor cDNA and the cDNA nucleotide molecule are also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. The predicted mass of the entire 218 amino acid molecule is 23,816 D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In addition to utilizing the monoclonal antibody, the P8 cDNA clone was utilized as a probe to investigate levels of HSP22 mRNA in experiments similar to those described earlier where HSP22 protein levels were evaluated with immunoblots. Example IX discloses the method for using probes to determine HSP22 expression levels. Etiolated seedlings were subjected to heat stress at 42&deg; C. for four hours and then returned to the normal growth temperature for recovery. mRNA was isolated at 5, 10, and 30 minutes after the start of the recovery period and then at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 hours of recovery. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference> illustrates the northern blot analyses of these experiments. HSP22 mRNA levels remained high for 5-, 10-, and 30-minute time points, but had dropped significantly after one hour of recovery. A probe was used against the 18s rRNA as a control for RNA loading. The lower panel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> demonstrates that levels of 118s rRNA were similar in all of the lanes. These experiments demonstrate that, during the relief of stress, the half life of HSP22 mRNA is less than one hour. Those of ordinary skill in the art would know that any nucleic acid molecule that hybridizes to HSP22 mRNA will allow similar results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Northern blots were prepared from an experiment following a continuous heat shock treatment at 42&deg; C. Etiolated seedlings were exposed to 42&deg; C. and mRNA extracted at 0, 5, 10, and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 19, 24, 36, and 48 hours after the onset of heat stress. The results of this experiment are given in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. Significant levels of HSP22 mRNA were observed after 30 minutes and levels peaked at four to six hours of stress. Thereafter, the levels of HSP22 mRNA decreased becoming low at 19 to 24 hours after the imposition of stress. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art would appreciate that this probe, along with the methods in example X, can be utilized in experiments designed to identify and isolate particular plants that express HSP22 in heat stress conditions so that plants can be identified that are more heat tolerant due to the chaperone characteristics of HSP22. Additionally, those skilled in the art will readily recognize that combinations can be put together that would allow an individual to test a particular plant&apos;s ability to tolerate heat stress. These combinations would include an aliquot of a nucleic acid molecule that hybridizes to a portion of HSP22 mRNA. The combination would further comprise a detection method used to identify the bound nucleic acid. Those skilled in the art will recognize that there are many different detection methods that may be utilized such as the one illustrated in example IX. Additionally, one skilled in the art would be able to make nucleic acid probes from the disclosed sequence that would work as well as the preferred embodiment disclosed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Evaluation of the copy number for mitochondrial HSP22 was conducted with southern blots. The P8 probe was used on the southern blots to evaluate the copy number of the genomic copy of the gene. Seven different restriction enzymes were used and only one band was observed on the southern blot, indicating that the probe most likely recognizes only one gene, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Maize (<highlight><italic>Zea mays </italic></highlight>L. inbred B73) seeds were imbibed for three days, planted 1 cm deep on a 3 cm bed of coarse vermiculite in 25&times;40&times;15 cm trays, covered with a well-ventilated lid, and grown at 29&deg; C. for three days in the dark. For heat-shock experiments, entire trays were placed in a high temperature incubator for the desired duration. Mitochondria were isolated from etiolated shoots of maize as previously described (Hayes et al., Plant Physiology 97:1381-1387, 1991; Luethy et al., Plant Physiology 97:1317-1322, 1991). The protein content of various fractions was measured using the Lowry procedure as modified by Larson et al., Analytical Biochemistry 155:243-248, 1986. Isolated mitochondria were suspended in a medium consisting of 250 mM sucrose and 30 mM Mops (pH 7.2). Mitochondria were sub-fractionated into membranes, soluble proteins, and soluble proteins that are part of large complexes as described by Hayes et al., Plant Physiology, 1991, 97:1381-1387. The cytoplasmic fraction of etiolated maize shoots was obtained during isolation of mitochondria as the supernatant from the second centrifugation step (20,000&times;g for 5 min) that initially pellets the mitochondria. This supernatant was concentrated two-fold above a Centricon-10 membrane (Amicon) before use. Maize chloroplasts were isolated using a combination of procedures from Leegood and Walker, Plant Physiology 63:1212-1214, 1979 and Mourioux and Douce, Plant Physiology 67:470-473, 1981. Maize seeds were imbibed, planted in vermiculite and watered as needed for two weeks in a growth room with a 12 h photoperiod under fluorescent lighting (PPFD&equals;130-160 &mgr;mol m<highlight><superscript>&minus;2 </superscript></highlight>s<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>).

The brei was squeezed through two layers of cheesecloth and allowed to drip through eight layers of muslin wetted with grinding medium. The homogenate was centrifuged in a SS-34 rotor at 6,000&times;g for 90 s. Crude chloroplast pellets were re-suspended in 5&mgr;l of IX Percoll gradient buffer (330 mM mannitol, 2 mM EDTA, and 50 mM Mops pH 7.8) and layered on top of two 25 &mgr;l 50% Percoll (12.5 &mgr;l 2&times; Percoll gradient buffer and 12.5&mgr;l Percoll each) gradients that had been pre-centrifuged for 2 h at 10,000&times; g in an SS-34 rotor.

Rabbit polyclonal sera produced against maize mitochondria cpn60 was a gift from Dr. T. Prasad, Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, USA. Polyclonal sera raised to an over-expressed fusion protein of maize enolase was a gift from Dr. D. T. Dennis, Queens University, Ontario, Canada. Antibodies raised to NADP-malate dehydrogenase were a gift from Dr. R. Chollet, Univ. of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebr., USA. Polyclonal antisera for the mitochondrial HSP22 proteins were produced by injecting proteins electro-eluted from the separate HSP22A and HSP22B protein spots cut out after Coomassie blue visualization of 2D SDS-PAGE gels. For each mouse injected, protein spots from eight gels were electro-eluted using the Bio-Rad 422 Electro-Eluter fitted with 12.5 kD cut-off membrane caps at 10 mA per sample for 3 h. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> For the production of the HSP70, cpn60 and 13-ATPase subunit MAbs, female BALB/C mice were immunized with whole maize mitochondrial proteins. Mice producing HSP22 polyclonal antisera were used for the HSP22 monoclonal line development. Hybridomas were produced according to Elthon et al., Plant Physiology 89:1311-1317, 1989 except that growth media contained 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 25 &mgr;g/l ampicillin, 100 &mgr;g/l streptomycin sulfate, and 0.1% (w/v) amphotericin B in a base culture medium of 1&times; Dulbecco&apos;s Modified Eagle&apos;s Medium (Sigma).

<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Leaf samples were frozen in dry ice as collected and stored at &minus;80&deg; C. until used. One gram of plant tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen in a mortar and pestle until a fine powder was achieved. For standard immunoblot assays, the powders were extracted with 1&times; SDS-PAGE sample buffer and centrifuged in a microfuge at maximum speed for 5 min. The supernatants were used to run standard SDS-PAGE gels for immunoblot analysis. For ELISAs, the fine powder was extracted with 30 mM MOPS (pH 8.0). In some instances, the fine leaf powders were resuspended in the normal grinding medium and subjected to the first two centrifugation steps of mitochondrial isolation. The crude mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in ddH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O and subjected to standard SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> For detection of mitochondrial HSP22 using an ELISA, 20 &mgr;l of extracted samples were placed in separate wells of 96 well ELISA plates. The solutions PBS, PBS-Tween, and pH 9.5 buffer are as described by Elthon and McIntosh, PNAS 84:8399-8403, 1987. PBS (200 &mgr;l was added to each well and the plate incubated overnight at 4&deg; C. The solution was then shaken out of the plate and the plate rinsed with PBS-Tween twice. The HSP22 monoclonal antibody or antibody fragments were added to each well as a {fraction (1/10)} dilution in PBS-Tween (200 &mgr;l per well). The plate was incubated for 4 hours at 4&deg; C. The solution was then shaken out of the plate and the plate rinsed with PBS-Tween twice. Secondary antibody (anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase) was added to each well at a {fraction (1/1000)} dilution in PBS-Tween (200 &mgr;l per well). The plate was incubated at 4&deg; C. for 2 hours. The plate was shaken out and rinsed three times with PBS-Tween. The plate was then rinsed with pH 9.5 buffer. pNPP (para-nitrophenyl phosphate) substrate was prepared as a 0.8 &mgr;g/&mgr;l solution in pH 9.5 buffer and 200 &mgr;l added to each well and color developed before reading at 405 nm. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> HSP22 monoclonal antibody was purified using a FPLC protein G Superose column. The column was equilibrated with 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and the antibody solution applied. The column was washed with phosphate buffer until all unbound proteins were eluted. The monoclonal antibodies were then eluted with 100 mM glycine at pH 2.7. The eluted monoclonal antibodies were collected and neutralized to pH 7.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> An antibody affinity column was prepared using 4 mg of protein G Superose-purified HSP22 monoclonal antibody in a minimal volume of PBS. The antibody was bound to 1 &mgr;l of protein A Sepharose 4B beads and crosslinked for 1 hr using 20 mM diethylpimelimidate in 200 mM triethanolamine, pH 8.2. The anti-HSP22 beads were washed with PBS and pre-eluted with 50 mM CAPS buffer, pH 11.5, prior to addition of sample. Mitochondria (HS mito) from 4 hr heat-stressed seedlings were isolated, sonicated in 2 &mgr;l PBS, and centrifuged to remove the membrane (HS membrane) fraction (Hayes et al., Plant Physiology 97:1381-1387, 1991. The cytoplasmic fraction (HS cytoplasm) was isolated according to Lund et al., Plant Physiology 116:1097-1110, 1997. Approximately 5 mg of mitochondrial matrix proteins (HS matrix) was applied to the anti-HSP22 column and the proteins which did not bind were collected (HS matrix flow thru). The anti-HSP22 column was washed with 50 mM CAPS buffer pH 11.5 to elute essentially pure HSP22. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Isolated mitochondria were suspended in a medium consisting of 250 mM sucrose and 30 mM Mops (pH 7.2). Mitochondrial membranes were removed by sonication of 6 &mgr;g of washed mitochondria in 1 &mgr;l of 30 mM Mops pH 8.0 followed by ultracentrifugation in a TLA-100.2 rotor (Beckman) for 30 min at 100,000&times; g.

Approximately 5 &mgr;g of mitochondrial proteins (after removal of the membrane fraction) from heat stressed maize seedlings was applied to a Pharmacia FPLC HR5/5 Mono-Q anion exchange column. The column was washed at a flow rate of 0.5 &mgr;l minl<highlight><superscript>&minus;1 </superscript></highlight>with 10 &mgr;l of 30 mM Mops pH 8.0 and then developed with a 25 &mgr;l linear gradient to 35% (v/v) 1 M NaCl, 30 mM Mops pH 8.0. The gradient was increased to 100% (v/v) 1 M NaCl, 30 mM Mops pH 8.0 during the following 3 &mgr;l and then maintained at 100% (v/v) 1 M NaCl, 30 mM Mops pH 8.0 for 5 &mgr;l. The eluate was analyzed using a UV flow cell with a 1 cm path-length and an illuminated volume of 8.7 &mgr;l and collected in 0.5 &mgr;l fractions. The samples were analyzed for the presence of HSP22 using SDS-PAGE immunoblots. The HSP22 containing fractions were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon device with a 10 kD cut-off membrane (YM-10 Diaflo Ultrafilter, Amicon, Beverly, Mass., USA.). Solid NaCl was added to the pooled fraction to a concentration of 4M and the sample applied to a hydrophobic interaction column (Pharnacia HR5/5 Phenyl Superose) equilibrated with 4M NaCl, 30 mM Mops pH 8.0. Nearly pure HSP22 was collected from the column eluate prior to application of a decreasing salt gradient. The HSP22 containing fractions were again pooled and concentrated using the same Amicon device. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Sequencing of HSP22 Tryptic Peptides Using CID MS/MS </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> HSP22 Peak I and Peak II samples from HPLC were lyophilized and each digested with freshly prepared trypsin (treated with n-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone) (T-8642 Sigma) at 25:1 HSP22/trypsin molar ratio in 0.1 M Tris pH 7.8 for 4 hr at 37&deg; C. N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone inhibits the chymotryptic activity (non-specific cleavage at aromatic amino acids) of trypsin, therefore trypsin cleaves the protein only at the C-terminal side of Arg and Lys residues. The tryptic peptides were separated and analyzed using the online HPLC-MS system described above but using a microbore C18 reverse phase column and developed with a gradient of 2-40% (v/v) acetonitrile/ddH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O containing 0.1% (v/v) TFA over 40 min at a flow rate of 50 &mgr;l min<highlight><superscript>&minus;1</superscript></highlight>. The Platform II mass spectrometer was calibrated with NaI using an 8 second scan time from 400-2000 m/z. Peptide mass determinations are accurate to &plusmn;0.3 D. Tryptic peptides were sequenced using CID MS/MS on a Micromass AutoSpec (Micromass, Manchester, UK) fitted with an orthogonal acceleration time of flight analyzer (oaTOF) using FAB as the source of ionization. A 2 &mgr;l aliquot of the fraction containing the tryptic peptide of interest was mixed with a small amount of 1:1 (v:v) glycerovthioglycerol and placed on the FAB probe and desorbed using a 25 keV cesium ion beam. The monoisotopic (M&plus;H)<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> ions of the peptides of interest were selected by the first MS, the double focusing magnetic sector instrument, and then guided into the collision cell where the ions are collisionally activated by interactions with xenon. The masses of the resulting fragments were determined by the second mass spectrometer, the oaTOF analyzer. Masses of fragment ions were used to determine peptide amino acid composition and sequence. This technique for sequence determination is described in depth by Papayannopoulos, Mass Spectrometry Reviews, 14:49-73, 1995. Because this technique relies solely on the masses of the amino acids, their side chains, and fragmentation products, the isomeric amino acids Leu and Ile cannot be readily distinguished. </paragraph>

All northern blot procedures were performed essentially according to Selden, In Ausubel et al., eds., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley, 4.9.1-4.9.5, 1987. Following the heat stress treatment, seedling mesocotyl regions were excised and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &minus;80&deg; C. until needed. Total cellular RNA was extracted as described above and approximately 8 &mgr;g of RNA per lane was separated on 1.2% (w/v) agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to Magnagraph nylon membranes (NSI, Westboro, Mass., USA) and fixed by UV cross-linking.
