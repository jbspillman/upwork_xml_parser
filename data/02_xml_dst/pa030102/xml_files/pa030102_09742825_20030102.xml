<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a technique for forming a ferroelectric film on a substrate. More specifically, the present invention relates to a solution and a method for forming a uniform ferroelectric film free from uneven coating (striation) on a substrate. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Films of lead zirconate titanate (PZT), lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT), strontium bismuth tantalate (SBT) and other composite oxides can be used for DRAMs, FRAMs and other semiconductor memory devices, as well as for capacitors, sensors, actuators, etc. because of their high dielectricity, ferroelectricity, piezoelectric effect and pyroelectricity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Solutions prepared from an organic solvent and metal alkoxides having an element constituting the ferroelectric film or other organic metal compounds are used for forming ferroelectric films. Alcohol, ethylene glycol derivatives, xylene etc. can be used as an organic solvent for these solutions; but ethylene glycol derivatives, especially ethylene glycol monomethyl ether are most widely used (JP, 5-319958, A, JP, 7-90594, A). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, in recent years, the harmfulness of ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and other ethylene glycol derivatives has been being considered to be a problem. Consequently, safety of ethylene glycol derivatives has been actively debated and legislation restricting their use has been introduced in some countries, since their adverse effect on the reproductive function has been discovered. In response to this international trend, in Japan too, there has been a movement, especially in the electronics industry, to restrict the use of ethylene glycol derivatives; hence developing solutions for forming ferroelectric films not employing ethylene glycol derivatives has been desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A solution and a method for forming ferroelectric films not using ethylene glycol derivatives are known from JP, 9-278415, A, and JP, 10-226519, A, wherein a low toxic organic solvent having little influence on the reproductive function such as primary alcohol, propylene glycol monomethyl ether or propylene glycol monoethyl ether is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, when using these organic solvents for forming a film on a substrate, especially when the film is formed by the so-called spin coating method in which the substrate placed on a spinner is rotated at a high speed after a solution has been dripped onto it, striation tends to occur, so that it is difficult to form a uniform ferroelectric film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is clear that with a capacitor electrode area of several &mgr;m or less, as used in actual electronic devices, striation, which is a stripe-shaped film thickness distribution, causes inhomogeneity of capacitor properties. Consequently, to eliminate such unevenness of device properties&apos; the problem of striation needs to be resolved. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be explained in greater detail by means of Examples and Comparative Examples, without however limiting the present invention to these Examples. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Suspension (A) was prepared by adding and dissolving 0.575 mol of lead acetate trihydrate in 719 g of propylene glycol monomethyl ether, by concentrating the mixture by means of dehydration and by cooling it to the room temperature. While solution (B) was prepared by adding and dissolving 0.20 mol of zirconium tetra-n-propoxide and 0.30 mol of titanium tetraisopropoxide in 625 g of propylene glycol monomethyl ether, by concentrating the mixture by means of dehydration and by cooling it to the room temperature. Thereafter, suspension (A) was mixed and reacted with solution (B) and the mixture was concentrated and cooled to the room temperature. Following this, acetylacetone and water was added, and the mixture was subjected to a hydrolysis reaction and cooled to the room temperature, after which, a solution for forming a PZT film was prepared by passing the mixture through a 0.2 &mgr;m filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> This solution was applied onto a Pt/Ti/SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/Si substrate by spin coating, which was then dried in a clean oven at 250&deg; C. for 30 minutes, whereupon the presence of striation in the coated film was confirmed. Thereafter, the substrate was prebaked in a diffusion furnace at 600&deg; C. for 10 minutes. Following this, the solution was again applied by spin coating, dried and prebaked, after which baking was performed in an oxygen atmosphere in a diffusion furnace at 600&deg; C. for 60 minutes; however, striation was observed and a PZT film with a uniform surface was not obtained </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the surface of the obtained PZT film observed through an optical microscope. The stripes extending in the vertical direction, placed at an estimated frequency of about 60 to 70 &mgr;m, are the striation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the result of a scanning in the perpendicular direction to these stripes (the direction perpendicular to the straight line passing through the center of spin coating on the surface of the sample: the horizontal direction in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) with a surface roughness meter. It was observed that the maximum unevenness of about 20 nm was repeated at a frequency of 60 to 70 &mgr;m. The statistical mean roughness Ra was about 11 nm. These results clearly showed that the striation observed on the obtained PZT film was a stripe shaped film thickness distribution with a frequency of about 60 to 70 &mgr;m. On the surface of this PZT film, 100 &mgr;m square Ir/IrO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>upper layer electrodes were made by etching after sequential deposition of 50 nm of IrO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 100 nm of Ir by sputtering. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(A) and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(B) respectively show the P (polarization)&minus;V (voltage) hysteresis curve and the leak current density of the PZT film capacitance obtained by applying a voltage between the upper electrodes and the Pt electrodes existing at the lower part of the PZT film. With the residual polarization at 5 V of about 20 &mgr;C/cm<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>computed from the hysteresis curve and the leak current density at 5 V of about 4&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6 </superscript></highlight>A/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, the PZT film, although striation occurred, showed excellent properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The effect of striation (film thickness distribution) had been averaged and there was no impact on capacitor properties, because the 100 &mgr;m square electrodes of ferroelectric capacitors were bigger than the frequency of striation. However, since the size of capacitor electrodes for practical applications is measured in several square &mgr;m or less, the film thickness distribution caused by striation is reflected in the film thickness distribution of each capacitor on the wafer, and as a result, a dispersion of capacitor properties occured. </paragraph>
