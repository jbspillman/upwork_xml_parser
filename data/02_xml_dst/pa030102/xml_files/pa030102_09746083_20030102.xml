<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a three-dimensional array which is field programmable. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth such as specific material and layer thicknesses. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known circuits and fabrication techniques have not been set forth in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a novel antifuse memory and its method of fabrication. The present invention utilizes a surface treatment or a hard mask process to produce an antifuse structure which enhances antifuse performance by providing a more controllable and reliable programming (breakdown) voltage. The antifuse memory of the present invention comprises a first plurality of spaced apart rail-stacks having a top semiconductor material of a first conductivity type. A fill dielectric is formed between the individual rail-stacks. An antifuse material, such as silicon dioxide, is formed over the first plurality of rail-stacks. A second plurality of spaced apart rail-stacks having a lower semiconductor material of opposite polarity than the first semiconductor material, is then formed over the antifuse layer and over the first plurality of spaced apart rail-stacks and the fill dielectric. The second plurality of spaced apart rail-stacks is generally in a direction perpendicular to the first plurality of spaced apart rail-stacks. Each of the intersections of the first rail-stacks and the second rail-stacks generate an antifuse memory cell. The cells are programmable by providing a relatively high voltage (5-20 volts) between the rail-stacks of a given memory cell so as to forward bias the diode created by using semiconductor materials of different conductivity types in the first and second spaced apart rail-stacks. The relatively high voltage causes a breach or rupture in the antifuse layer which creates a diode. Without the high voltage the antifuse layer remains an insulator. Thus by selecting pairs of conductors, diodes can be selectively formed so as to program the array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention a surface treatment or hard mask process is used to insure that all memory cells of the array can be programmed at substantially the same voltage by controlling the locations at which the antifuse material ruptures and/or by controlling the thicknesses uniformity of the antifuse material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, a short semiconductor material etch is used prior to antifuse deposition or growth in order to slightly recess the semiconductor material below the top surface of dielectric fill between the spaced apart rail-stacks. In an embodiment of the present invention the semiconductor material is recessed to a fraction of the thickness of which a deposited antifuse material is to be formed so that the antifuse material can be deposited uniformly on the semiconductor region. Alternatively, the semiconductor material can be recessed to a depth greater than the thickness of the antifuse material and than the antifuse material grown on the semiconductor film. Because the recess is deeper than the thickness of the antifuse material, the antifuse material is confined between adjacent fill dielectrics thereby creating a uniform thickness antifuse film across the semiconductor material surface. By recessing the semiconductor material, the antifuse material is formed to a uniform thickness between the semiconductor materials of the first and second rail-stacks thereby enabling a more uniform and reproducible programming of the antifuse across the memory array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the fill dielectric is recessed below the top surface of the semiconductor material prior to antifuse deposition. By slightly recessing the fill dielectric, a convex corner or protrusion is generated in the semiconductor material. By creating and exposing a corner of the semiconductor material the antifuse always &ldquo;blows&rdquo; or ruptures at the corner of the semiconductor material because of the high electric fields experienced at the corner. Because each antifuse blows at the corner, each cell will have substantially the same programming voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Thus, according to the surface treatment embodiments of the present invention, a slight recess etch of the fill dielectric or of the semiconductor material is done prior to antifuse deposition or growth in order to generate antifuse cells which are programmed at the same voltage. Controlling the sigma of the breakdown voltage of an antifuse is extremely valuable in that it allows one to reduce the margin between write and read, reducing the voltage required from drivers, thus reducing their power and therefore the amount of substrate area they require. Additionally, limiting the total area at the critical thickness of the antifuse increases both yield and reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a hard mask is used during rail stack patterning and as a polish stop during chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) of the gap fill dielectric. The height of the gap fill dielectric is selected in order to affect the protrusion or recession of the array line once the hard mask is stripped. The protrusion or recession is selected in order to manipulate the antifuse rupture (i.e., cell programming) process. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Overview of the Structure of the Invented Memory Array </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The invented memory array is fabricated on several levels and, for instance, may have eight levels of storage. Each level includes a first plurality of parallel spaced-apart rail-stacks running in a first direction and a second plurality of rail-stacks or conductors (depending on the embodiment) running in a second direction. Generally, the first rail-stacks run perpendicular to the second conductors/rail-stacks and hence form a right angle at their intersections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The use of rail-stacks is a departure from prior art three-dimensional memories where conductors alone were used in lieu of rail-stacks, and where discrete cells (e.g., pillars) were formed at the intersections of the lines. As will be seen, a bit is stored at each of the intersections of rail-stacks. However, there is no apparent individual memory cell at the intersections, rather memory cells are defined by the rail-stacks and intermediate layers. This makes it easier to fabricate the invented array as will be seen. When the array is fabricated all the bits are in the zero (or one) state and after programming, the programmed bits are in the one (or zero) state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> several rail-stacks are illustrated in the partial cross-section of the invented array. For instance, rail-stack <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is shown at one height and a half rail-stack <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is shown at a second height above the first height. Also, half rail-stacks are disposed between rail-stack <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. These lower rail-stacks run in the same direction as the half rail-stack <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A bit is stored at the intersection of rail-stacks and, for instance, a &ldquo;cell&rdquo; is present between the rail-stacks and layers shown within the bracket <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and another within the bracket <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Each of these brackets span a memory level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The array is fabricated on a substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which may be an ordinary monocrystaline silicon substrate. Decoding circuitry, sensing circuits, and programming circuits are fabricated in one embodiment within the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> under the memory array using, for instance, ordinary MOS fabrication techniques. Vias are used to connect conductors within the rail-stacks to the substrate to allow access to each rail-stack in order to program data into the array and to read data from the array. For instance, the circuitry within the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may select rail-stack <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the rail stack <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in order to either program or read a bit associated with the intersection of these rail-stacks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an insulating layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed over the substrate in order that the array may be fabricated above the substrate. This layer may be planarized with, for instance, chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) to provide a flat surface upon which the array may be fabricated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Following this, a conductive layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed on the substrate. As will be seen, conductive layers are used within the rail-stacks and these layers and the resultant conductors may be fabricated from elemental metals such as tungsten, tantalum, aluminum, or copper, or metal alloys may be used, such as MoW. Metal silicides may also be used such as TiSi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or COSi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or a conductive compound such as TiN, or WC may be used. A highly doped semiconductor layer such as silicon is also suitable. Multiple layer structures may be used selecting one or more of the above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Following the deposition of a conductive layer, a layer of semiconductor material (layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) such as silicon is formed over the conductive layer. This is typically a polysilicon layer; however, an amorphous layer may be used. Other semiconductor materials may be used such as Ge, GaAs, etc. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> this semiconductor layer is highly doped and, as will be seen, forms one-half a diode. After masking and etching steps, half rail-stacks are formed. These rail-stacks are &ldquo;half&rdquo; or partial rail-stacks since they are approximately half the thickness of the rail-stacks used in the next level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Following a dielectric deposition and polish to form a dielectric fill, in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> material for the antifuses used to program the array is deposited. In one embodiment, the layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a dielectric such as silicon dioxide which is deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) in a blanket deposition over the half rail-stacks and over a dielectric fill which fills the spaces between the rail-stacks. In another embodiment the layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is grown on the upper surface of the silicon layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and only exists on the rail-stacks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Now a full set of memory array rail-stacks is formed on the layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This comprises first the deposition of a lightly doped silicon layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> doped with a conductivity type dopant opposite to that used for the silicon layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a heavily doped silicon layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> doped also opposite to the layer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a conductive layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and a heavily doped silicon layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> doped with the same conductivity type dopant as layers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. After masking and etching, the rail-stacks shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, such as rail-stack <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, are formed. These rail-stacks are, as illustrated, in a direction perpendicular to the rail-stacks above and below them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> While not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> but as will be described later, the spaces between the rail-stacks after they are defined, are filled with a dielectric such as silicon dioxide. Then the rail-stacks and fill are planarized by CMP. In another embodiment spin-on-glass (SOG) is used to fill the voids. In this case chemical planarization can be used, for example, plasma etching. Other fill and planarization methods can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> After formation of the rail-stacks another antifuse layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed, for instance, from a dielectric such as silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, amorphous carbon or other insulating materials or combinations of materials. (Also an undoped layer of silicon may be used for the antifuse layer.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Now another layer of rail-stacks are defined and only half rail-stacks are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> at this upper level. This half rail-stack comprises a silicon layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> doped with a conductivity type dopant opposite to that of layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This is a lightly doped layer. Another silicon layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed on layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and this layer is doped with the same conductivity type dopant as layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, however, it is more heavily doped. Then a conductive layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is formed above the layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Half rail-stacks are used at the very upper-most level of the array and at the very lowest level of the array. In between the half rail-stacks the full rail-stacks, such as rail-stack <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, are used throughout the array. If desired, a full rail stack can be used for the uppermost level of the array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the silicon layers disposed on the conductive layers extend the entire length of the rail-stacks in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and are uninterrupted except possibly where vias are used to provide a conductive path to the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1 a</cross-reference> path <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is illustrated from a lower conductor in level <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to an upper conductor in this level found in the rail-stack <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This path is accessed in one embodiment through decoding circuitry in the substrate for both programming and reading of data into and from the array for one bit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> For instance, to program the bit, a relatively high voltage, 5-20V is applied between the conductors generally so as to forward-bias the &ldquo;diode&rdquo; between these conductors. This relatively high voltage causes a breach in the layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> creating a diode. Without this high voltage, the layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> remains an insulator. Thus, by selecting pairs of conductors, diodes can be selectively formed so as to program the array. While programming the array with the layers adjacent to the antifuse material being forward-biased is currently preferred, it is also possible to program using a reverse-biasing potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> To sense the data programmed into the array, a voltage lower than that for programming is used. This voltage is applied so as to forward-bias the diode of the cell being accessed and thus allowing a sense amplifier to determine whether or not the layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is intact between the rail-stacks. Note that &ldquo;sneak&rdquo; or parasitic paths in the array which would interfere with the sensing will include a reverse-biased diode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Also as will be described later, the &ldquo;anode&rdquo; and &ldquo;cathode&rdquo; of the diodes are reversed at each of the successive antifuse layers. This facilitates easier programming and sensing since all of its conductors at each level are either bit lines or word lines. And, for instance, conductors at one height will serve as bit lines for two levels and conductors at the next height serve as word lines for two levels. This simplifies the decoding and sensing and more importantly reduces processing. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Embodiment of FIG. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the cross-section elevation view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, one embodiment is illustrated which corresponds to the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> the half rail-stacks of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are not illustrated. Three complete levels <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the array are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Below layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> other rail-stacks or half rail-stack are used. Also above layer <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, a full or half rail-stack is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The rail-stack <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> comprising layers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> includes a lightly doped N&minus; layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a heavily doped N&plus; layer <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, a conductor layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and N&plus; layer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The fabrication of these rail-stacks will be discussed in more detail in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> through <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. An antifuse layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which for the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a blanket deposition, covers all of the rail-stacks formed below layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> as well as the fill filling the voids between the rails. As mentioned, the layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be a deposited silicon dioxide in one embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that N&plus; layers sandwich the conductor layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. These highly doped layers provide ohmic transitions to prevent unintended Schottky diode formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The layers above and below conductor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are not symmetrical for the embodiment illustrated in that an N&minus; layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is used below the conductor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and not above the conductor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Only a single lightly doped layer (in conjunction with a heavily doped layer) is needed to define a diode; the thickness of this lightly doped layer is important in controlling the break-down voltage, reverse leakage current and resistance of the diode so formed. The layer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a heavily doped semiconductor layer, and the fill are planarized after the rail-stacks are defined and then a blanket deposition of the antifuse layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is formed on the layer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. It is important to ensure that the planarization step exposes layer <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> everywhere so that the devices work properly. (The lines <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are used to indicate that the antifuse layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and like layers are not etched with the rail-stack below it and thus extend over the entire array for the illustrated embodiment.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> One advantage to the layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the other like layers in the structure, such as layers <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, is that since they are an unbroken deposition, sidewall leakage (into the rail-stacks below) will be minimized, limiting electrical problems during reading and writing. When subsequent conductive material is deposited, it is unable to reach the sides of the rail-stacks below it because of this blanket deposition of the antifuse layer. For instance, path <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, which would allow silicon from layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to cause a parasitic path, does not exist because of the unbroken blanket deposition of the antifuse layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Rail-stacks <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> comprising layers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> are formed on the antifuse layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is lightly doped with a P-type dopant for the embodiment illustrated followed by a P&plus; layer <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, a conductive layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and a P&plus; layer <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. After these layers are deposited, they are masked and etched to define the rail-stacks. Then the voids between these rail-stacks, such as void <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, are filled with a dielectric. The fill dielectric is planarized along with a portion of P&plus; layer <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Planarization is done at this point in the fabrication since there is generally poor control over the thickness and contour of the fill. The fill tends to build up on the rail-stacks when a non-spin-on deposition is used. This is followed by a blanket deposition of layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The process is now repeated, this time beginning with an N&minus; layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> followed by an N&plus; layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, a conductive layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and N&plus; layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Again after defining the rail-stacks <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the voids are filled and the surface is planarized. Another antifuse layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is deposited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The process is repeated for the rail-stacks <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> this time beginning with a P&minus; layer <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, P&plus; layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, conductive layer <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, P&plus; layer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Again after defining the rail-stacks, filling the void <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and then planarizing, another antifuse layer <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> is deposited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> As shown by the path <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, when a large enough voltage is applied between conductors <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the antifuse layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, at the intersection of layers <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, is breached or ruptured creating a diode at the intersection. As mentioned, this is selectively done throughout the array to program the array. The conductor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is therefore a bit line for the &ldquo;cells&rdquo; above and below it. For instance, path <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> indicates another possible current path for another &ldquo;cell&rdquo; where the conductor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is again a bit line during sensing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that with the reversal of the P&minus; and N&minus; layers at each successive rail-stack, planarization always occurs on a heavily doped layer such as layer <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> and layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the lightly doped layers are always formed on relatively planar surfaces, consequently their thickness can be more easily controlled. This, as mentioned, allows the characteristics of the diode (once the intermediate antifuse layer is breached) to be more reliably controlled. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Processing Flow for the Embodiment of FIG. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The process flow for forming rail-stack <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. It will be apparent that the rail-stacks for the other embodiment can be similarly processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> First, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> an antifuse layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is deposited. This typically is 25-200&angst; of silicon dioxide which can be deposited with any one of very well-known processes. Following this, a silicon layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is deposited which is typically 1000-4000&angst; thick and formed with a CVD process where a phosphorous dopant is deposited along with the deposition of for instance, the polysilicon semiconductor material or where the dopant is ion implanted following the deposition of the layer. This layer is doped to a level between 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>15</superscript></highlight>-1&times;10<highlight><superscript>18</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In this application &ldquo;polysilicon&rdquo; layers may be deposited as polysilicon or may be formed from an amorphous silicon layer. In one embodiment, an amorphous silicon layer is deposited and annealed in a rapid thermal anneal (RTA) step of 800&deg; C. for 1 minute. This increases the crystal sizes and activates the dopant. The dopant can be ion implanted or introduced during the deposition of the amorphous silicon layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Now, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> N&plus; layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is deposited again using CVD. This layer may be approximately 300-3000&angst; thick and in one embodiment is doped to a level of &gt;10<highlight><superscript>19</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Throughout this application two adjacent silicon layers are often shown such as layers <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, with different doping. These layers may be formed in one deposition by changing the dopant concentration during an in-situ deposition process. Alternatively, these layers may be formed with one deposition, followed by an ion implantation step at two different energy levels and dosages to obtain the two doping levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> conductive layer which may be 500-1500&angst; thick is formed using any one of numerous well-known thin film deposition processes such as sputtering. A refractory metal may be used or a silicide of a refractory metal. Also as mentioned aluminum or copper can be used, or more simply the heavily doped silicon can be the conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, another semiconductor layer of, for instance, polysilicon approximately 1500-2000&angst; thick, is formed again doped to a level of &gt;<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><superscript>19</superscript></highlight>/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. This is shown as layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>; after planarization its thickness is between 300&angst; and 2000&angst; thick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> A masking and etching step is now used to define rail-stacks, such as rail-stacks <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Note that when comparing this view to the view of rail-stack <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is taken from the side and consequently shows the individual rail-stacks. An ordinary masking and etching step, for instance, photolithography followed by plasma etching, may be used. Etchants can be used that stop on the antifuse layer thus preventing this layer from being etched away. Thus, layer <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can be considered an etchant stop layer depending on the specific etchants used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Now as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the spaces between the rail-stacks are filled with a dielectric <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> such as formed with a high density plasma chemical vapor deposition (HDPCVD) process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Chemical-mechanical polishing is then employed to planarize the upper surface of the rail-stacks shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> in one embodiment. Chemical etching can also be used as mentioned with certain dielectrics. This planarization can reduce the thickness of the layer <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to approximately 300&angst;, thus this layer ends up being of approximately the same thickness as the layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. After planarization, the substrate has a planarized surface <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> whereby the top surface of the N&plus; regions of the rail stacks <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> are substantially planar with the top surfaces of dielectric fill <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Surface Treatment Embodiments </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Next, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, a surface treatment is now used to improve the surface morphology and topology so that the anitfuse <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be reproducibly formed and reproducibly programmed. A surface treatment in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention is set forth in FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>D and the accompanying description. According to the first embodiment of the present invention, the substrate is subjected to a short silicon etch so that the top surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the top N&plus; silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is slightly recessed below the top surface <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the fill dielectric <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to form a recess <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> which is bounded by sidewalls <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of fill dielectric <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</cross-reference>. In an embodiment of the present invention, the top surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the N&plus; silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is recessed approximately 5-150&angst; below the top surface <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the dielectric fill material <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment of the present invention, the recess has a depth which is a fraction of the thickness desired for antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Recess <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can be formed utilizing any well-known etchant or technique which can preferentially etch the silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> with respect to fill dielectric <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> (i.e., use a silicon etch which is selective to the fill dielectric <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>). In an embodiment of the present invention, the silicon etch is a nonpolymer forming etchant so that the silicon surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> stays atomically clean. A nonpolymer forming silicon recess etch which is selective to an oxide fill dielectric can be accomplished utilizing a NF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>plasma etch or a CF<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>plasma etch. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the silicon recess etch is accomplished utilizing a wet etch such as a wet etch comprising nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid or a wet etch comprising KOH. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>B, if desired, in an embodiment of the present invention the silicon recess etch is followed by a short sputter etch to shape the sidewall <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of the oxide fill <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> into a sloped sidewall <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</cross-reference>. A slopped sidewall <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> allows the subsequently deposited antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to be more uniform as it transitions from the fill dielectric to the silicon surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the sputter etch can be used to remove contaminants. During sputter etching, care should be taken not to roughen the surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> too much and thereby create nonuniformities across the surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. A sputter etch which removes 25-50&angst; SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, such as a sputter etch with Argon ions with between 100-1000 volts bias and a pressure between 0.1-5.0 mtorrs, is suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>C, after the silicon recess etch (and sputter etch, if used) the antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is blanket deposited over and onto surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and surface <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and sidewall <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of dielectric fill <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment of the present invention, the antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is deposited to a thickness which is sufficient to completely fill recess <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> with antifuse material. Completely filling the recess <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> with antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> helps to insure uniform film coverage over a corner <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> of the silicon film which helps to prevent electric field enhancement at the silicon corner <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. In this way, the antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> over the silicon corner <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is at least as thick as the antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> formed on horizontal silicon surfaces. In an embodiment of the present invention, the deposited antifuse material is an oxide. A deposited oxide antifuse material can be formed by a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process utilizing a deposition chemistry comprising SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Alternatively, a deposited oxide antifuse <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be a thermally deposited oxide such as a low temperature oxide (LTO) deposited by thermal disassociation of SiH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at a temperature between 350-600&deg;. Alternatively, a deposited oxide antifuse can be a high temperature oxide (HTO). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10D, a</cross-reference> plurality of rail stacks <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are formed on antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In order to form rail stacks <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> a lower P&minus; type silicon film <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is blanket deposited over and onto antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> followed by the sequential blanket deposition of a P&plus; type silicon film <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, conductor <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, and a P&plus; type silicon film <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The p type silicon films (<highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>) can be formed by the same technique and to the same thickness and concentrations, but by utilizing opposite conductivity type dopants (e.g., boron) as n type silicon films <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of rail stack <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Conductor <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> can be formed over the same material and to the same thickness and by the same technique as conductor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The films of rail stack <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> would then be patterned by well-known photolithography and etching techniques into a plurality of spaced-apart rail stacks which run in a direction perpendicular to the plurality of rail stacks (<highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>) of rail stacks <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. A fill <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> would then be formed over and between the plurality of spaced-apart rail stacks <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and planarized the form a planar surface. The planar surface would then be treated in accordance with the surface treatment of the present invention to improve the uniformity and performance of subsequently formed antifuse <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A surface treatment in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention is set forth in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>D. According to this embodiment of the present invention, first surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>A, is etched below surface <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the fill dielectric <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> so that a recess <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is formed which is bounded by sidewalls <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of fill dielectric <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment of the present invention, the recess <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is formed to a depth which is greater than the thickness desired of the antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Recess <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can be formed by techniques and with etchants as described above. Next, if desired, the silicon recess etch can be followed by a sputter etch as described above to produce sloped sidewalls <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>C, an antifuse material is grown on silicon surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of recess <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. An oxide antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be grown by exposing the substrate to an oxidizing ambient such as O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O (without a silicon source gas) while heating the substrate or creating a plasma. Such a processes will selectively grow silicon dioxide on locations where silicon is available to oxidize, such as silicon surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and will not grow on locations, such as fill dielectric <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, where silicon is unavailable for oxidation. In an embodiment of the present invention, antifuse <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is an oxide grown by exposing the substrate to a high density plasma (HDP) formed from O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>molecules. Alternatively, a suitable grown oxide antifuse <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be formed by a thermal process, such as a furnace oxidation in a wet ambient such H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, or a rapid thermal oxidation utilizing an O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>ambient. Because the silicon surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is sufficiently recessed below the surface <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the fill dielectric <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and because the antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is grown, as opposed to deposited, the grown antifuse oxide is constrained by the sidewalls <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of recess <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. In this way, an antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is formed which has a very uniform thickness across the surface <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the N&plus; silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. A uniform antifuse film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> across the surface of N&plus; silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> helps insure a uniform and reliable antifuse programming and performance. Although forming sloped sidewalls is not required, they are especially useful when growing an oxide by a high density process because corners can become charged or create shadowing which can create deflections in the ionized oxygen atoms leading to nonuniform film growth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Next, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11D, a</cross-reference> plurality of the rail stacks (rail stacks <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) are formed over and onto antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> as well as onto the surface of dielectric fill material <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>.

According to this embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>A, the substrate of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is subjected to a short dielectric etch which etches away the top of the dielectric film so that the top surface <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the fill dielectric <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is recessed below the top surface <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the upper N&plus; silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of rail stack <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to form a recess <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which is bounded by the sidewalls <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. According to this embodiment of the present invention, the dielectric fill material is recessed below silicon surface <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> so that a convex corner or protrusion <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> is formed at the top edge of the N&plus; silicon film. In an embodiment of the present invention, the top surface <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> dielectric fill material <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is recessed between 50-200&angst; below the top surface <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The fill dielectric <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can be recessed with any well-known etchant which can preferentially etch the fill dielectric without substantially etching silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> (i.e., recess is formed with a fill dielectric etch that is selective to silicon). If the fill dielectric is an oxide and if the top semiconductor material is silicon then a plasma etch comprising CHF<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>can be used. Preferably, a wet etch comprising HF and H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O can be used. </paragraph>

In an embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is a deposited oxide formed to a thickness between 20-80&angst;. A deposited oxide antifuse film can be formed as described above. Because the antifuse <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is deposited, it is also forms on surface <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of recessed fill dielectric <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, in an embodiment of the present invention as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the antifuse material is an oxide grown to a thickness between 20-80&angst;. Because the oxide is grown, it forms only on exposed silicon regions, such as surface <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, corner <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>, and sidewalls <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and does not form on surface <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of fill dielectric <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

When a deposited antifuse is used, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>C-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the rail stack is formed on the antifuse on the silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and fill dielectric <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>.

Rail stacks <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be formed as described above. It is to be appreciated that as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>C-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>C-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the corner <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> of the N&plus; silicon extends above the fill dielectric. Such a protruding corner creates a high electric field at the corner during programming. In this way, the antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> will always &ldquo;blow&rdquo; or rupture at the region <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> above corner <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. Because the antifuse material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> always &ldquo;blows&rdquo; or ruptures at corner <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>, a thicker antifuse film can be used which lowers the overall leakage of the cell while still retaining a low breakdown (programming) voltage. </paragraph>

A sputter etch process which has 25-50&angst; SiO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>equivalent removal can be used, such as the sputter etch described above. </paragraph>

In an embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>C-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the antifuse material is a deposited oxide formed to a thickness between 20-80&angst;.

Because the oxide antifuse is grown, it forms only on exposed silicon regions, such as surface <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and beveled corner <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, and does not form on surface <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of fill dielectric <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>C-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>.

<heading lvl="1">Overview of a Hard Mask Embodiment of the Present Invention </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> A thin (e.g., 1500&angst;) silicon nitride (SiN<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>) layer is deposited above a silicon layer by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and used as both a hard mask during array patterning and a polish stop during chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). Alternatively, the masking layer may be deposited in a LPCVD furnace. A thin (e.g., 200&angst;) buffer oxide layer can be formed on the silicon layer prior to the silicon nitride layer to protect the underlying silicon layer. The use of SiN<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>as an etch hard mask as well as a CMP stopping layer is a well established component of the shallow trench isolation (STI) manufacturing process. The process flow corresponding to an embodiment is as follows: (1) blanket deposition of array rail-stack materials, culminating with a SiN<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>film; (2) photolithography used to delineate array features; (3) array patterning by plasma etching using the SiN<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>layer as a hard mask (note that additional benefits of the hard mask may include better CD control over the non-hard mask case); (4) gap fill, typically with HDP-CVD silicon dioxide, where the height to which the gaps are filled can be chosen carefully as will be discussed below; (5) CMP, with the SiN<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>acting as the polish stop, using a CMP slurry that erodes silicon dioxide at a much faster rate than SiN<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>such as a silica slurry or ceria (CeO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) slurry; (6) post-CMP clean typically in an NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>OH-based scrub; (7) SiN<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>removal via plasma or wet etching; and (8) growing or CVD blanket deposition of an antifuse layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In step (4) above, the spaces of the line/space arrays are filled with silicon dioxide. The height of the fill for these spaces (gaps) is selected in order to effect the protrusion or recession of the array lines in the antifuse layer once the SiN<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>is stripped. That is, if the gap fill target height corresponds to the lower edge of the SiN<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>layer, no protrusion or recession is targeted. If a line recession is desired, the gap is filled to a point above the lower edge of the SiN<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>layer, with the absolute fill height a function of the degree of recession desired. If a line protrusion is desired, the gap is filled to a point below the lower edge of the SiN<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>layer, with the absolute fill height again a function of the degree of protrusion desired. In short, a protrusion or recession (or lack thereof) is selected in order to manipulate the antifuse rupture (i.e., cell programming) process. For example, a uniform protrusion or recession of array lines over the wafer surface may result in more repeatably programmable memory cells due to electric field concentration at the protrusion or recession corners. Likewise, it may be that devices constructed this way are more reliable. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">A Specific Hard Mask Embodiment of the Present Invention </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Like the surface treatment embodiments of FIGS. <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the hard mask embodiment will be described with respect to the formation of the antifuse devices formed between the intersections of the fifth and sixth rail stacks of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Accordingly, processing occurs as set forth in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. After the formation of the N&plus; silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> hard mask layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is formed on the silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</cross-reference>. The layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> may be formed from material such as silicon nitride to a thickness of 1500&angst;. Other materials that may be used as the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> include but are not limited to TiN, tungsten, and tungsten silicide (WSi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). The layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> should be of a hard material, that is, a material that erodes more slowly than the dielectric filling material used in a subsequent step. As will be seen the layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, after patterning, acts as a polish stop for a planarization step. Typically, the hard masking layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> will include a lower thin (25-200&angst;) buffer oxide layer to protect the silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> After the layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> as been formed, it is patterned using ordinary photolithographic steps to form a mask. In one embodiment the layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> defines parallel spaced-apart lines. This is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference> where the layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, after patterning includes the masking features <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Additionally, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference> the films of rail stacks are etched in alignment with the mask forming the lines <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Spaces <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> result between the lines as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Following the etching shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>B, the spaces <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> between the lines <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> are filled with a dielectric material <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, such as a CVD formed silicon dioxide or other dielectric material. This material is chosen to be softer than the masking layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, as mentioned. An important example is the use of a CMP slurry that is selective to silicon dioxide over the silicon nitride. That is, the erosion rate of silicon dioxide is much greater than that of silicon nitride using such slurry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> With the present invention in one embodiment, the fill <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</cross-reference> is filled to a level below the upper surface of the rails <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. This is shown by dimension <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment of the present invention, the fill is between 50-500&angst; below the upper surface of rails <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Fill <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> accumulates on the tops of the masking members as a result of filling the dielectric material between the lines. Well-known processing steps are used to assure the desired height of the fill between the lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Next in the process, planarization occurs which removes the dielectric material from the upper surfaces of the masking members. While chemical planarization may be used, in one embodiment chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) is preferred. The etchants used in such planarization are selected from commercially available etchants such that the dielectric material is eroded without significant etching of the mask. In effect, the mask acts as an erosion stop for the resultant structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</cross-reference>. Note that the erosion does not significantly affect the fill level between the lines and that the fill <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> between the lines remains below the upper surface as shown by dimension <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Now the mask <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is removed using, for instance, an ordinary step which selectively removes the silicon nitride without disturbing the underlying silicon and the fill <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. A hot phosphoric acid strip can remove the silicon nitride mask. A HF dip can then be used to remove the thin buffer oxide, if used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Following this, for the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E, a</cross-reference> thermally grown oxide is grown on the exposed upper surface of silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the lines <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, this oxide is grown at a temperature of 600&deg; C. in a steam atmosphere for one hour. This results in an antifuse layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of silicon dioxide having a nominal thickness of 50&angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The resultant structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</cross-reference> is shown by the silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the lines <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> protruding from the fill material. This protrusion assists in providing the enhanced programming. As shown within the circle <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>E, when the oxide is thermally grown it tends to be slightly thinner at the corners or edges of the polysilicon lines when compared to the central portion of the lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the silicon films of rail stack <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are formed over the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>E and patterned into transverse spaced-apart lines lying above the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</cross-reference> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14F</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Again referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14F, a</cross-reference> memory cell is formed where each of the lines <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> project into the sixth rail. Each cell has an antifuse layer (silicon dioxide layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>) disposed between the P type and the N type halves of a diode. To program these cells, the diode is forward biased with a potential great enough to rupture or breach the silicon dioxide layer. This causes a conductive path during memory read cycles through the cell when the diode is forward biased at a potential lower than that needed to program the cell. The breaks <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> in the layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> indicate that the cells associated with lines <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> are programmed. The layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> associated with the line <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> remains intact indicating that this cell is not programmed. Thus, two of the cells may be considered to be programmed with a binary 1 with the other containing a binary 0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>F, the ruptures <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> in layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> occur at the corners of the protruding silicon films of lines <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, respectively. The reason this occurs is because of the enhanced electric field associated with the edges of the lines and the thinner region of the layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which occurs during its growth at the edges as shown within the circle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</cross-reference>. Both of these factors or at least one of them is present to assist in programming. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Other Hard Mask Embodiments </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Another hard mask embodiment is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Once again for this embodiment the silicon lines <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> along with the fill <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are formed in the same manner as the corresponding structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>D, and the hard mask is removed. In this embodiment, rather than growing the antifuse layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, a deposited silicon dioxide layer is used. A plasma-enhanced CVD silicon dioxide layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is then deposited on the substrate. This layer also covers the fill <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> unlike the grown oxide of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</cross-reference>. This embodiment has the advantage of not requiring the higher temperature needed for growing an oxide. Once again the silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of lines <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> protrude from the fill <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. As shown within the circle <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>, the side of the line <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> protrudes into a thinner oxide region. This again provides for the enhanced programming as discussed above. When the fill is recessed sufficiently below the top surface of the silicon film <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the deposited oxide tends to be thinner on the sidewalls of the rails than on the top surface of the rails or on the fill dielectric as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, due to shadowing by the corners during deposition. In this embodiment, the antifuse layer tends to open along the protruding line closer to the fill rather than at the corner of the line when programmed. Thus, this embodiment is similar to the prior embodiment except that a deposited antifuse layer is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</cross-reference> show yet another hard mask embodiment where rather than protrusions, recessions in the antifuse layer in the central region of the polysilicon lines occur. Again, as was the case in the prior hard mask embodiments, the silicon layer is etched using a hard mask which is first patterned as shown by the masking features <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>C and the polysilicon line <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, respectively of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference>. The spaces between the lines are then filled with a fill material <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, again a material which is softer than the mask, this time however, to a level above the lower surface of the hard mask. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference> by the dimension <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, the fill <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is above the upper surface of the hard mask by for instance, 1000&angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> Once again, the fill accumulates on the hard mask as shown by the dielectric material <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> CMP or other planarization is used to planarize the wafer, with the mask acting as a stop. Now the mask is removed with a selective etchant which selects the silicon nitride over the thin silicon dioxide buffer film and silicon dioxide filling material. The resultant structure includes fill which is higher than the corresponding lines as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</cross-reference>. A silicon dioxide antifuse layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is deposited or grown over the wafer. When the antifuse is deposited by, for example PECVD, this results in a thinner silicon dioxide at the fill/silicon line interface <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> as shown within circle <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and a thicker antifuse in the region of the silicon lines between the edges of the line as shown by dimension <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. This may be used where it is desired, by way of example, to cause a breach of the antifuse during programming to occur at the edge <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> of the line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the described hard mask embodiments of the present invention include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The ability to consistently introduce array line protrusion or recession by using a polish stopping layer in combination with a slurry system that displays the required selectivities. This recession/ protrusion or lack thereof may be advantageous from a cell standpoint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The possibility of depositing significantly less sacrificial silicon as the terminal array material, decreasing device cost due to the need for less furnace time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Due to decreased stack heights as a result of the need for less sacrificial silicon, less etch time is needed to pattern the arrays, and less fill oxide deposition time is needed to fill the spaces. This decreases device costs by reducing fab capital expenditure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Increased ease in addressing depth-of-focus issues, since the narrow array features can tolerate longer overpolishing without eroding the active line material. Therefore wider features such as landing pads and scribe line structures can be cleared, avoiding the excessive topography that causes depth-of-focus problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The ability to exploit the body of knowledge in place for STI CMP, for example post-CMP cleans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> And perhaps most importantly, the invention provides a more reliable cell, particularly from the programming standpoint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Thus, an improved method for forming lines in a three-dimensional memory array and an antifuse layer has been described. </paragraph>
