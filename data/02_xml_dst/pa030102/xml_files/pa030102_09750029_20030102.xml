<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method and system is provided for data integration with interactive voice response systems. A telephony server receives a request for a call-back, issued by a user at a user station by selecting telephone information service via a web browser. The request may include a phone number to be used for the requested call-back and relevant customer information. The telephony server then places a phone call to a call center that provides the telephone information service and that includes comprising an interactive voice response system, an automatic call distributor, and a customer relation management system. The call, placed by the telephony server to the call center, delivers information relevant to the request to the automatic call distributor and the customer relation management system based on an interactive voice response tree used by the interactive voice response system. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Aspects of the present invention relate to telephone information services and customer support. Other aspects of the present invention relate to a providing live customer support via a call center. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. General Background and Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In today&apos;s highly competitive market, the quality of customer support often provides a competitive advantage to products and the companies that produce the products. A customer may include a client, a vendor, a user, or an employee. Measures used to quantify the quality of customer support may include the responsiveness of customer support personnel and the skill of the representatives or agents who interact with the customer. Responsiveness may be measured by how long it takes for a customer to receive the telephone information service. Skill of customer support personnel may be measured by how effectively the problem of a customer, that requires customer support, is resolved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To offer quality customer support, many companies provide call centers which customers may call with questions. These call centers are staffed by agents who help customers during phone conversations. Responsiveness is an indicator of how long a customer has to wait &lsquo;on hold&rsquo; until getting to talk to an agent. Skill of customer support personnel can be evaluated based on how many times a customer has to call to resolve the problem. The number of times needed may be attributed to the agent assigned to handle the customer&apos;s problems. That is, depending on the nature of the problem, agents with different skills are assigned to handle different categories of problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To improve the level of skill, a call center may be designed so as to utilize an effective interactive voice response system which prompts a customer, who calls for support, to answer various predetermined questions by making touch-tone responses on the phone. If these screening questions are carefully designed, they can identify the nature of the problem and help the customer get to agent with the appropriate skills and authority to effectively handle the customer&apos;s problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The responsiveness of a call center is related, at least in part, to the capacity of the call center and the volume of calls. When a call center has too few agents to provide telephone information service, a customer who calls for help may have to wait a long time until the call is answered by the next available agent. Of course, increasing the number of agents leads to increased cost, including salaries, training and other overhead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An alternative approach to improving the responsiveness of a call center is to introduce an automated call-back mechanism. Instead of requiring a calling customer to wait in line for an agent to answer the call, an interactive voice response system may be designed to monitor the call center (e.g., the number of customers currently waiting in line and the approximate number of minutes until the calling customer may be answered) and to offer a calling customer the opportunity to choose a call-back option. If the calling customer chooses the call-back option (instead of waiting), the customer is prompted to provide additional information including call-back phone number where the customer can be reached. The entered call-back phone number may then be stored in a queue at the call center, together with other information characterizing the request for help. This other information may specify the nature of the problem and the customer account number. This information can be retrieved later and used by an agent, selected based on the specified problem, to return the customer&apos;s call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another recently emerged customer service feature, is to allow a customer to activate a phone call to a call center via an Internet web page. Telephone information service offered by a call center may be accessed by clicking a button on a web page. When a customer clicks on the button, a phone call is initiated to the call center that supports the customer service. Currently implemented systems that facilitates such a feature do not forward relevant web-data, which may include information such as customer account number and the specification of the problem, to the call center. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Most of the call centers operating today do not have an automated call-back capability. Even though it would improve the quality of telephone information service by converting existing call centers that do not possess such capabilities to systems that support such capabilities, the conversion may require substantial investment and at the same time, cause disruption of the service provided by the original call center. Integrating existing call centers with web capabilities usually leads to the same consequences. It is beneficial to introduce new technologies that utilize existing call center systems and add new capabilities, such as web activation capability and automated call-back capability, to the existing call centers without introducing any disruption to the systems that are currently in operation.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a high level block diagram of a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, in which a telephony server, connecting a customer, via a browser server, and a call center, facilitates web activation and automated call-back capabilities based on an existing call center that does not possess the web activation and automated call-back capabilities. System <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a user station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a browser server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, a telephony server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a phone switching network <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and an agent station 1-N <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The Telephony server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> takes a user request for telephone information service (e.g., request for a call-back), issued by a user at the user station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> via a web page on the browser server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and converts the web request into a conventional phone call to the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, via the phone switching network <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. During the conversion, the Telephony server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> encodes the web information that is necessary for the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to execute the requested call-back according to the criteria adopted by an interactive voice response system in the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> so that the encoded results act the same way, in the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, as a conventional customer phone call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> When the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> receives the encoded information, it acts as a conventional call center, selecting an appropriate agent and routing the request to the selected agent. When the agent answers the routed call on a, for example, touch-tone phone, the Telephony server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> detects the availability of the agent and then automatically connects the agent with the customer who issues the web request for telephone information service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> This arrangement, system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, addresses the aspects of encoding the information contained in a call-back request, issued via a web page, into a DTMF string in accordance with an interactive voice response tree employed by an interactive voice response system in a call center so that necessary information can be routed appropriately, in the form similar to a phone call, to the call center which can deliver the information encoded in the DTMF strings to an agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a high level block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of the invention, in which data contained in a call-back request, issued by a user on a web page, is integrated with an interactive voice response system of a call center. System <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes the user station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the browser server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the Telephony server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the phone switching network <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and the agent station 1 through N <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. In system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a user or a customer, at the user station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, logs onto a web site, via the browser server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, from where the customer may seek telephone information service. The web site that provides the telephone information service may be hosted on the browser server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. To facilitate telephone information service, the Telephony server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may implement a button on the web site, representing telephone information service, so that the customer may request telephone information service from the web site by simply clicking on the button. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A request for telephone information service may request a call back from an agent connected to the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The request may also request telephone information service in a different form. For example, the customer may ask an agent to provide telephone information service through a co-browsing session between the customer and the agent. The customer may also request to get telephone information service through both a call-back as well as a co-browsing session with the agent. A co-browsing session may be helpful when the customer likes to show the agent some content listed on the web such as a bill containing a wrong charge. In this case, the customer may push a web page to the agent during the co-browsing session. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When telephone information service is requested by the customer at the user station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, relevant information necessary to facilitate the requested telephone information service may be specified by the customer. Such relevant information may include a call-back phone number (if a call-back is requested), a user ID representing the customer&apos;s login ID (if a co-browsing session is requested), the nature of the problem that needs telephone information service (so that an appropriate agent with proper skills can be selected), and the account number of the customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The request, issued via the web page together with the relevant information, is sent to the Telephony server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> via the browser server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Upon receiving the call-back request, including the relevant information, the Telephony server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> converts the web request into an appropriate phone call that encodes the relevant information necessary for the requested telephone information service and places the phone call, via the phone switching network <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, to the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> selects an agent according to the information provided with the request. For example, if a customer has problems with billing and requests telephone information service to solve the billing problem, the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may choose an agent who has the knowledge and skills related to billing problems. Once the agent is determined, the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> routes the call-back request to the selected agent. The routing may comprise placing a call to the agent station corresponding to the agent and displaying the relevant information supplied with the call-back request by the customer who requested the call-back on a display screen of the agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an exemplary configuration of the user station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The user station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a user <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, an Internet device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and a phone <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The Internet device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is a device that is capable of connecting to the Internet via a connection, in either wired or wireless fashion. Examples of such a device include a person computer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a laptop <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, or a Palm Pilot <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The user <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may log onto the browser server via an Internet device <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The phone <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may include a wired phone <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or a wireless phone <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A wireless phone may be a cordless phone or a cellular phone. The user <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may use the phone <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to receive a call-back, routed via the phone switch network <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, for telephone information service. The phone switching network <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be a conventional Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or a wireless communication network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> When the user <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> chooses, via a web page, telephone information service by clicking on a button on the web page corresponding to telephone information service, the user <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may be prompted to provide more relevant information, on the web page, that is necessary to complete the requested telephone information service. Such relevant information may include account number, nature of the problem that needs to be resolved through telephone information service, and the phone number for the requested call back. Once such information is collected, the user <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may submit the request, together with the provided relevant information, via the browser server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an exemplary block diagram of the Telephony server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and how the Telephony server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> interacts with the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the Telephony server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a receiver <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, a DTMF (Dual Touch-tone Multi Frequency) string generator <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, and a transmitter <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. The receiver <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> receives a request for a call-back from the user <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, issued from a web page via the browser server <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Together with the request, the receiver <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may also obtain relevant information supplied by the user <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The receiver <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may parse the relevant information and separate different pieces of information and label them. The receiver <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may also extract certain information. For example, the receiver <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may extract a call-back phone number and a customer account from rest of the information. Correctly parsing different pieces of information allows the Telephony server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to encode the call-back request properly before forwarding the request to the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The parsed information generated by the receiver <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is fed to the DTMF string generator <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. The DTMF string generator <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is to generate a DTMF string that encodes different pieces of the relevant information supplied by the user <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> from the web. The DTMF string generator <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> converts a web request, issued by the user <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, into a phone request, in certain fashion, that can be sent to the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> as a regular phone call request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, when a customer places a phone call to a call center for telephone information service, the customer&apos;s call may be answered by an automatic interactive voice response system. The automatic interactive voice response system may ask the customer to answer a series of pre-phrased questions via a touch-tone phone. The questions may be asked in a pre-defined order, which is specified by an interactive voice response tree embedded in the interactive voice response system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Examples of such questions, asked by a conventional interactive voice response system, include &ldquo;To establish a new account, press 1, for customer service on your existing account, press 2 . . . &rdquo; and &ldquo;. . . . Please enter your 8-digit account number now . . . &rdquo;. The answers from the customer, entered from the phone via touch-tones, are recorded, in this case, as a DTMF string. For example, if the customer presses 2 for customer service on an existing account, as the answer for the first example question, and then entered the account number from the touch-tone phone, as the answer to the second example question, the DTMF string generated based on the answers may be &ldquo;2P45363432&rdquo;. In this DTMF string, the first &ldquo;2&rdquo; represents the choice for customer service on an existing account, &ldquo;P&rdquo; indicates the pause between two different answers, and &ldquo;45363432&rdquo; represents the account number of the customer. How a DTMF string is formed depends on the sequence of the questions. That is, the format of a DTMF string is determined by the interactive voice response tree used by the corresponding interactive voice response system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> When a DTMF string encodes information according to the interactive voice response tree, the interactive voice response system is able to identify each piece of information based on their relative positions in the DTMF string. For example, assuming the second question from an interactive voice response tree is to enter the account number, to identify the user&apos;s account number, the interactive voice response system can easily locate the account information from a DTMF string by identifying the information between the first pause &ldquo;P&rdquo; and the second pause &ldquo;P&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the DTMF string generator <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> takes the parsed request as input and encodes different pieces of the relevant information into a DTMF string. The encoding is performed according to the interactive voice response tree <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>used by the interactive voice response system <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> of the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. For example, if the user <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> provides, via a web page, the account information in a call-back request, the DTMF string generator <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> generates a DTMF string, in which the account information is inserted at the correct position, defined by the interactive voice response tree <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In this way, the interactive voice response system <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is able to extract the account information from the DTMF string based on their positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As another example, if the user <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> issues a call-back request via a web page (instead of via a phone call) and provides account number with the request. The DTMF string generator <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, using the parsed account number from the receiver <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, generates a DTMF string, according to the interactive voice response tree <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, containing &ldquo;2P45363432&rdquo;. To do so, the DTMF string generator <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> may be required to accommodate the interactive voice response tree <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by automatically creating some of the answers to the questions that are in the interactive voice response tree <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>-<highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>but may not be on the web page. One example is the pause &ldquo;P&rdquo;. Another example is the answer &ldquo;2&rdquo; in the above example of using a phone call to request customer service which may not have a corresponding question on a web page from where the customer may also request customer service. In this case, to generate a proper DTMF string in accordance with the interactive voice response tree <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the DTMF string generator <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> may automatically insert a &ldquo;2P&rdquo;, in front of the account string &ldquo;45363432&rdquo;, into the DTMF string, even though this created answer is not specified by the customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Once a DTMF string is generated by the DTMF string generator <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, it is sent, through the transmitter <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, to the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Since the request is made through a web page and the relevant information associated with the request is encoded directly into a DTMF string, the transmitter <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> inserts directly the DTMF string into the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> of the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. In effect, compared with a conventional phone call for customer service, in which a DTMF string is generated based on the customer&apos;s responses on the phone, the Telephony server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> generates a call to the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> by automatically generating the DTMF string based on a web request, and inserts the DTMF string directly into the IVR system <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> of the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Once the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> receives the DTMF string, it uses the information encoded in the DTMF string to route the call to an appropriate agent via a call routing mechanism <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is described in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, includes an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> embedded with an IVR tree <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, a Customer Relation Management (CRM) system <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, and an ACD gate <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. The call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> accepts a request via its IVR system <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> via a DTMF string, encoded according to the IVR tree <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(which defines a sequence of questions), and inserts appropriate information into the ACD <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> or the CRM <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Certain information needs to be inserted into the CRM system <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. For example, in order to maintain a good customer relationship, it may be helpful to record the information about which customer needs customer service when with what problem and how often. To effectively route a call to an agent for customer service, it may be helpful to know what problem the customer is having so that an appropriate agent with needed skills can be assigned to help the customer to solve the problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> With appropriate information, gathered from the user <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> on the web, directly inserted into the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in the form of a DTMF string, in effect, the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> receives a request, similar to a request made through a phone call. The ACD <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> then selects an agent according to the needed skills to solve the problem that the customer is having. The request is then sent to the selected agent, via the ACD gate <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, in the form of a routed call to the agent station <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows an exemplary configuration of the agent station <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. An agent station connects to the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and includes an agent <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, a phone <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, a display device <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>, and a worskstation <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>. A call requesting a call-back for telephone information service is routed to the phone <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> at the agent station <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> as a routed call from the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. When the routed call reaches the phone <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, it rings. When the agent <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> answers the routed call, customer information related to the requested call-back (e.g., customer account) is sent from the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to the agent station <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and displayed on the display device <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> of the workstation <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is an exemplary flowchart of the process, in which a web generated request for a call-back for telephone information service, with the relevant information entered together with the request, is routed, through a call center, to an agent with relevant information automatically displayed on the agent&apos;s display screen. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> customer first selects, at act <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, telephone information service on a web page by clicking a button representing telephone information service. The request may include the information relevant to the request call-back such as customer account information and the phone number to be used for the call-back. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The request, together with the relevant information, is received, at act <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, by the Telephony server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Based on the IVR tree <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the IVR system <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, the Telephony server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> generates, at act <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight>, a DTMF string that encodes the request and the relevant information according to the IVR tree <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The generated DTMF string is then sent, at act <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight>, from the Telephony server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to the IVR system <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> of the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Different pieces of information, contained in the relevant information and parsed and encoded according to the IVR tree <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, are inserted, at act <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight>, into the ACD system <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and the CRM system <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> of the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Based on the relevant information, the ACD system <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> then selects appropriate agent with requested skills and routes the request for a call-back, at act <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight>, to the selected agent. When the agent answers the routed call, the call center <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> routes, at act <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight>, the relevant information to the display screen of the agent station of the workstation <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
