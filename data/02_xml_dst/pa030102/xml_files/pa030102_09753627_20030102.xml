<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Device includes a cover and a face provided on the cover. Cover may include a window sufficiently clear so that a portion of an object on which the cover is disposed can be viewed through the window. The window may serve to magnify or reduce the image of the viewed object. The window may be a clear, colored window to vary the apparent color of the viewed object. Likewise, the window may be a clear colorless window. The window may include an outer and inner layer of material enclosing a fluid, such as a gas or liquid, to protect the viewed object, such as the viewed keypad of a cellular telephone. The fluid may include one or more liquids, one or more of which may be of different colors so that when the window is pressed, different patterns are viewed in the liquid. The pressing of the liquid may likewise cause objects, such as logos or toys suspended in the liquid to move about in the liquid to enhance the effect. The thickness of the layers and the volume of the fluid may be select so as the protect the viewed object, such as the keys of a telephone, as well as to prevent inadvertent actuation of an ON/OFF button on the covered object. The cover may be in any desired configuration, including anthropomorphic and animal-like shapes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include a first layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a second layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and a third layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> First and second layers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be sufficiently clear so that a portion of an object disposed within cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is visible from outside the cover. One or both of layers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be clear and either colored or colorless. For example, at least one of first and second layers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be clear and colorless while the other one of the layers may be clear and blue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Third layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> would be disposed between first and second layers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be a fluid, such as a gas, and/or a liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the case where layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is a fluid, good results have been achieved when third layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes first and second fluids, as will be described in detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows another embodiment of a cover showing how a face <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the cover may include a window <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, window <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> covers substantially the entire face of the cover, as in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. It is contemplated that window <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of face <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, for example, is located in the vicinity of a keypad of an electronic device received in the cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates another embodiment of the invention similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a section A-A. That section A-A is shown in two (2) different ways on the left of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. At the top left of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it is shown how third layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may include a first fluid <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a second fluid <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. As shown in the bottom left figure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> first fluid <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be a clear blue fluid and second fluid <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be a clear yellow fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated that first and second fluids <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> be immiscible liquids, so that the blue and yellow colors, for example, remain distinct, (i.e., unmixed over time). In that manner, interesting patterns may develop owing to the fluids moving relative to each other and owing to the user pressing against one or both of first and second layers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> It has been found that this feature works well when the user is using the keypad of an electronic device disposed within the cover, when the user presses against the exterior one of first and second layers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> pressure is applied to fluid layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. In that manner, fluid layer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is caused to be compressed and, thus, typically made thinner at the point where pressure is applied. The movement of the fluid away from that pressure point caused by the user&apos;s finger disturbs the pattern of the first and second fluids <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> that had resulted during the quiescent (non-use) state of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Good results have also been achieved when the cover receives a device, such as a digital or cellular telephone with backlighted keys on its keypad, such as are in widespread use today. In that manner, the backlighting of the keys adds to the visual interest when one or more of the first, second, or third layers is a clear colored layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also illustrates the use of a movable element <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which may be a decorative element, such as the illustrated glitter that substantially freely moves around within the fluid layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates another embodiment in which moveable elements <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are in the form of toys, such as the illustrated soccer player <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, some of the moveable elements <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are in the form of corresponding soccer balls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, by which the user can press against one or more of soccer players <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and apply pressure in a manner so as to cause player <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to approach soccer ball <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and &ldquo;kick&rdquo; soccer balls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A strap <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be applied to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and to any of the other embodiments according to the invention. Strap <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be in the form of a wrist strap or a neck strap. </paragraph>

This cover has a window <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which may be as described above with multiple layers, or may be a single layer of plastic, for example, provided on the rear thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Self-closing fastener <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> may be used for attaching cover <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to a child&apos;s pants or the user&apos;s backpack, for example. In that manner the electronic device is less likely to be forgotten. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates another preferred embodiment of a cover <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> similar to the cover of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> that has a window <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> on the front side of the figure. A pull <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> which may be in the form of an animal tail can be provided for providing enhancing usability of the illustrated zipper for opening the cover for inserting the portable electronic device therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates another animate <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 110</cross-reference> in the form of a cat having a cat&apos;s head <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and a cat tail <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> embodiment may be made by substituting cat&apos;s head <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for the head of the bear <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> illustrate another preferred embodiment of a cover according to the invention, similar to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> shows the face, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> shows the rear when closed, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> shows the rear of the cover when open so as to allow insertion of a device into the cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> show a still further preferred embodiment of a cover <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> according to the invention. Cover <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is particularly suited for use with electronic devices such as pagers. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> shows the face of the cover when closed, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> shows the rear of the cover when closed, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference> shows the face of the cover when open, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference> shows the rear of the cover when open. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, cover <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> includes a first side <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>A and a second side <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>B detachably attached thereto by use of a first fastener <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>A and a second faster <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>B, for example. A single fastener or multiple fasteners can be used as will be appreciated. Fasteners <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>B may conveniently be made of the hook portion and the loop portion of hook-and-loop fasteners respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> A window <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> may be provided through which the user views the keypad and/or display of a pager disposed therein, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> A fastener may be provided for opening and closing an opening in the interior or the cover for insertion and removal of the pager, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</cross-reference> illustrate a cover <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> similar to some of the above embodiments in which a soccer player(s) <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and a ball(s) <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> are provided, and used as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference> shows the face thereof and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</cross-reference> shows the rear thereof. A further pocket, such as the illustrated mesh holder may be provided for carrying an additional electronic device, keys or writing instruments, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated that any of a variety of synthetic and natural materials be used for the illustrated and described elements set forth herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The immiscible liquids may include oil and water, gels, and gases such as air. The illustrated figures are merely examples, and additional animals other than bears and cats are contemplated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The layer(s) of the window in the various embodiments prevent the keys of the keypad placed behind the window, in use, from being inadvertently actuated. The thickness of the first, second, and third layers can be varied to achieve the desired protection from blows and from inadvertently actuation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Prior art covers often allow accidental pressing and, hence, actuation of the &ldquo;POWER&rdquo; key that leads to undesirable battery discharge, thus rendering the device inoperable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> A liquid third layer, for example, prevents such inadvertent actuation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The layer(s) also reduce/eliminate harm to the covered device from blows by the person or other objects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The layer(s) may be made of soft, flexible material, as well as hard plastic material. Such hard plastic material likewise may serve to protect the keypad of the covered object. The hard plastic may be in the form of a lenticular face surrounded by the remainder of the cover and/or a surround of relatively soft plastic. The lenticular cover may serve as an enlarging (or reducing) lens to enlarge (or reduce) the size of the keypad fom the viewpoint of the user, as discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In addition to floating objects, such as the toys (e.g., soccer player) described above, it is contemplated that trademarks, symbols, logos, and the like be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> All covers may be made with or without gel as an inner layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The layer(s) may also be used to make the keys on the keypad placed in the cover easier to read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The layer(s) may be normally convex when a device is in the cover and no keys are being depressed. Such convex shape is shown in various ones of the figures on the attached Figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Good results have been achieved when the third layer is a liquid layer which magnifies the button on a cellular telephone, for example. The liquid(s) of the liquid layer are selected so as to achieve the desired readiblity by magnifying the image of the keys as viewed by the user with the desired degree of magnification and clarity of the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> One or more of the first, second, and third layers can be sized and selected for achieving the desired magnification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The image seen by the viewer can be distorted, with or without magnification, as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated, the layers may be made convex; i.e., bowed outwardly toward the user in order to achieve magnification from the window/layer(s) acting as a magnifying convex lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the window/layer(s) may be disposed so as to be a concave, image reducing lens, in use. By &ldquo;concave&rdquo; it is meant that the layer(s) are bowed outwardly away from the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In the case where the third layer is a fluid (liquid or gas), when the user presses against the layer(s), the layer(s) will become more concave at the pressure point under the user&apos;s finger. And the liquid will flow toward other regions above the non-depressed keys. In that manner, the layer(s) will be more convex above the next key(s) which is to be depressed by the user. Thus, it has been found that the key(s) which is to be pressed next in the keystroke sequence will be even easier to see thanks to the more convex region of the layer(s) above the next key yielding greater magnification of the next key. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the image seen by the viewer can be distorted, with or without magnification to achieve an unusual visual effect, as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> It has been found that blue, green, red, and yellow layers are particularly easy to see. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been described as having a preferred design, it is understood that it is capable of further modifications, and uses and/or adaptations of the invention and following in general the principle of the invention and including such departures from the present disclosure as come within the known or customary practice in the art to which the invention pertains, and as may be applied to the central features hereinbefore set forth, and fall within the scope of the invention or limits of the claims appended hereto. </paragraph>
