<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An apparatus and method used in intra-oral dental x-ray imaging equipment provides automatic detection of the x-ray emission in order to obtain timely transition to the image integration and acquisition phase with high level of rejection of false triggering induced by blemish defects of the image sensor or by variations of the ambient and temperature conditions. A solid state imager, such as a CCD image sensor, is continually clocked during the standby phase prior to irradiation from an X-ray source, so providing on same time an output signal proportional to the accumulated dark current and the continuous removal of the same. A control unit analyses the output signal of the imager, detects the variation caused by the start of the x-ray emission using appropriate threshold levels, and automatically triggers the imager to the image integration and acquisition phases. Based on memorised maps of the imager blemish defects, and continually monitored variations of the imager output signal, the control unit will reject false triggering due to imager defects or variations of the ambient and temperature conditions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> CCD and other types of solid state imagers have got widespread use in dental and medical radiology for their ability to provide in real time x-ray images of high diagnostic value, with reduced levels of the X-ray dose imparted to the patient versus the conventional radiographic film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the most typical arrangement the imager is in a wait state, and requires to be triggered into an integration state as soon as the irradiation starts, where the imager clocking is suspended and the x-ray conversion charge is accumulated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is one desirable feature that the triggering to the integration state occurs in an automatic way, without need of connections to the x-ray generator, using as low as possible x-ray dose threshold to minimise useless x-ray dosage to the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In case that such automatic triggering is adopted, adequate provision is also desirable against occurrence of false triggering, as it may be caused by variations in the image sensor output signal due to abnormal imager defects and/or variations of the ambient and temperature conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For the intrinsic characteristics of the imager, usually a remarkable dark current is spontaneously generated, which is having a negative impact on the noise performance of the diagnostic image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is another desirable feature that appropriate technique is used to remove the generated dark current and its effects on the acquired image. It is also desirable that the method used to remove the dark current will have a minimised impact on the power consumption of the imaging system, to favour those applications where the imaging system is to be self powered from the communication port of the computer station without need of additional external power supply and cabling, and easy portability of the imaging system between different computer stations shall be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Prior art automatic x-ray detection apparatus have been based on an electrical connection with the x-ray generator, where a control signal is generated synchronised with the start of the exposure, to be used by the imager to automatically switch into integration mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Such arrangement is clearly disadvantageous for the need of having an electrical connection with the x-ray generator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In other prior art arrangements one or more x-ray detectors, such as photo diodes, are located close to the imaging area and are used to provide detection of the x-ray emission and switching of the imager to integration mode, by a suitable control signal sent to the control electronics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Such arrangement is inherently more expensive, although characterised by a prompt reaction time, and does not provide the collateral advantage of removing the accumulated dark current as provided by the continuous clocking and readout method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In other prior art arrangements the imager is continuously clocked and readout during standby mode prior to irradiation, the video output signal produced by the imager is compared with a threshold level by using a comparator circuit, if the threshold level is exceeded the imager is automatically switched into integration mode. As a variation of this arrangement the threshold level may be continually adjusted to account for variations of the temperature and ambient conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> This arrangement is disadvantageous because it requires an external analogue circuit for the comparison and does not allow for sophisticated processing of the video output in order to prevent false triggering caused by abnormal imager defects. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The object of the invention is an automatic x-ray detection apparatus and method for x-ray digital imagers for dental and medical application, capable of producing automatic triggering of the imager to the integration mode with immediate reaction to the start of the x-ray emission, and including provision against occurrence of false triggering caused by variations in the image sensor output signal due to abnormal imager defects and/or variations of the ambient and temperature conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The method adopted will ensure at the same time effective removal of the dark current spontaneously generated in the imager, with minimised impact on the power consumption of the imaging system, while the apparatus will perform its function without need of electrical connections to the x-ray generator and will use the processing power of the existing microcontroller, without need of additional comparator circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The invention is particularly advantageous for the dental and medical x-ray diagnosis, where the outlined features find immediate application, but it could also be advantageously employed in other non medical applications having similar requirements. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The system illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a typical x-ray diagnostic system dedicated to dental intra-oral radiography with digital image acquisition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The x-ray source <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is aligned with the image receptor <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (the x-ray imager) by means of a suitable alignment device. The imager is located in the patient mouth, behind the object (tooth) to be imaged. It is connected to the control unit <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, providing imager control and image acquisition and transfer to the main processor <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (i.e. the Personal Computer), where the diagnostic image display, processing and archive is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The x-ray imager is a solid state device including a matrix of radiation sensitive pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Solid state imagers, such as CCD devices, are in general exhibiting spontaneous generation of dark current, which is in turn generating a noise signal increasing, by know relations, with the temperature and with the time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As this noise signal may significantly use the signal range of the device, it is imperative that adequate provision is taken to remove its contribution from the useful image signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In the proposed arrangement a continuous read out of the imager is performed during the wait time before irradiation, and the output signal is converted in digital form and analysed by the control unit, with the multiple purpose of (1) detecting variations of the output signal versus a threshold reference which can be correlated with the start of the irradiation, (2) rejecting variations of the output signal which are caused by abnormal blemish defects of the imager, (3) providing simulation of the imager temperature and accordingly correction of the threshold reference based on the actual device temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The same read out process will ensure the cyclic removal of the dark current during the wait time, so minimising its influence on the latent image which will build into the imager during the integration mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The read out process during wait time will also adopt adequate strategy to minimise the power consumption. This will result particularly favourable in those applications where the power consumption shall be reduced to allow easy portability of the imaging system between different computer stations and self powering from the communication port of the same computer station, without need of additional external power supply and cabling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Of course dark current will spontaneously generate during the integration and acquisition phases as well. Know methods are available to reduce this influence either by techniques to minimise the dark current generation into the solid state device, or by providing a subtraction of a dummy image build up without irradiation using similar integration time as used during the irradiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The automatic x-ray detection apparatus incorporates several functions, which are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and are described below: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> IBM (Initial Blemishes Mapping). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> &emsp;This functional unit performs an initial read out of the whole imager pixel matrix, with the purpose of creating a map of the pixels showing blemish defect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> &emsp;In a first arrangement, the output signal from each imager matrix pixel is analysed and the pixels having signal in excess of a predefined threshold reference quantity are individually recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> &emsp;In another preferred arrangement the imager matrix may be divided into sections and within each section the pixels may be grouped and added together (so creating a super-pixel), to collect a significant signal and to reproduce the same readout policy adopted during the standby readout (see the following SRC function). The output signal from each super-pixel is analysed and, for each imager section, the super-pixels having signal in excess of a predefined threshold reference quantity are individually recorded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> &emsp;It has to be noticed that, by performing such initial readout at each power on of the control unit, it is ensured the immediate recording of any new pixel blemishes which may generate into the imager device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> (a) SRC (Standby Readout Cycle). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> &emsp;This functional unit performs a cyclic read out of the imager matrix during the standby phase, producing the output O(i,j) at each cycle (i), where j is index of the output element. The read out will have the consequential effect of removing at each cycle the dark current accumulated in all pixels of the matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> &emsp;In a first arrangement, the whole imager matrix is read out pixel by pixel, and an output signal is generated referred to each individual pixel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> &emsp;In a second preferred arrangement the imager matrix may be divided into sections and within each section the pixels may be grouped and added together (so creating a super-pixel), with the purpose of collecting a significant signal for the comparison. In this arrangement the output signal will be referred to each super-pixel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> &emsp;As a variant of the second arrangement, it may be particularly advantageous in applications where the minimisation of the power consumption is required, such as for example CCD imagers with control electronics self powered from the USB port of a Personal Computer, to adopt a low power read out strategy, by using the reduction of the amount of the high frequency pixel shifts in the readout register, which typically provide a major contribution to the on chip power consumption. It can be achieved for example by shifting first all the lines of a section into the readout register, and then shifting all the pixels of the readout register to the output circuit. The amount of low frequency line shifts should therefore be maximised, taking also in consideration eventual limitations associated with the full-well capacity of the readout register elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> (b) XDU (X-ray Detection Unit). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> &emsp;This functional unit processes the output generated by the SRC function, in order to identify the start of the irradiation and consequently generate a control signal to trigger the transition of the imager to integration mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> &emsp;In the preferred arrangement a multiple threshold will be used, with the purpose of ensuring at the same time fast response to the start of irradiation and high level of filtration of the noise components (thermal noise, dark current). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> &emsp;The output signal O(i,j) generated by the SRC function at the cycle (i) will be compared with a first threshold (TH1), to identify the pixels, or super-pixels, providing x-ray stimulated output signal. The number of such pixels will then be counted, and will be compared with a second threshold (TH2). In case that such number will exceed the second Threshold Reference (TH2), the start of irradiation will be identified and a control signal will be generated to trigger the transition of the imager to integration mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> &emsp;Output values which exceed the TH1 level, but which also correspond to pixels or super-pixels previously identified by the IBM function as blemishing, will be rejected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> &emsp;In an alternative arrangement the start of irradiation may be identified by the simple detection of the first output signal exceeding the first threshold TH1. This arrangement is characterised by fast response but lower capacity of filtration of the noise components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Another alternative arrangement may use a derivative approach, by comparing with a TH1 threshold the variation of the output signal between adjacent pixels or super-pixels. This arrangement is also characterised by fast response, but very low filtration of the noise components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Another alternative arrangement may use an integrative approach, by integrating the output signal and comparing the integrated value with a threshold TH1. This arrangement is characterised by a slow response, but a high level of filtration of the noise components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> (c) TSU (Temperature Simulation Unit). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> &emsp;This functional unit performs a simulation of the imager temperature and accordingly a correction of the first Threshold Reference (TH1) value, to account for variations of the dark current related pixel (or super-pixel) signal in consequence of variations of the device temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Generally the simulation T(i) of the imager temperature at the cycle (i) will be a function f&lsqb;O(i,j)&rsqb; of the output O(i,j) generated by the SRC function at the cycle (i). In the preferred arrangement the function f&lsqb;O(i,j)&rsqb; will be the average over a consistent number of pixels, or super-pixels, which were not identified as blemishing by the IBM function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The calculation of the Threshold Reference 1 Corrected TH1c(i) will be generally obtained as a function f&lsqb;TH1c(i&minus;1), T(i)&rsqb; of the simulated temperature T(i) at the cycle (i) and of the Threshold Reference 1 Corrected TH1c(i&minus;1) at the cycle (i&minus;1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> &emsp;In the preferred arrangement the Threshold Reference 1 Corrected TH1c(i) at the cycle (i) will be obtained by adding to the Threshold Reference 1 Corrected (TH1c) at the cycle (i&minus;1) a term derived by the simulated temperature T(i) multiplied by a constant scaling factor(0&lt;k&lt;1), according to the relation </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>TH</italic></highlight>1<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>)&equals;(1&minus;<highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight>)*<highlight><italic>TH</italic></highlight>1<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i&minus;</italic></highlight>1)&plus;<highlight><italic>k*T</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>). </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The preferred arrangement will provide smoothed response with higher rejection of noise terms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Based on the functional units above, the method of this invention will be based on the following steps (refer also to the flow chart in illustration 2): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> 1) After switch on of the apparatus, an initial readout of the imager matrix is performed, by the IBM function, to generate a map of the pixels (or super-pixels) showing blemish defect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> 2) During the standby phase, a cyclic read out of the imager matrix is performed, using the SRC function. At each cycle (i) the functional unit will generate the outputO(i,j), where (j) is the index of the element. The read out may be executed either by pixel or by super-pixel, eventually sub-dividing the imager area in sections. The read out will have the consequential effect of removing at each cycle the dark current accumulated in all pixels of the matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> 3) The output of the SRC function is analysed by the TSU function, in order to provide a simulated value of the device temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> &emsp;The simulated temperature value T(i) at the cycle (i) is used to calculate the Threshold Reference 1 Corrected TH1c(i) for the XDU function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> 4) The output of the SRC function is also used by the XDU function, to detect the start of irradiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> &emsp;In the preferred arrangement the output signal will be compared with a first threshold 1 (TH1), to identify the pixels, or super-pixels, providing x-ray stimulated output signal. The number of such pixels will then be counted, and will be compared with a second threshold (TH2). In case that such number will exceed the second Threshold Reference (TH2), the start of irradiation will be identified and a control signal will be generated to trigger the transition of the imager to integration mode. </paragraph>

<claim-text>In the preferred arrangement the output O(i,j) produced by the SRC functional unit will be compared with a first threshold 1 (TH1), to identify the pixels, or super-pixels, providing x-ray stimulated output signal. The number of such pixels, or super-pixels, will then be counted, and will be compared with a second threshold (TH2). In case that the count will exceed the second Threshold Reference (TH2), the start of irradiation will be identified and a control signal will be generated to trigger the transition of the imager to integration mode. </claim-text>
