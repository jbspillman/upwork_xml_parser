<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The soybean, <highlight><italic>Glycine max </italic></highlight>(L.) Merril (<highlight><italic>Glycine max </italic></highlight>or soybean), is one of the major economic crops grown worldwide as a primary source of vegetable oil and protein (Sinclair and Backman, <highlight><italic>Compendium of Soybean Diseases, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight></italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>rd </superscript></highlight>Ed. APS Press, St. Paul, Minn., p. 106. (1989)). The growing demand for low cholesterol and high fiber diets has also increased soybean&apos;s importance as a health food. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Prior to 1940, soybean cultivars were either direct releases of introductions brought from Asia or pure line selections from genetically diverse plant introductions. The soybean plant was primarily used as a hay crop in the early part of the 19th century. Only a few introductions were large-seeded types useful for feed grain and oil production. From the mid 1930&apos;s through the 1960&apos;s, gains in soybean seed yields were achieved by changing the breeding method from evaluation and selection of introduced germplasm to crossing elite by elite lines. The continuous cycle of cross hybridizing the elite strains selected from the progenies of previous crosses resulted in the modem day cultivars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Over 10,000 soybean strains have now been introduced into the United States since the early 1900&apos;s (Bernard et al., <highlight><italic>United States National Gennplasm Collections. </italic></highlight>In: L. D. Hil (ed.), World Soybean Research, pp. 286-289. Interstate Printers and Publ., Danville, Ill. (1976)). A limited number of those introductions form the genetic base of cultivars developed from the hybridization and selection programs (Johnson and Bernard, The Soybean, Norman Ed., Academic Press, N.Y., pp. 1-73 (1963)). For example, in a survey conducted by Specht and Williams, <highlight><italic>Genetic Contributions, </italic></highlight>Fehr eds. American Soil Association, Wisconsin, pp. 49-73 (1984), for the 136 cultivars released from 1939 to 1989, only 16 different introductions were the source of cytoplasm for 121 of that 136. Certain soybean strains are sensitive to one or more pathogens. One economically important pathogen is SCN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> SCN accounts for roughly 40% of the total disease in soybean and can result in significant yield losses (up to 90%). SCN is the most destructive pest of soybean to date and accounts for an estimated yield loss of up to $809 million dollars annually. Currently, the most cost effective control measures are crop rotation and the use of host plant resistance. While breeders have successfully developed SCN resistant soybean lines, breeding is both difficult and time consuming due to the complex and polygenic nature of resistance. The resistance is often race specific and does not provide stability over time due to changing SCN populations in the field. In addition, many of the resistant soybean varieties carry a significant yield penalty when grown in the absence of SCN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> SCN, <highlight><italic>Heterodera glycines Ichinohe, </italic></highlight>was identified on soybeans in the United States in 1954 at Castle Hayne, N.C. Winstead, et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Dis. Rep. </italic></highlight>39:9-11 (1955). Since its discovery the SCN has been recognized as one of the most destructive pests in soybean. It has been reported in nearly all states in which soybeans are grown, and it causes major production problems in several states, being particularly destructive in the Midwestern states. See generally: Caldwell, et al., <highlight><italic>Agron. J. </italic></highlight>52:635-636 (1960); Rao-Arelli and Anand, <highlight><italic>Crop. Sci. </italic></highlight>28:650-652, (1988); Baltazar and Mansur, <highlight><italic>Soybean Genet. Newsl. </italic></highlight>19:120-122 (1992); Concibido, et al., <highlight><italic>Crop. Sci., (</italic></highlight>1993). For example, sensitive soybean cultivars had 5.7-35.8% lower seed yields than did resistant cultivars on SCN race-3 infested sites in Iowa. (Niblack and Norton, <highlight><italic>Plant Dis. </italic></highlight>76:943-948 (1992)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Shortly after the discovery of SCN in the United States, sources of SCN resistance were identified (Ross and Brim, <highlight><italic>Plant Dis. Rep. </italic></highlight>41:923-924 (1957)). Some lines such as Peking and Plant Introduction (PI) PI88788, were quickly incorporated into breeding programs. Peking became widely used as a source of resistance due to its lack of agronomically undesirable traits, with Pickett as the first SCN resistant cultivar released (Brim and Ross, <highlight><italic>Crop Sci. </italic></highlight>6:305 (1966)). The recognition that certain SCN resistant populations could overcome resistant cultivars lead to an extensive screen for additional sources of SCN resistance. PI88788 emerged as a popular source of race 3 and 4 resistance even though it had a cyst index greater than 10% (but less than 20%) against race 4, and Peking and its derivatives emerged as a popular source for races 1 and 3. PI437654 was subsequently identified as having resistance to all known races and its SCN resistance was backcrossed into Forrest. Currently there are more than 130 PIs known to have SCN resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> SCN race 3 is considered to be the prominent race in the Midwestern soybean producing states. Considerable effort has been devoted to the genetics and breeding for resistance to race 3. While both Peking and PI88788 are resistant to SCN race 3, classical genetics studies suggest that they harbor different genes for race 3 resistance (Rao-Arelli and Anand, <highlight><italic>Crop Sci. </italic></highlight>28:650-652 (1988)). Crosses between PI88788(R) and Essex(S) segregate 9(R): 55(S) in the F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>population and 1(R): 26(Seg): 37(S) families in the F<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>generation, suggesting that resistance to race 3 in PI88788 is conditioned by one recessive and two dominant genes, where as Peking and PI90763 resistance is conditioned by one dominant and two recessive genes. Based on reciprocal crosses, Peking, Forrest, and PI90763 have genes in common for resistance to SCN race 3 (Rao-Arelli and Anand, <highlight><italic>Crop Sci., </italic></highlight>28:650-652 (1988)). A cross between Peking and PI88788 segregates 13(R):3(S) in the F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>generation, indicating a major difference between the parents for race 3 resistance. Generation mean analysis based on four crosses between resistant and sensitive genotypes; A20 (R), Jack (R), Cordell (R) and A2234 (S), suggests that an additive genetic model is sufficient to explain most of the genetic variation of race 3 SCN resistance in each cross, while the analysis of the pooled data indicates the presence of dominant effects as well (Mansur, Carriquiry and Roa-Arelli, <highlight><italic>Crop Sci. </italic></highlight>33:1249-1253 (1993)). This analysis further indicates that race 3 resistance is probably under the genetic control of three, but not more than four genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> RFLP analysis of segregating populations between resistant and sensitive lines; PI209332 (R), PI90763 (R), PI88788 (R), Peking (R) and Evan (S), identified a major SCN resistance QTL (rhg1) which maps to linkage group G (Concibido et al., <highlight><italic>Theor Appl. Genet. </italic></highlight>93:234-241 (1996)). In this study, rhg1 explains 51.4% of the phenotypic variation in PI209322, 52.7% of the variation in PI90763, 40.0% of the variation in PI88788 and 28.1% of the variation in Peking. This major resistance QTL was assumed be one and the same in all of the mapping populations employed. However, as pointed out by the authors, it is possible that the genomic interval contains distinct but tightly linked QTLs. In a related study using PI209332 as the source of resistance, Concibido et al., <highlight><italic>Crop Sci. </italic></highlight>36:1643-1650 (1996), show that a QTh on linkage group G (rhg1) is effective against the three SCN races tested, explaining 35% of the phenotypic variation to race 1, 50% of the variation to race 3, and 54% of the variation to race 6. In addition to the major QTL on linkage group G, 4 other QTLs mapping to linkage groups D, J, L and K were identified, with some of the resistance loci behaving in a race specific manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Concibido et al. (<highlight><italic>Crop Sci. </italic></highlight>37:258-264 (1997)) found significant association of marker C006V to a major QTL on linkage group G (rhg1) and resistance to race 1, race 3 and race 6, in Peking and PI90763 (Evan X Peking, Evan X PI90763) and races 3 and 6 in PI88788 (Evan X PI88788), in agreement with the previous study based on the P209332 source of resistance (Concibido et al., <highlight><italic>Crop Sci. </italic></highlight>36:1643-1650 (1996)). The resistance locus near C006V was effective against all races tested in all of the resistance sources. While statistically significant against all races, this locus accounts for different proportions of the total phenotypic variation with the races tested. For example, in PI90763 the resistance locus near C006V explains more than three times the phenotypic variation against race 1 than against race 3. The variability can be attributed to differences in the genetic backgrounds, variability among the SCN populations or may be a reflection of the limited size of the plant populations which were employed. This study further identified three additional independent SCN resistance QTLs; one near the RFLP marker A378H mapping to the opposite end of linkage group G from C006V (rhg1), one near the marker B032V-1 on linkage group J and a third linked to A280Hae-1 on linkage group N. Comparisons between the different SCN races indicated that some of the putative SCN QTLs behave in a race specific manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> PI437654 was identified as having resistance to all known races. Based on analysis of 328 recombinant inbreed lines (RIL) derived from a cross between PI437654 and BSR101, Webb reported six QTLs associated with SCN resistance on linkage groups A2, C1, G, M, L25 and L26 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,081). An allele on linkage group G, presumed to be rhg1, is involved with certain SCN races tested (races 1, 2, 3, 5 and 14), and has the largest reported phenotypic effect on resistance to every race. In contrast, the QTLs on linkage groups A2, C1, M, L25 and L26 act in a race specific manner. The QTL on linkage group L25 was reportedly involved with four of the five races, while the QTLs on linkage groups, A2, C1 and L26 were each involved in resistance to two of the five races (U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,081). Webb further reports data that the resistance to any of the five races is likely to result from the combined effects of the QTL involved in each race (U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,081). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Qui et al. (<highlight><italic>Theor Appl Genet </italic></highlight>98:356-364 (1999)) screened 200 F<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>:<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>families derived from a cross between Peking and Essex and identified RFLP markers which are associated with SCN resistance QTLs on linkage groups B, E, I and H. The three QTLs on linkage groups B, E and H jointly account for 57.7% of the phenotypic variation to race 1, the QTLs on linkage groups H and B account for 21.4% of the variation to race 3, while the QTLs on linkage groups I and E are associated with resistance to race 5 accounting for 14.0% of the phenotypic variation. In contrast to previous mapping studies which use Peking as the source of resistance, no significant association was detected to the rhg1 locus on linkage group G. The authors point out that the marker Bng122, which has been shown to have significant linkage to rhg1, is not polymorphic in the population employed (Concibido et al., <highlight><italic>Crop Sci. </italic></highlight>36:1643-1650 (1996)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It has been reported that the rhg1 locus on linkage group G is necessary for the development of resistance to any of the SCN races. There have been efforts to develop molecular markers to identify breeding lines harboring the rhg1 SCN resistant allele. One of the most commonly used markers for marker assisted selection (MAS) of rhg1 is an SSR locus that co-segregates and maps roughly 0.4 cM from rhg1. This SRR marker, BARC-Satt<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>309 is able to distinguish most, if not all, of the SCN sensitive genotypes from those harboring rhg1 from important sources of resistance such as Peking and PI437654. Two simple sequence repeat markers have been reported that can be used to select for SCN resistance at the rhg1 locus (Concibido et al., <highlight><italic>Theor Appl Genet </italic></highlight>99: 811-818 (1999)). Satt<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>309 was also effective in distinguishing SCN resistant sources PI88788 and PI209332 in many, but not all, sensitive genotypes. In particular, Satt<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight>309 can not be used for MAS in populations developed from &ldquo;typical&rdquo; southern US cultivars (e.g., Lee, Bragg and Essex) crossed with resistance sources PI88788 or PI209332. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Matson and Williams have reported a dominant SCN resistance locus, Rhg4, which is tightly linked to the &lsquo;i&rsquo; locus on linkage group A2 (Matson and Williams, <highlight><italic>Crop Sci. </italic></highlight>5:447 (1965)). The QTL reported by Webb on linkage group A2 maps near the &lsquo;i&rsquo; locus and is considered to be Rhg4 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,081). Webb concludes that only two loci on linkage groups A2 (Rhg4) and G (rhg1) explain the genetic variation to race 3. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> A) rhg1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a method for the production of a soybean plant having an rhg1 SCN resistant allele comprising: (A) crossing a first soybean plant having an rhg1 SCN rersistant allele with a second soybean plant having an rhg1 SCN sensitive allele to produce a segregating population; (B) screening the segregating population for a member having an rhglI SCN resistant allele with a first nucleic acid molecule capable of specifically hybridizing to linkage group G, wherein the first nucleic acid molecule specifically hybridizes to a second nucleic acid molecule that is linked to the rhg1 SCN resistant allele; and, (C) selecting the member for further crossing and selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> rhg1 is located on linkage group G (Concibido et al., <highlight><italic>Crop Sci. </italic></highlight>36:1643-1650 (1996)). SCN resistant alleles of rhg1 provide partial resistance to SCN races 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 14 (Conciobido et al. (<highlight><italic>Crop Sci. </italic></highlight>37:258-264 (1997)). Also, Webb (U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,081) reports that a QTL on linkage group G (rhg1) provides partial resistance to SCN races 1, 2, 3, 5, and 14. rhg1 and Rhg4 provide complete or nearly complete resistance to SCN race 3 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,081). While initially thought to be a recessive gene, rhg1 classification as a recessive gene has been questioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Using bioinformatic approaches, the rhg1 coding region is predicted to contain either four exons (rhg1, v.1)(coding coordinates 45163-45314, 45450-45509, 46941-48763, and 48975-49573 of SEQ ID NO: 2) or two exons (rhg1, v.2) (coding coordinates 46798-48763 and 48975-49573 of SEQ ID NO: 3). rhg1, v.1 encodes an 877 amino acid polypeptide. rhg1, v.2 encodes an 854 amino acid length polypeptide. rhg1 codes for a Xa21-like receptor kinase (SEQ ID NOs: 1097, 1098, and 1100-1115) (Song, et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>270, 1804-1806 (1995)). rhg1 has an extracellular leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain (rhg1, v.1, SEQ ID NO: 1097, residues 164-457; rhg1, v.2, SEQ ID NO: 1098, residues 141-434), a transmembrane domain (rhg1, v.1, SEQ ID NO: 1097, residues 508-530; rhg1, v.2, SEQ ID NO: 1098, residues 33-51, and 485-507) and serine/threonine protein kinase (STK) domain (rhg1, v.1, SEQ ID NO: 1097, residues 578-869; rhg1, v.2, SEQ ID NO: 1098, residues 555-846). In a preferred embodiment, the LRR domain has multiple LRR repeats. In a more preferred embodiment, the LRR domain has 12 LRR H repeats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> To identify proteins similar to the proteins encoded by rhg1 candidates, database searches are performed using the predicted peptide sequences. The rhg1 candidate shows similarity to CAA18124, which is the Arabidopsis putative receptor kinase (58.4% similarity and 35.8% identity, (CLUSTALW (default parameters), Thompson et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 22:4673-4680 (1994)), GCG package, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, Wis.), and the apple leucine-rich receptor-like protein kinase (g3641252) (53.2% similarity and 31.5% identity, (CLUSTALW (default parameters))), which has both LLR and STK domains, showing conservation in both the LLR and STK domains. The predicted LRR extracellular domain shows similarity to the tomato resistance genes Cf-2.1 (<highlight><italic>Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium</italic></highlight>) (66.9% similarity and 45.4% identity (CLUSTALW (default parameters))) and Cf-2.2 (<highlight><italic>Lycopersicon pimpinellifolium</italic></highlight>) (66.9% similarity and 45.4% identity (CLUSTALW (default parameters))). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is an alignment of the LRR domain of the rhg1 gene. A consensus sequence for the LRR is shown as the top row of the alignment. Each row of amino acids represents an LRR domain. The boxed region indicates the putative &bgr;-turn/&bgr;-sheet structural motif postulated to be involved in ligand binding (Jones and Jones, <highlight><italic>Adv. Bot. Res. Incorp. Adv. Plant Path. </italic></highlight>24;89-167 (1997)). The hydrophobic leucine residues are thought to project into the core of the protein while the flanking amino acids are thought to be solvent exposed where they may interact with the ligand (Kobe and Deisenhofer, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>374; 183-186 (1995)). Non-conservative changes in this region are thought to affect folding. An &ldquo;x&rdquo; represents an arbitrary amino acid while an &ldquo;a&rdquo; represents a hydrophobic residue (leucine, isoleucine, methionine, valine, or phenylalanine). Amino acid substitutions between resistant and sensitive phenotypes are bordered by a double line. The amino acid substitution within the 302-325 region is a histidine/asparagine substitution, and the amino acid substitution within the 422-445 region is a phenylalanine/serine substitution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a naturally occurring rhg1 allele is any allele that encodes for a protein U having an extracellular LRR, a transmembrane domain, and STK domain where the naturally occurring allele is present on linkage group G and where certain rhg1 alleles, but not all rhg1 alleles, are capable of providing or contributing to resistance or partial resistance to a race of SCN. It is understood that such an allele can, using for example methods disclosed herein, be manipulated so that the nucleic acid molecule encoding the protein is no longer present on linkage group G. It is also understood that such an allele can, using for example methods disclosed herein, be manipulated so that the nucleic acid molecule sequence is altered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> As used herein, an rhg1 SCN resistant allele is any rhg1 allele where that allele alone or in combination with other SCN resistant alleles present in the plant, such as an Rhg4 SCN resistant allele, provides resistance to a race of SCN, and that resistance is due, at least in part, to the genetic contribution of the rhg1 allele. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> SCN resistance or partial resistance is determined by a comparison of the plant in question with a known SCN sensitive host, Lee 74, according to the method set forth in Schmitt, <highlight><italic>J. Nematol. </italic></highlight>20:392-395 (1988). As used herein, resistance to a particular race of SCN is defined as having less than 10% of cyst development relative to the SCN sensitive host Lee 74. Moreover, as used herein, partial resistance to a particular race of SCN is defined as having more than 10% but less than 75% of cyst development relative to the SCN sensitive host Lee 74. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Any soybean plant having an rhg1 SCN resistant allele can be used in conjunction with the present invention. Soybeans with known rhg1 SCN resistant alleles can be used. Such soybeans include but are not limited to PI548402 (Peking), PI200499, A2869, Jack, A2069, PI209332 (No:4), PI404166 (Krasnoaarmejkaja), PI404198 (Sun huan do), PI437654 (Er-hej-jan), PI438489 (Chiquita), PI507354 (Tokei 421), PI548655 (Forrest), PI548988 (Pickett), PI84751, PI437654, PI40792, Pyramid, Nathan, AG2201, A3469, AG3901, A3904, AG4301, AG4401, AG4501, AG4601, PION9492, PI88788, Dyer, Custer, Manokin, and Doles. In a preferred aspect, the soybean plant having an rhg1 SCN resistant allele is an rhg1 haplotype 2 allele. Examples of soybeans with an rhg1 haplotype 2 allele are PI548402 (Peking), PI404166 (Krasnoaarmejkaja), PI404198 (Sun huan do), PI437654 (Er-hejjan), PI438489 (Chiquita), 1H PI507354 (Tokei 421), PI548655 (Forrest), PI548988 (Pickett), PI84751, PI437654, and PI40792. In addition, using the methods or agents of the present invention, soybeans and wild relative of soybean such as <highlight><italic>Glycine soja </italic></highlight>can be screened for the presence of rhg1 SCN resistant alleles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Any soybean plant having an rhg1 SCN sensitive allele can be used in conjunction with the present invention. Such soybeans include A3244, A2833, AG3001, Williams, Will, A2704, Noir, DK23-51, Lee 74, Essex, Minsoy, A1923, and Hutcheson. In a preferred aspect, the soybean plant having an rhg1 SCN sensitive allele is an rhg1 A3244 allele. In addition, using the methods or agents of the present invention, soybeans and wild relatives of soybean such as <highlight><italic>Glycine soja </italic></highlight>can be screened for the presence of rhg1 SCN sensitive alleles. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In Table 2, discrete haplotypes are designated 1 through 8. N/A refers to a haplotype that is not characterized. The Plant Introduction classification number is indicated in the &ldquo;PI&num;&rdquo; column. A dash indicates that no PI number is known or assigned for the line under investigation. The line from which the sequences are derived is indicated in the &ldquo;line&rdquo; column, with a dash indicating an unknown or unnamed line. The &ldquo;Ph.&rdquo; (phenotype) column of table 2 indicates whether a given line has been reported as resistant (R) to at least one race of SCN or sensitive (S). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The nucleotide bases located at each of 30 positions in each of the haplotype sequences is shown in the columns labeled &ldquo;Base number of contig 240O17_region_G3 of reference line A3244.&rdquo; The base number at the top of each column corresponds to the base number in contig 240O17_region_G3 of reference line A3224 (SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 3). The letters G, A, C, and T correspond to the bases guanine, adenine, cytosine, and thymine. Two bases separated by a slash (A/G, C/T, or T/C) indicate uncertainty at the specified position of the haplotype sequence. A &ldquo;d&rdquo; followed by a number indicates a deletion of a the length specified. That is, dl is a one base deletion, d2 is a two base deletion, d14 is a fourteen base deletion, and d19 is a nineteen base deletion. A zero (0) indicates no deletion. A dash indicates that the identity of the base is undetermined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Examination of table 2 reveals that the amino acid substitutions in the rhg1 coding region are common to the resistant lines PI467312 (Cha-mo-shi-dou), PI88788 and the southern susceptible lines Essex, Hutchenson, Noir and A1923. As used herein, a &ldquo;southern&rdquo; cultivar is any cultivar from maturity groups VI, VII, VIII, IX, or X, and a &ldquo;northern&rdquo; cultivar is any cultivar from maturity groups 000, 00, 0, I, II, III, IV, or V. This data is consistent with the mapping experiments of Qui et al. (<highlight><italic>Theor Appl Genet </italic></highlight>98:356-364 (1999)). Based on analysis of 200 F<highlight><subscript>2:3 </subscript></highlight>families derived from a cross between Peking and Essex, the authors failed to detect any significant association with SCN resistance to races 1, 2, and 3, and the rhg1 locus on linkage group G. The authors point out that one of the markers, Bng122, which has been shown to have significant linkage to rhg1 (Concibido et al., <highlight><italic>Crop Sci. </italic></highlight>36:1643-1650 (1996)), is not polymorphic in the population employed. It is also possible that the susceptible southern lines contain rhg1 and the susceptible phenotype reflects the polygenic nature of SCN resistance. In a study to uncover QTLs for sudden death syndrome (SDS) in soybean, two SCN resistant alleles originating from the susceptible parent Essex have been described (Hlnetkovsky et al., <highlight><italic>Crop Sci. </italic></highlight>36:393-400). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> B) Rhg4 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a method for the production of a soybean plant having an Rhg4 SCN resistant allele comprising: (A) crossing a first soybean plant having an Rhg4 SCN resistant allele with a second soybean plant having an Rhg4 SCN sensitive allele to produce a segregating population; (B) screening the segregating population for a member having an Rhg4 SCN resistant allele with a first nucleic acid molecule capable of specifically hybridizing to linkage group A2, wherein the first nucleic acid molecule specifically hybridizes to a second nucleic acid molecule linked to the Rhg4 SCN resistant allele; and, (C) selecting the member for further crossing and selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Rhg4 is located on linkage group A2 (Matson and Williams, <highlight><italic>Crop Sci. </italic></highlight>5:447 (1965)). SCN resistant alleles of Rhg4 provide partial resistance to SCN races 1 and 3 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,491,081). Together, rhg1 and Rhg4 provide complete or nearly complete resistance to SCN race 3. The dominant gene, Rhg4, was found to be closely linked to the seed coat color locus (i) (Matson and Williams, <highlight><italic>Crop Sci. </italic></highlight>5:447 (1965)). The i locus in Peking was also reported to be linked with a recessive gene for resistance to SCN (Sugiyama and Katsumi, <highlight><italic>Jpn. J. Breed. </italic></highlight>16:83-86 (1966)). It is possible that Rhg4 and the recessive gene linked to the i locus are one and the same, which would call into question the classification of Rhg4 as a dominant gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Using bioinformatic approaches the Rhg4 coding region is predicted to contain 2 exons (coding coordinates 111805-113968 and 114684-115204 of SEQ ID NO: 4). Rhg4 encodes an 894 amino acid polypeptide. Rhg4 codes for a Xa21-like receptor kinase (SEQ ID NOs: 1099 and 1116-1119) (Song et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>270, 1804-1806, (1995)). Rhg4 has an extracellular LRR domain (Rhg4, SEQ ID NO: 1099, residues 34-44), a transmembrane domain (Rhg4 SEQ ID NO: 1099, residues 449-471), and STK domain (Rhg4, SEQ ID NO: 1099, residues 531-830). In a preferred embodiment, the LRR domain has multiple LRR repeats. In a more preferred embodiment, the LRR domain has 12 LRR repeats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> To identify proteins similar to the Rhg4 candidate, database searches are performed using the predicted peptide sequences. The Rhg4 candidate shows similarity to TMK (Y07748)(73.0% similarity and 54.8% identity (CLUSTALW (default parameters))) and TMK1 PRECURSOR (70.6% similarity and 55.1% identity (CLUSTALW (default parameters))), which are rice and Arabidopsis receptor kinases, respectively. The predicted LRR extracellular domain reveals similarity to TMK (Y07748)(70.1% similarity and 46.6% identity (CLUSTALW (default parameters))), TMK1 PRECURSOR (g1707642) (65.8% similarity and 48.8% identity (CLUSTALW (default parameters))), and F21J9.1 (g2213607) (65.5% similarity and 45.6% identity (CLUSTALW (default parameters))). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is an alignment of the LRR domain of the Rhg4 gene. A consensus sequence is shown as the top row. Each row of amino acids represents an LRR domain. The boxed region indicates the putative &bgr;-turn/&bgr;-sheet structural motif postulated to be involved in ligand binding (Jones and Jones, <highlight><italic>Adv. Bot. Res. Incorp. Adv. Plant Path. </italic></highlight>24;89-167 (1997)). The hydrophobic leucine residues are thought to project into the core of the protein while the flanking amino acids are thought to be solvent exposed where they may interact with the ligand (Kobe and Deisenhofer, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>374; 183-186 (1995)). An &ldquo;x&rdquo; represents an arbitrary amino acid while an &ldquo;a&rdquo; represents a hydrophobic residue (leucine, isoleucine, methionine, valine, or phenylalanine). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Amino acid substitutions between resistant and sensitive phenotypes are bordered by a double line. The amino acid substitution within the 35-57 region is a histidine/glutamine substitution, and the amino acid substitution within the 81-104 region is a leucine/phenylalanine substitution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a naturally-occurring Rhg4 allele is any allele that encodes for a protein having an extracellular LRR domain, a transmembrane domain, and STK domain where the naturally occurring allele is present on linkage group A2 and where certain Rgh4 alleles, but not all Rgh4 alleles, are capable of providing or contributing to resistance or partial resistance to a race of SCN. It is understood that such an allele can, using, for example methods disclosed herein, be manipulated so that the nucleic acid molecule encoding the protein is no longer present on linkage group A2. It is also understood that such an allele can, using, for example methods disclosed herein, be manipulated so that the nucleic acid molecule sequence is altered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> As used herein, an Rhg4 SCN resistant allele is any Rhg4 allele where that allele alone or in combination with other SCN resistant alleles present in the plant, such as an rhg1 SCN resistant allele, provides resistance to a race of SCN, and that resistance is due, at least in part, to the genetic contribution of the Rhg4 allele. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Any soybean plant having an Rhg4 SCN resistant allele can be used in conjunction with the present invention. Soybeans with known Rhg4 SCN resistant alleles can be used. Such soybeans include, but are not limited to, PI548402 (Peking), PI437654 (Er-hej-jan), PI438489 (Chiquita), PI507354 (Tokei 421), PI548655 (Forrest), PI548988 (Pickett), PI88788, PI404198 (Sun Huan Do), PI404166 (Krasnoaarmejkaja), Hartwig, Manokin, Doles, Dyer, and Custer. In a preferred aspect, the soybean plant having an Rhg4 SCN resistant allele is an Rhg4 haplotype 3 allele in a plant having either an rhg1 haplotype 2 or rhg1 haplotype 4 allele. Examples of soybeans with an Rhg4 haplotype 3 allele are PI548402 (Peking), PI88788, PI404198 (Sun huan do), PI438489 (Chiquita), PI437654 (Er-hej-jan), PI404166 (Krasnoaarmejkaja), PI548655 (Forrest), PI548988 (Pickett), and PI507354 (Tokei 421). In addition, using the methods or agents of the present invention, soybeans and wild relatives of soybeans such as <highlight><italic>Glycine soja </italic></highlight>can be screened for the presence of Rhg4 SCN resistant alleles. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In Table 5, haplotypes, as used in Tables 2 through 4, are listed for each line. N/A refers to a haplotype that is not characterized. The Plant Introduction classification number is indicated in the &ldquo;PI&num;&rdquo; column. A dash indicates that no PI number is known or assigned for the line under investigation. The line from which the sequences are derived is indicated in the &ldquo;line&rdquo; column, with a dash indicating an unknown or unnamed line. The &ldquo;Ph.&rdquo; column of table 5 indicates whether a given line has been reported to be resistant (R) to at least one race of SCN, or sensitive (S).

At the I locus, black seeded varieties harbor the i allele for black or imperfect black seed coat. In a preferred embodiment, the seed has a yellow coat. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Any appropriate method can be used to screen for a plant having an rhg1 SCN resistant allele. Any appropriate method can be used to screen for a plant having an Rhg4 SCN resistant allele. In a preferred aspect of the present invention, a nucleic acid marker of the present invention can be used (see section entitled &ldquo;Screening for rhg1 and Rhg4 alleles&rdquo; and subsection (ii) of the section entitled &ldquo;Agents&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> Additional markers, such as SSRs, AFLP markers, RFLP markers, RAPD markers, phenotypic markers, SNPs, isozyme markers, microarray transcription profiles that are genetically linked to or correlated with alleles of a QTL of the present invention can be utilized (Walton, <highlight><italic>Seed World </italic></highlight>22-29 (July, 1993); Burow and Blake, <highlight><italic>Molecular Dissection of Complex Traits, </italic></highlight>13-29, Eds. Paterson, CRC Press, New York (1988)). Methods to isolate such markers are known in the art. For example, locus-specific SSRs can be obtained by screening a genomic library for SSRs, sequencing of &ldquo;positive&rdquo; clones, designing primers which flank the repeats, and amplifying genomic DNA with these primers. The size of the resulting amplification products can vary by integral numbers of the basic repeat unit. To detect a polymorphism, PCR products can be radiolabeled, separated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and detected by autoradiography. Fragments with size differences &gt;4 bp can also be resolved on agarose gels, thus avoiding radioactivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Other SSR markers may be utilized. Amplification of simple tandem repeats, mainly of the &lsqb;CA&rsqb;n type were reported by Litt and Luty, <highlight><italic>Amer. J. Human Genet. </italic></highlight>44:397-401 (1989); Smeets et al., <highlight><italic>Human Genet. </italic></highlight>83:245-251 (1989); Tautz, <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>17:6463-6472 (1989); Weber and May, <highlight><italic>Am. J. Hum. Genet. </italic></highlight>44:388-396 (1989). Weber, <highlight><italic>Genomics </italic></highlight>7:524-530 (1990), reported that the level of polymorphism detected by PCR-amplified &lsqb;CA&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>type SSRs depends on the number of the &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; (i.e., uninterrupted), tandemly repeated motifs. Below a certain threshold (i.e., 12 CA-repeats), the SSRs were reported to be primarily monomorphic. Above this threshold, however, the probability of polymorphism increases with SSR length. Consequently, long, perfect arrays of SSRs are preferred for the generation of markers, i.e., for the design and synthesis of flanking primers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> Suitable primers can be deduced from DNA databases (e.g., Akkaya et al., <highlight><italic>Genetics. </italic></highlight>132:1131-1139 (1992)). Alternatively, size-selected genomic libraries (200 to 500 bp) can be constructed by, for example, using the following steps: (1) isolation of genomic DNA; (2) digestion with one or more 4 base-specific restriction enzymes; (3) size-selection of restriction fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis, excision and purification of the desire size fraction; (4) ligation of the DNA into a suitable vector and transformation into a suitable <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain; (5) screening for the presence of SSRs by colony or plaque hybridization with a labeled probe; (6) isolation of positive clones and sequencing of the inserts; and (7) design of suitable primers flanking the SSR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Establishing libraries with small, size-selected inserts can be advantageous for SSR isolation for two reasons: (1) long SSRs are often unstable in <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>, and (2) positive clones can be sequenced without subcloning. A number of approaches have been reported for the enrichment of SSRs in genomic libraries. Such enrichment procedures are particularly useful if libraries are screened with comparatively rare tri- and tetranucleotide repeat motifs. One such approach has been described by Ostrander et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A</italic></highlight>). 89:3419-3423 (1992), who reported the generation of a small-insert phagemid library in an <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain deficient in UTPase (d8t) and uracil-N-glycosylase (ung) genes. In the absence of UTPase and uracil-N-glycosylase, dUTP can compete with dTTP for the incorporation into DNA. Single-stranded phagemid DNA isolated from such a library can be primed with &lsqb;CA&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>and &lsqb;TG&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>primers for second strand synthesis, and the products used to transform a wild-type <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain. Since under these conditions there will be selection against single-stranded, uracil-containing DNA molecules, the resulting library will consist of primer-extended, double-stranded products and an about 50-fold enrichment in CA-repeats. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Other reported enrichment strategies rely on hybridization selection of simple sequence repeats prior to cloning (Karagyozov et al., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>21:3911-3912 (1993); Armour et al., <highlight><italic>Hum. Mol. Gen. </italic></highlight>3:599-605 (1994); Kijas et al., <highlight><italic>Genome </italic></highlight>38:349-355 (1994); Kandpal et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 91:88-92 (1994); Edwards et al., <highlight><italic>Am. J. Hum. Genet. </italic></highlight>49:746-756 (1991)). Hybridization selection, can for example, involve the following steps: (1) genomic DNA is fragmented, either by sonication, or by digestion with a restriction enzyme; (2) genomic DNA fragments are ligated to adapters that allow a &ldquo;whole genome PCR&rdquo; at this or a later stage of the procedure; (3) genomic DNA fragments are amplified, denatured and hybridized with single-stranded SSR sequences bound to a nylon membrane; (4) after washing off unbound DNA, hybridizing fragments enriched for SSRs are eluted from the membrane by boiling or alkali treatment, reamplified using adapter-complementary primers, and digested with a restriction enzyme to remove the adapters; and (5) DNA fragments are ligated into a suitable 15 vector and transformed into a suitable <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain. SSRs can be found in up to 50-70% of the clones obtained from these procedures (Armour et al., <highlight><italic>Hum. Mol. Gen. </italic></highlight>3:599-605 (1994); Edwards et al., <highlight><italic>Am. J. Hum. Genet. </italic></highlight>49:746-756 (1991)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> An alternative hybridization selection strategy was reported by Kijas et al., <highlight><italic>Genome </italic></highlight>38:599-605 (1994), which replaced the nylon membrane with biotinylated, SSR-complementary oligonucleotides attached to streptavidin-coated magnetic particles. SSR-containing DNA fragments are selectively bound to the magnetic beads, reamplified, restriction-digested and cloned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> It is further understood that other additional markers on linkage group G or A2 may be utilized (Morgante et al., <highlight><italic>Genome </italic></highlight>37:763-769 (1994)). As used herein, reference to the linkage group of G or A2 refers to the linkage group that corresponds to linkage groups U5 and U3, respectively from the genetic map of <highlight><italic>Glycine max </italic></highlight>(Mansur et al., <highlight><italic>Crop Sci. </italic></highlight>36: 1327-1336 (1996), and linkage groups G and A2, respectively, of <highlight><italic>Glycine max </italic></highlight>x. <highlight><italic>Glycine soja </italic></highlight>(Shoemaker et al., <highlight><italic>Genetics </italic></highlight>144: 329-336 (1996)) that is present in <highlight><italic>Glycine soja </italic></highlight>(Soybase, an Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture (http://129.186.26.940/ and USDA&mdash;Agricultural Research Service: http://www.ars.usda.gov/)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> PCR-amplified SSRs can be used, because they are locus-specific, codominant, occur in large numbers and allow the unambiguous identification of alleles. Standard PCR-amplified SSR protocols use radioisotopes and denaturing polyacrylamide gels to detect amplified SSRs. In many situations, however, allele sizes are sufficiently different to be resolved on high percentage agarose gels in combination with ethidium bromide staining (Bell and Ecker, <highlight><italic>Genomics </italic></highlight>19:137-144 (1994); Becker and Heun, <highlight><italic>Genome </italic></highlight>38:991-998 (1995); Huttel, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Frankfurt, Germany (1996)). High resolution without applying radioactivity is also provided by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in combination with either ethidium bromide (Scrimshaw, <highlight><italic>Biotechniques </italic></highlight>13:2189 (1992)) or silver straining (Klinkicht and Tautz, <highlight><italic>Molecular Ecology </italic></highlight>1: 133-134 (1992); Neilan et al., <highlight><italic>Biotechniques </italic></highlight>17:708-712 (1994)). An alternative of PCR-amplified SSRs typing involves the use of fluorescent primers in combination with a semi-automated DNA sequencer (Schwengel et al., <highlight><italic>Genomics </italic></highlight>22:46-54 (1994)). Fluorescent PCR products can be detected by real-time laser scanning during gel electrophoresis. An advantage of this technology is that different amplification reactions as well as a size marker (each labeled with a different fluorophore) can be combined into one lane during electrophoresis. Multiplex analysis of up to 24 different SSR loci per lane has been reported (Schwengel et al., <highlight><italic>Genomics </italic></highlight>22:46-54 (1994)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The detection of polymorphic sites in a sample of DNA may be facilitated through the use of nucleic acid amplification methods. Such methods specifically increase the concentration of polynucleotides that span the polymorphic site, or include that site and sequences located either distal or proximal to it. Such amplified molecules can be readily detected by gel electrophoresis or other means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The most preferred method of achieving such amplification employs the polymerase chain reaction (&ldquo;PCR&rdquo;) (Mullis et al., <highlight><italic>Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. </italic></highlight>51:263-273 (1986); Erlich et al., European Patent Appln. 50,424; European Patent Appln. 84,796, European Patent Application 258,017, European Patent Appln. 237,362; Mullis, European Patent Appln. 201,184; Mullis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,202; Erlich, U.S. Pat. No. 4,582,788; and Saiki et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,194), using primer pairs that are capable of hybridizing to the proximal sequences that define a polymorphism in its double-stranded form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In lieu of PCR, alternative methods, such as the &ldquo;Ligase Chain Reaction&rdquo; (&ldquo;LCR&rdquo;) may be used (Barany, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 88:189-193 (1991)). LCR uses two pairs of oligonucleotide probes to exponentially amplify a specific target. The sequences of each pair of oligonucleotides is selected to permit the pair to hybridize to abutting sequences of the same strand of the target. Such hybridization forms a substrate for a template-dependent ligase. As with PCR, the resulting products thus serve as a template in subsequent cycles and an exponential amplification of the desired sequence is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> LCR can be performed with oligonucleotides having the proximal and distal sequences of the same strand of a polymorphic site. In one embodiment, either oligonucleotide will be HE designed to include the actual polymorphic site of the polymorphism. In such an embodiment, the reaction conditions are selected such that the oligonucleotides can be ligated together only if the target molecule either contains or lacks the specific nucleotide that is complementary to the polymorphic site present on the oligonucleotide. Alternatively, the oligonucleotides may be selected such that they do not include the polymorphic site (see, Segev, PCT Application WO 90/01069). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;Oligonucleotide Ligation Assay&rdquo; (&ldquo;OLA&rdquo;) may alternatively be employed (Landegren et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>241:1077-1080 (1988)). The OLA protocol uses two oligonucleotides that are designed to be capable of hybridizing to abutting sequences of a single strand of a target. OLA, like LCR, is particularly suited for the detection of point mutations. Unlike LCR, however, OLA results in &ldquo;linear&rdquo; rather than exponential amplification of the target sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Nickerson et al. have described a nucleic acid detection assay that combines attributes of PCR and OLA (Nickerson et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 87:8923-8927 (1990)). In this method, PCR is used to achieve the exponential amplification of target DNA, which is then detected using OLA. In addition to requiring multiple, and separate, processing steps, one problem associated with such combinations is that they inherit all of the problems associated with PCR and OLA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Schemes based on ligation of two (or more) oligonucleotides in the presence of a nucleic acid having the sequence of the resulting &ldquo;di-oligonucleotide,&rdquo; thereby amplifying the di-oligonucleotide, are also known (Wu et al., <highlight><italic>Genomics </italic></highlight>4:560-569 (1989)), and may be readily adapted to the purposes of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> Other known nucleic acid amplification procedures, such as allele-specific oligomers, branched DNA technology, transcription-based amplification systems, or isothermal amplification methods may also be used to amplify and analyze such polymorphisms (Malek et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,130,238; Davey et al., European Patent Application 329,822; Schuster et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,169,766; Miller et al., PCT Patent Application WO 89/06700; Kwoh, et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(U.S.A.) 86:1173-1177 (1989); Gingeras et al., PCT Patent Application WO 1-d 88/10315; Walker et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 89:392-396 (1992)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Polymorphisms can also be identified by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. SSCP is a method capable of identifying most sequence variations in a single strand of DNA, typically between 150 and 250 nucleotides in length (Elles, <highlight><italic>Methods in Molecular Medicine: Molecular Diagnosis of Genetic Diseases, </italic></highlight>Humana Press (1996); Orita et al., <highlight><italic>Genomics </italic></highlight>5: 874-879 (1989)). Under denaturing conditions a single strand of DNA will adopt a conformation that is uniquely dependent on its sequence conformation. This conformation usually will be different, even if only a single base is changed. Most conformations have been reported to alter the physical configuration or size sufficiently to be detectable by electrophoresis. A number of protocols have been described for SSCP including, but not limited to, Lee et al., <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>205: 289-293 (1992); Suzuki et al., <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>192: 82-84 (1991); Lo et al., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Research </italic></highlight>20: 1005-1009 (1992); Sarkar et al., <highlight><italic>Genomics </italic></highlight>13:441-443 (1992). It is understood that one or more of the nucleic acids of the present invention can be utilized as markers or probes to detect polymorphisms by SSCP analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Polymorphisms may also be found using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) (Williams et al., <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acids Res. </italic></highlight>18: 6531-6535 (1990)) and cleaveable amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS) (Lyamichev et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>260: 778-783 (1993)). It is understood that one or more of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can be utilized as markers or probes to detect polymorphisms by RAPD or CAPS analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> The identification of a polymorphism can be determined in a variety of ways. By correlating the presence or absence of it in a plant with the presence or absence of a phenotype, it is possible to predict the phenotype of that plant. If a polymorphism creates or destroys a restriction endonuclease cleavage site, or if it results in the loss or insertion of DNA (e.g., a variable nucleotide tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism), it will alter the size or profile of the DNA fragments that are generated by digestion with that restriction endonuclease. As such, individuals that possess a variant sequence can be distinguished from those having the original sequence by restriction fragment analysis. Polymorphisms that can be identified in this manner are termed &ldquo;restriction fragment length polymorphisms&rdquo; (&ldquo;RFLPs&rdquo;). RFLPs have been widely used in human and plant genetic analyses (Glassberg, UK Patent Application 2135774; Skolnick et al., <highlight><italic>Cytogen. Cell Genet. </italic></highlight>32:58-67 (1982); Botstein et al., <highlight><italic>Ann. J. Hum. Genet. </italic></highlight>32:314-331 (1980); Fischer et al. (PCT Application WO90/13668); Uhlen, PCT Application WO90/11369)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> A central attribute of &ldquo;single nucleotide polymorphisms,&rdquo; or &ldquo;SNPs&rdquo; is that the site of the polymorphism is at a single nucleotide. SNPs have certain reported advantages over RFLPs and VNTRs. First, SNPs are more stable than other classes of polymorphisms. Their spontaneous mutation rate is approximately 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;9 </superscript></highlight>(Komberg, DNA Replication, W.H. Freeman &amp; Co., San Francisco, 1980), approximately 1,000 times less frequent than VNTRs (U.S. Pat. No. 5,679,524). Second, SNPs occur at greater frequency, and with greater uniformity than RFLPs and VNTRs. As SNPs result from sequence variation, new polymorphisms can be identified by sequencing random genomic or cDNA molecules. SNPs can also result from deletions, point mutations and insertions. Any single base alteration, whatever the cause, can be an SNP. The greater frequency of SNPs means that they can be more readily identified than the other classes of polymorphisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> SNPs and insertion/deletions can be detected by methods, by any of a variety of methods including those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,210,015; 5,876,930 and 6,030,787 in which an oligonucleotide probe having reporter and quencher molecules is hybridized to a target polynucleotide. The probe is degraded by 5&prime;&rarr;3&prime; exonuclease activity of a nucleic acid polymerase. A useful assay is available from AB Biosystems (850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, Calif.) as the Taqman&reg; assay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Specific nucleotide variations such as SNPs and insertion/deletions can also be detected by labeled base extension methods as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,004,744; 6,013,431; 5,595,890; 5,762,876; and 5,945,283. These methods are based on primer extension and incorporation of detectable nucleoside triphosphates. The primer is designed to anneal to the sequence immediately adjacent to the variable nucleotide which can be can be detected after incorporation of as few as one labeled nucleoside triphosphate. U.S. Pat. No. 5,468,613 discloses allele specific oligonucleotide hybridizations where single or multiple nucleotide variations in nucleic acid sequence can be detected in nucleic acids by a process in which the sequence containing the nucleotide variation is amplified, spotted on a membrane and treated with a labeled sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Such methods also include the direct or indirect sequencing of the site, the use of restriction enzymes where the respective alleles of the site create or destroy a restriction site, the use of allele-specific hybridization probes, the use of antibodies that are specific for the proteins encoded by the different alleles of the polymorphism or by other biochemical interpretation. SNPs can be sequenced by a number of methods. Two basic methods may be used for DNA sequencing, the chain termination method of Sanger et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 74: 5463-5467 (1977), and the chemical degradation method of Maxam and Gilbert, <highlight><italic>Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 74: 560-564 (1977). Automation and advances in technology such as the replacement of radioisotopes with fluorescence-based sequencing have reduced the effort required to sequence DNA (Craxton, Methods, 2: 20-26 (1991); Ju et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 92: 4347-4351 (1995); Tabor and Richardson, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 92: 6339-6343 (1995)). Automated sequencers are available from, for example, Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Piscataway, N.J. (Pharmacia ALF), LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, Nebr. (LI-COR 4,000) and Millipore, Bedford, Mass. (Millipore BaseStation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> In addition, advances in capillary gel electrophoresis have also reduced the effort required to sequence DNA and such advances provide a rapid high resolution approach for sequencing DNA samples (Swerdlow and Gesteland, <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>18:1415-1419 (1990); Smith, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>349:812-813 (1991); Luckey et al., <highlight><italic>Methods Enzymol. </italic></highlight>218:154-172 (1993); Lu et al., <highlight><italic>J.

Theor. Electrophor. </italic></highlight>5:1-5 (1995)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> The genetic linkage of marker molecules can be established by a gene mapping model such as, without limitation, the flanking marker model reported by Lander and Botstein, <highlight><italic>Genetics, </italic></highlight>121:185-199 (1989), and the interval mapping, based on maximum likelihood methods described by Lander and Botstein, <highlight><italic>Genetics, </italic></highlight>121:185-199 (1989), and implemented in the software package MAPMAKER/QTL (Lincoln and Lander, <highlight><italic>Mapping Genes Controlling Quantitative Traits Using MAPMAKER/QTL, </italic></highlight>Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Massachusetts, (1990). Additional software includes Qgene, Version 2.23 (1996), Department of Plant Breeding and Biometry, 266 Emerson Hall, Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y.). Use of Qgene software is a particularly preferred approach. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> A maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for the presence of a marker is calculated, together with an MLE assuming no QTL effect, to avoid false positives. A log<highlight><subscript>10 </subscript></highlight>of an odds ratio (LOD) is then calculated as: LOD&equals;log<highlight><subscript>10 </subscript></highlight>(MLE for the presence of a QTL(MLE given no linked QTL). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> The LOD score essentially indicates how much more likely the data are to have arisen assuming the presence of a QTL than in its absence. The LOD threshold value for avoiding a false positive with a given confidence, say 95%, depends on the number of markers and the length of the genome. Graphs indicating LOD thresholds are set forth in Lander and Botstein, <highlight><italic>Genetics, </italic></highlight>121:185-199 (1989), and further described by Ar&uacute;s and Moreno-Gonz&aacute;lez, <highlight><italic>Plant Breeding, </italic></highlight>Hayward, Bosemark, Romagosa (eds.) Chapman &amp; Hall, London, pp. 314-331 (1993). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Additional models can be used. Many modifications and alternative approaches to interval mapping have been reported, including the use of non-parametric methods (Kruglyak and Lander, <highlight><italic>Genetics, </italic></highlight>139:1421-1428 (1995)). Multiple regression methods or models can be also be used, in which the trait is regressed on a large number of markers (Jansen, <highlight><italic>Biometrics in Plant Breed, </italic></highlight>van Oijen, Jansen (eds.) Proceedings of the Ninth Meeting of the Eucarpia Section Biometrics in Plant Breeding, The Netherlands, pp. 116-124 (1994); Weber and Wricke, Advances in Plant Breeding, Blackwell, Berlin, 16 (1994)). Procedures combining interval mapping with regression analysis, whereby the phenotype is regressed onto a single putative QTL at a given marker interval, and at the same time onto a number of markers that serve as &lsquo;cofactors,&rsquo; have been reported by Jansen and Stam, <highlight><italic>Genetics, </italic></highlight>136:1447-1455 (1994) and Zeng, <highlight><italic>Genetics, </italic></highlight>136:1457-1468 (1994). Generally, the use of cofactors reduces the bias and sampling error of the estimated QTL positions (Utz and Melchinger, <highlight><italic>Biometrics in Plant Breeding, </italic></highlight>van Oijen, Jansen (eds.) Proceedings of the Ninth Meeting of the Eucarpia Section Biometrics in Plant Breeding, The Netherlands, pp.195-204 (1994), thereby improving the precision and efficiency of QTL mapping (Zeng, <highlight><italic>Genetics, </italic></highlight>136:1457-1468 (1994)). These models can be extended to multi-environment experiments to analyze genotype-environment interactions (Jansen et al., <highlight><italic>Theo. Appl. Genet. </italic></highlight>91:33-37 (1995)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Selection of an appropriate mapping or segregation populations is important to map construction. The choice of appropriate mapping population depends on the type of marker systems employed (Tanksley et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular mapping plant chromosomes. Chromosome structure and function: Impact of new concepts </italic></highlight>J. P. Gustafson and R. Appels (eds.), Plenum Press, New York, pp. 157-173 (1988)). Consideration must be given to the source of parents (adapted vs. exotic) used in the mapping population. Chromosome pairing and recombination rates can be severely disturbed (suppressed) in wide crosses (adapted x exotic) and generally yield greatly reduced linkage distances. Wide crosses will usually provide segregating populations with a relatively large array of polymorphisms when compared to progeny in a narrow cross (adapted x adapted). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the progeny include not only, without limitation, the products of any cross (be it a backcross or otherwise) between two plants, but all progeny whose pedigree traces back to the original cross. Specifically, without limitation, such progeny include plants that have 12.5% or less genetic material derived from one of the two originally crossed plants. As used herein, a second plant is derived from a first plant if the second plant&apos;s pedigree includes the first plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> An F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>population is the first generation of selfing after the hybrid seed is produced. Usually a single F<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>plant is selfed to generate a population segregating for all the genes in Mendelian (1:2:1) fashion. Maximum genetic information is obtained from a completely classified F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>population using a codorninant marker system (Mather, Measurement of Linkage in Heredity: Methuen and Co., (1938)). In the case of dominant markers, progeny tests (e.g., F<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, BCF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) are required to identify the heterozygotes, thus making it equivalent to a completely classified F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>population. However, this procedure is often prohibitive because of the cost and time involved in progeny testing. Progeny testing of F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>individuals is often used in map construction where phenotypes do not consistently reflect genotype (e.g., disease resistance) or where trait expression is controlled by a QTL. Segregation data from progeny test populations (e.g., F<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>or BCF<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) can be used in map construction. Marker-assisted selection can then be applied to cross progeny based on marker-trait map associations (F<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, F<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>), where linkage groups have not been completely disassociated by recombination events (i.e., maximum disequilibrium). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Recombinant inbred lines (RIL) (genetically related lines; usually &gt;F<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, developed from continuously selfing F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>lines towards homozygosity) can be used as a mapping population. Information obtained from dominant markers can be maximized by using RIL because all loci are homozygous or nearly so. Under conditions of tight linkage (i.e., about &lt;10% recombination), dominant and co-dominant markers evaluated in RIL populations provide more information per individual than either marker type in backcross populations (Reiter et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 89:1477-1481 (1992)). However, as the distance between markers becomes larger (i.e., loci become more independent), the information in RIL populations decreases dramatically when compared to codominant markers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Backcross populations (e.g., generated from a cross between a successful variety (recurrent parent) and another variety (donor parent) carrying a trait not present in the former) can be utilized as a mapping population. A series of backcrosses to the recurrent parent can be made to recover most of its desirable traits. Thus a population is created consisting of individuals nearly like the recurrent parent but each individual carries varying amounts or mosaic of genomic regions from the donor parent. Backcross populations can be useful for mapping dominant markers if all loci in the recurrent parent are homozygous and the donor and recurrent parent have contrasting polymorphic marker alleles (Reiter et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 89:1477-1481 (1992)). Information obtained from backcross populations using either codominant or dominant markers is less than that obtained from F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>populations because one, rather than two, recombinant gametes are sampled per plant. Backcross populations, however, are more informative (at low marker saturation) when compared to RELs as the distance between linked loci increases in RIL populations (i.e., about 0.15% recombination). Increased recombination can be beneficial for resolution of tight linkages, but may be undesirable in the construction of maps with low marker saturation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Near-isogenic lines (NIL) created by many backcrosses to produce an array of individuals that are nearly identical in genetic composition except for the trait or genomic region under interrogation can be used as a mapping population. In mapping with NILs, only a portion of the polymorphic loci are expected to map to a selected region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Bulk segregant analysis (BSA) is a method developed for the rapid identification of linkage between markers and traits of interest (Michelmore, et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 88:9828-9832 (1991)). In BSA, two bulked DNA samples are drawn from a segregating population originating from a single cross. These bulks contain individuals that are identical for a particular trait (resistant or sensitive to particular disease) or genomic region but arbitrary at unlinked regions (i.e., heterozygous). Regions unlinked to the target region will not differ between the bulked samples of many individuals in BSA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Plants generated using a method of the present invention can be part of or generated from a breeding program. The choice of breeding method depends on the mode of plant reproduction, the heritability of the trait(s) being improved, and the type of cultivar used commercially (e.g., F<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>hybrid cultivar, pureline cultivar, etc). Selected, non-limiting approaches, for breeding the plants of the present invention are set forth below. A breeding program can be enhanced using marker assisted selection of the progeny of any cross. It is further understood that any commercial and non-commercial cultivars can be utilized in a breeding program. Factors such as, for example, emergence vigor, vegetative vigor, stress tolerance, disease resistance, branching, flowering, seed set, seed size, seed density, standability, and threshability etc. will generally dictate the choice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> For highly heritable traits, a choice of superior individual plants evaluated at a single location will be effective, whereas for traits with low heritability, selection should be based on mean values obtained from replicated evaluations of families of related plants. Popular selection methods commonly include pedigree selection, modified pedigree selection, mass selection, and recurrent selection. In a preferred embodiment a backcross or recurrent breeding program is undertaken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> The complexity of inheritance influences choice of the breeding method. Backcross breeding can be used to transfer one or a few favorable genes for a highly heritable trait into a desirable cultivar. This approach has been used extensively for breeding disease-resistant cultivars. Various recurrent selection techniques are used to improve quantitatively inherited traits controlled by numerous genes. The use of recurrent selection in self-pollinating crops depends on the ease of pollination, the frequency of successful hybrids from each pollination, and the number of hybrid offspring from each successful cross. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> Breeding lines can be tested and compared to appropriate standards in environments representative of the commercial target area(s) for two or more generations. The best lines are candidates for new commercial cultivars; those still deficient in traits may be used as parents to produce new populations for further selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> One method of identifying a superior plant is to observe its performance relative to other experimental plants and to a widely grown standard cultivar. If a single observation is inconclusive, replicated observations can provide a better estimate of its genetic worth. A breeder can select and cross two or more parental lines, followed by repeated selfing and selection, producing many new genetic combinations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> The development of new soybean cultivars requires the development and selection of soybean varieties, the crossing of these varieties and selection of superior hybrid crosses. The hybrid seed can be produced by manual crosses between selected male-fertile parents or by using male sterility systems. Hybrids are selected for certain single gene traits such as pod color, flower color, seed yield, pubescence color or herbicide resistance which indicate that the seed is truly a hybrid. Additional data on parental lines, as well as the phenotype of the hybrid, influence the breeder&apos;s decision whether to continue with the specific hybrid cross. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Pedigree breeding and recurrent selection breeding methods can be used to develop cultivars from breeding populations. Breeding programs combine desirable traits from two or more cultivars or various broad-based sources into breeding pools from which cultivars are developed by selfing and selection of desired phenotypes. New cultivars can be evaluated to determine which have commercial potential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Pedigree breeding is used commonly for the improvement of self-pollinating crops. Two parents who possess favorable, complementary traits are crossed to produce an F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. An F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>population is produced by selfing one or several F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&apos;s. Selection of the best individuals in the best families is performed. Replicated testing of families can begin in the F<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>generation to improve the effectiveness of selection for traits with low heritability. At an advanced stage of inbreeding (i.e., F<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>and F<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>), the best lines or mixtures of phenotypically similar lines are tested for potential release as new cultivars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Backcross breeding has been used to transfer genes for a simply inherited, highly heritable trait into a desirable homozygous cultivar or inbred line, which is the recurrent parent. The source of the trait to be transferred is called the donor parent. The resulting plant is expected to have the attributes of the recurrent parent (e.g., cultivar) and the desirable trait transferred from the donor parent. After the initial cross, individuals possessing the phenotype of the donor parent are selected and repeatedly crossed (backcrossed) to the recurrent parent. The resulting parent is expected to have the attributes of the recurrent parent (e.g., cultivar) and the desirable trait transferred from the donor parent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The single-seed descent procedure in the strict sense refers to planting a segregating population, harvesting a sample of one seed per plant, and using the one-seed sample to plant the next generation. When the population has been advanced from the F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to the desired level of inbreeding, the plants from which lines are derived will each trace to different F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>individuals. The number of plants in a population declines each generation due to failure of some seeds to germinate or some plants to produce at least one seed. As a result, not all of the F<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>plants originally sampled in the population will be represented by a progeny when generation advance is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> In a multiple-seed procedure, soybean breeders commonly harvest one or more pods from each plant in a population and thresh them together to form a bulk. Part of the bulk is used to plant the next generation and part is put in reserve. The procedure has been referred to as modified single-seed descent or the pod-bulk technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The multiple-seed procedure has been used to save labor at harvest. It is considerably faster to thresh pods with a machine than to remove one seed from each by hand for the single-seed procedure. The multiple-seed procedure also makes it possible to plant the same number of seeds of a population each generation of inbreeding. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;substantially purified,&rdquo; as used herein, refers to a molecule separated from substantially all other molecules normally associated with it in its native state. More preferably a substantially purified molecule is the predominant species present in a preparation. A substantially purified molecule may be greater than 60% free, preferably 75% free, more preferably 90% free, and most preferably 95% free from the other molecules (exclusive of solvent) present in the natural mixture. The term &ldquo;substantially purified&rdquo; is not intended to encompass molecules present in their native state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> The agents of the present invention will preferably be &ldquo;biologically active&rdquo; with respect to either a structural attribute, such as the capacity of a nucleic acid to hybridize to another nucleic acid molecule, or the ability of a protein to be bound by an antibody (or to compete with another molecule for such binding).

<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Nucleic acid molecules or fragments thereof of the present invention are capable of specifically hybridizing to other nucleic acid molecules under certain circumstances. As used herein, two nucleic acid molecules are said to be capable of specifically hybridizing to one another if the two molecules are capable of forming an anti-parallel, double-stranded nucleic acid structure. A nucleic acid molecule is said to be the &ldquo;complement&rdquo; of another nucleic acid molecule if they exhibit &ldquo;complete complementarity,&rdquo; i.e., each nucleotide in one sequence is complementary to its base pairing partner nucleotide in another sequence. Two molecules are said to be &ldquo;minimally complementary&rdquo; if they can hybridize to one another with sufficient stability to permit them to remain annealed to one another under at least conventional &ldquo;low-stringency&rdquo; conditions. Similarly, the molecules are said to be &ldquo;complementary&rdquo; if they can hybridize to one another with sufficient stability to permit them to remain annealed to one another under conventional &ldquo;high-stringency&rdquo; conditions. Nucleic acid molecules which hybridize to other nucleic acid molecules, e.g., at least under low stringency conditions are said to be &ldquo;hybridizable cognates&rdquo; of the other nucleic acid molecules. Conventional stringency conditions are described by Sambrook et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning, </italic></highlight>A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989) and by Haymes et al., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acid Hybridization, A Practical Approach, IRL Press, Washington, D.C. (</italic></highlight>1985). Departures from complete complementarity are therefore permissible, as long as such departures do not completely preclude the capacity of the molecules to form a double-stranded structure. Thus, in order for a nucleic acid molecule to serve as a primer or probe it need only be sufficiently complementary in sequence to be able to form a stable double-stranded structure under the particular solvent and salt concentrations employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0221" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0221&rsqb;</number> Appropriate stringency conditions which promote DNA hybridization, for example, 6.0&times; sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC) at about 45&deg; C., followed by a wash of 2.0&times; SSC at 50&deg; C., are known to those skilled in the art or can be found in <highlight><italic>Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, </italic></highlight>John Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y. (1989), 6.3.1-6.3.6. For example, the salt concentration in the wash step can be selected from a low stringency of about 2.0&times; SSC at 50&deg; C. to a high stringency of about 0.2&times; SSC at 50&deg; C. In addition, the temperature in the wash step can be increased from low stringency conditions at room temperature, about 22&deg; C., to high stringency conditions at about 65&deg; C. Both temperature and salt may be varied, or either the temperature or the salt concentration may be held constant while the other variable is changed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0222" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0222&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, a nucleic acid of the present invention will specifically hybridize to one or more of the nucleic acid molecules set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 through SEQ ID NO: 1096 or complements thereof under moderately stringent conditions, for example at about 2.0&times; SSC and about 65&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> In a particularly preferred embodiment, a nucleic acid of the present invention will include those nucleic acid molecules that specifically hybridize to one or more of the nucleic acid molecules set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 through SEQ ID NO: 1096 or complements thereof under high stringency conditions such as 0.2&times; SSC and about 65&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0224" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0224&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the present invention, the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention comprise one or more of the nucleic acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 through SEQ ID NO: 1096 or complements thereof or fragments of either. In another aspect of the present invention, one or more of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention share at least 60% sequence identity with one or more of the nucleic acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 through SEQ ID NO: 1096 or complements thereof or fragments of either. In a further aspect of the present invention, one or more of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention share at least 70% or more, e.g., at least 80%, sequence identity with one or more of the nucleic acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 through SEQ ID NO: 1096 or complements thereof or fragments of either. In a more preferred aspect of the present invention, one or more of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention share at least 90% or more, e.g., at least 95% and up to 100% sequence identity with one or more of the nucleic acid sequences set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 through SEQ ID NO: 1096 complements thereof or fragments of either. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> As used herein &ldquo;sequence identity&rdquo; refers to the extent to which two optimally aligned polynucleotide or peptide sequences are invariant throughout a window of alignment of components, e.g., nucleotides or amino acids. An &ldquo;identity fraction&rdquo; for aligned segments of a test sequence and a reference sequence is the number of identical components which are shared by the two aligned sequences divided by the total number of components in reference sequence segment, i.e., the entire reference sequence or a smaller defined part of the reference sequence. &ldquo;Percent identity&rdquo; is the identity fraction times 100. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> Useful methods for determining sequence identity are disclosed in Guide to Huge Computers, Martin J. Bishop, ed., Academic Press, San Diego, 1994, and Carillo, H., and Lipton, D., SIAM J Applied Math (1988) 48:1073. More particularly, preferred computer programs for determining sequence identity include the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) programs which are publicly available from National Center Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Library of Medicine, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md. 20894; see BLAST Manual, Altschul et al., NCBI, NLM, NIH; Altschul et al., <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>215:403-410 (1990); version 2.0 or higher of BLAST programs allows the introduction of gaps (deletions and insertions) into alignments; BLASTX can be used to determine sequence identity between a polynucleotide sequence query and a protein sequence database; and, BLASTN can be used to determine sequence identity between between sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> For purposes of this invention &ldquo;percent identity&rdquo; shall be determined using BLASTX version 2.0.14 (default parameters), BLASTN version 2.0.14, or BLASTP 2.0.14. A particularly preferred group of nucleic acid sequences are those present in the soybean insert of the clones set forth in table 6 below.

<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes nucleic acid molecules that code for an rhg1 protein or fragment thereof. Examples of such nucleic acid molecules include those that code for the proteins set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 1097, 1100, 1098, 1101, and 1102-1115. Examples of illustrative fragment molecules include, without limitation, an extracellular LRR domain (rhg1, v.1, SEQ ID NO: 1097, residues 164-457; rhg1, v.2, SEQ ID NO: 1098, residues 141-434), a transmembrane domain (rhg1, v.1, SEQ ID NO: 1097, residues 508-530; rhg1, v.2, SEQ ID NO: 1098, residues 33-51 and 485-507), and an STK domain (rhg1, v.1, SEQ ID NO: 1097, residues 578-869; rhg1, v.2, SEQ ID NO: 1098, residues 555-846).

Examples of illustrative fragment molecules include, without limitation, an extracellular LRR domain (SEQ ID NO: 1099, residues 34-44), a transmembrane domain (SEQ ID NO: 1099, residues 449-471), and an STK domain (SEQ ID NO: 1099, residues 531-830).

<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> In another further aspect of the present invention, nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can comprise sequences which differ from those encoding a protein or fragment thereof in SEQ ID NO: 1097 through SEQ ID NO: 1119 due to fact that the different nucleic acid sequence encodes a protein having one or more conservative amino acid changes. It is understood that codons capable of coding for such conservative amino acid substitutions are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> It is well known in the art that one or more amino acids in a native sequence can be substituted with another amino acid(s), the charge and polarity of which are similar to that of the native amino acid, i.e., a conservative amino acid substitution. Conserved substitutions for an amino acid within the native polypeptide sequence can be selected from other members of the class to which the naturally occurring amino acid belongs. Amino acids can be divided into the following four groups: (1) acidic amino acids, (2) basic amino acids, (3) neutral polar amino acids, and (4) neutral nonpolar amino acids. Representative amino acids within these various groups include, but are not limited to: (1) acidic (negatively charged) amino acids such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid; (2) basic (positively charged) amino acids such as arginine, histidine, and lysine; (3) neutral polar amino acids such as glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, cystine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine; and (4) neutral nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids such as alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Conservative amino acid changes within the native polypeptides sequence can be made by substituting one amino acid within one of these groups with another amino acid within the same group. Biologically functional equivalents of the proteins or fragments thereof of the present invention can have ten or fewer conservative amino acid changes, more preferably seven or fewer conservative amino acid changes, and most preferably five or fewer conservative amino acid changes. The encoding nucleotide sequence will thus have corresponding base substitutions, permitting it to encode biologically functional equivalent forms of the proteins or fragments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> It is understood that certain amino acids may be substituted for other amino acids in a protein structure without appreciable loss of interactive binding capacity with structures such as, for example, antigen-binding regions of antibodies or binding sites on substrate molecules. Because it is the interactive capacity and nature of a protein that defines that protein&apos;s biological functional activity, certain amino acid sequence substitutions can be made in a protein sequence and, of course, its underlying DNA coding sequence and, nevertheless, obtain a protein with like properties. It is thus contemplated by the inventors that various changes may be made in the peptide sequences of the proteins or fragments of the present invention, or corresponding DNA sequences that encode said peptides, without appreciable loss of their biological utility or activity. It is understood that codons capable of coding for such amino acid changes are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> In making such changes, the hydropathic index of amino acids may be considered. The importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive biological function on a protein is generally understood in the art (Kyte and Doolittle, <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>157, 105-132 (1982). It is accepted that the relative hydropathic character of the amino acid contributes to the secondary structure of the resultant protein, which in turn defines the interaction of the protein with other molecules, for example, enzymes, substrates, receptors, DNA, antibodies, antigens, and the like. In making such changes, the substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within &plusmn;2 is preferred, those which are within &plusmn;1 are particularly preferred, and those within &plusmn;0.5 are even more particularly preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> It is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino acids can be made effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity. U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,101, states that the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein, as govern by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids, correlates with a biological property of the protein. In a further aspect of the present invention, one or more of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention differ in nucleic acid sequence from those encoding a peptide set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1097 through SEQ ID NO: 1119 or fragment thereof due to the fact that one or more codons encoding an amino acid has been substituted for a codon that encodes a nonessential substitution of the amino acid originally encoded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> Agents of the invention include nucleic acid molecules that encode at least about a contiguous 10 amino acid region of a protein of the present invention, more preferably at least D about a contiguous 11 to 14 or larger amino acid region of a protein of the present invention. It is understood that the present invention includes nucleic acid molecules that specifically hybridize or exhibit a particular identity to the nucleic acid molecules described in (i). See (a) above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0242" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0242&rsqb;</number> (ii) Nucleic Acid Molecule Markers and Collections of Such Molecules </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0243" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0243&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention concerns nucleic acid molecules of the present invention that can act as markers. As used herein, a &ldquo;marker&rdquo; is an indicator for the presence of at least one phenotype or polymorphism, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), cleaveable amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), simple sequence repeats (SSRs), or random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPDs). A &ldquo;nucleic acid marker&rdquo; as used herein means a nucleic acid molecule that is capable of being a marker for detecting a polymorphism or phenotype. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0244" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0244&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, the nucleic acid marker specifically hybridizes to a nucleic acid molecule having a nucleic acid sequence selected from the group SEQ NOs: 1-1096 and complements thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid marker is capable of detecting an rhg1 SNP or INDEL set forth in table 2. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid marker is capable of detecting an Rgh4 SNP or INDEL set forth in table 4. In another preferred embodiment the nucleic acid marker is a nucleic acid molecule capable of acting as a PCR primer to amplify an rhg1 or Rhg4 coding region. Examples of such primers include, without limitation, nucleic acid molecules having a nucleic acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 401-1096 and complements thereof. Such primers can be used in pairs to amplify a region (amplicons, e.g., without limitation, SEQ ID NOs: 54-400) that can be further investigated using techniques known in the art such as nucleic acid sequencing. Preferred pairs are those with identical &ldquo;Seq ID&rdquo; (see Description of the Sequence Listing) except for the fact that one &ldquo;Seq ID&rdquo; recites forward primer and one recites reverse primer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0245" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0245&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, the nucleic acid marker specifically hybridizes to a nucleic acid molecule having a sequence that is present on linkage group G within 500 kb or 100 kb, more preferably within 50 kb, even more preferably within 25 kb of an rhg1 allele, where the Rgh4 allele is preferably a sensitive allele, and more preferably a sensitive allele from A3244. In a preferred embodiment the nucleic acid marker specifically hybridizes to M5 a nucleic acid molecule having a sequence that is present on linkage group A2 within 500 kb or 100 kb, more preferably within 50 kb, even more preferably within 25 kb of an Rhg4 allele, where the Rgh4 allele is preferably a sensitive allele, and more preferably a sensitive allele from A3244. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0246" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0246&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a &ldquo;collection of nucleic acid molecules&rdquo; is a population of nucleic acid molecules where at least two, preferably all, of the nucleic acid molecules differ, at least in part, in their nucleic acid sequence. It is understood, that as used herein, an individual species within a collection of nucleic acid molecules may be physically separate or alternatively not physically separate from one or more other species within the collection of nucleic acid molecules. An example of a situation where individual species may be physically separate but considered a collection of nucleic acid molecules is where more than two species are present in a single location such as an array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0247" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0247&rsqb;</number> As used herein, where a collection of nucleic acid molecules is a marker for a particular attribute, the level, pattern, occurrence and/or absence of the nucleic acid molecules associated with the attribute are not required to be the same between species of the collection. For example, the increase in the level of a species when in combination with the decrease in a second species could be diagnostic for a particular attribute. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the level, pattern, occurrence and/or absence of a nucleic acid molecule and/or collection of nucleic acid molecules of the present invention is a marker for SCN resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0248" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0248&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the marker is any nucleic acid molecule that specifically hybridizes to any nucleic acid sequence set forth herein. In another embodiment, the marker is a marker capable of distinguishing among the haplotypes of either rhg1 or Rhg4. In yet another embodiment, more than one marker is used to simultaneously distinguish more than one haplotype.

<paragraph id="P-0255" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0255&rsqb;</number> One or more of the protein or peptide molecules may be produced via chemical synthesis, or more preferably, by expression in a suitable bacterial or eukaryotic host. Suitable methods for expression are described by Sambrook, et al., (In: <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, </italic></highlight>2<highlight><italic>nd Edition, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.

<paragraph id="P-0258" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0258&rsqb;</number> One or more of the nucleic acid molecules of the invention may be used in plant transformation or transfection. Exogenous genetic material may be transferred into a plant cell and the plant cell regenerated into a whole, fertile or sterile plant. Exogenous genetic material is any genetic material, whether naturally occurring or otherwise, from any source that is capable of being inserted into any organism.

<paragraph id="P-0262" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0262&rsqb;</number> Transfer of a nucleic acid that encodes for a protein can result in overexpression of that protein in a transformed cell or transgenic plant. One or more of the proteins or fragments thereof encoded by nucleic acid molecules of the invention may be overexpressed in a transformed cell or transformed plant. Such overexpression may be the result of transient or stable transfer of the exogenous genetic material. Such overexpression can also result in SCN resistance to one or more races of SCN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0263" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0263&rsqb;</number> Exogenous genetic material may be transferred into a host cell by the use of a DNA vector or construct designed for such a purpose. Design of such a vector is generally within the skill of the art (See, <highlight><italic>Plant Molecular Biology: A Laboratory Manual, </italic></highlight>Clark (ed.), Springier, New York (1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0264" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0264&rsqb;</number> A construct or vector may include a plant promoter to express the protein or protein fragment of choice. A number of promoters, which are active in plant cells, have been described in the literature. These include the nopaline synthase (NOS) promoter (Ebert et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 84:5745-5749 (1987), the octopine synthase (OCS) promoter (which are carried on tumor-inducing plasmids of Agrobacterium tumefaciens), the caulimovirus promoters such as the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 19S promoter (Lawton et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>9:315-324 (1987), and the CaMV 35S promoter (Odell et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>313:810-812 (1985), the figwort mosaic virus 35S-promoter, the light-inducible promoter from the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bis-phosphate carboxylase (ssRUBISCO), the Adh promoter (Walker et al., <highlight><italic>Proc.

The CaMV 35S promoters are preferred for use in plants. Promoters known or found to cause transcription of DNA in plant cells can be used in the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0265" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0265&rsqb;</number> For the purpose of expression in source tissues of the plant, such as the leaf, seed, root or stem, it is preferred that the promoters utilized have relatively high expression in these specific tissues. Tissue-specific expression of a protein of the present invention is a particularly preferred embodiment. For this purpose, one may choose from a number of promoters for genes with tissue- or cell-specific or -enhanced expression. Examples of such promoters reported in the literature include the chloroplast glutamine synthetase GS2 promoter from pea (Edwards et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 87:3459-3463 (1990), the chloroplast fructose-1,6-biphosphatase (FBPase) promoter from wheat (Lloyd et al., <highlight><italic>Mol. Gen. Genet. </italic></highlight>225:209-216 (1991), the nuclear photosynthetic ST-LS1 promoter from potato (Stockhaus et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>8:2445-2451 (1989), the STK (PAL) promoter and the glucoamylase (CHS) promoter from <highlight><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana. </italic></highlight>Also reported to be active in photosynthetically active tissues are the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RbcS) promoter from eastern larch (<highlight><italic>Larix laricina</italic></highlight>), the promoter for the cab gene, cab6, from pine (Yamamoto et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Cell Physiol. </italic></highlight>35:773-778 (1994), the promoter for the Cab-1 gene from wheat (Fejes et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>15:921-932 (1990), the promoter for the CAB-1 gene from spinach (Lubberstedt et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>104:997-1006 (1994), the promoter for the cab1R gene from rice (Luan et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Cell. </italic></highlight>4:971-981 (1992), the pyruvate, orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) promoter from maize (Matsuoka et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 90: 9586-9590 (1993), the promoter for the tobacco Lhcb1*2 gene (Cerdan et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>33:245-255 (1997), the Arabidopsis thaliana SUC2 sucrose-H&plus; symporter promoter (Truemit et al., <highlight><italic>Planta. </italic></highlight>196:564-570 (1995), and the promoter for the thylakoid membrane proteins from spinach (psaD, psaF, psaE, PC, FNR, atpC, atpD, cab, rbcS). Other promoters for the chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins may also be utilized in the invention, such as the promoters for LhcB gene and PsbP gene from white mustard (Sinapis alba; Kretsch et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>28:219-229 (1995)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0266" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0266&rsqb;</number> For the purpose of expression in sink tissues of the plant, such as the tuber of the potato plant, the fruit of tomato, or the seed of maize, wheat, rice and barley, it is preferred that the promoters utilized in the invention have relatively high expression in these specific tissues. A number of promoters for genes with tuber-specific or -enhanced expression are known, including the class I patatin promoter (Bevan et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>8:1899-1906 (1986); Jefferson et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>14:995-1006 (1990)), the promoter for the potato tuber ADPGPP genes, both the large and small subunits, the sucrose synthase promoter (Salanoubat and Belliard, <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>60:47-56 (1987), Salanoubat and Belliard, <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>84:181-185 (1989)), the promoter for the major tuber proteins including the 22 kd protein complexes and proteinase inhibitors (Hannapel, <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>101:703-704 (1993)), the promoter for the granule bound starch synthase gene (GBSS) (Visser et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>17:691-699 (1991)), and other class I and II patatins promoters (Koster-Topfer et al., <highlight><italic>Mol Gen Genet. </italic></highlight>219:390-396 (1989); Mignery et al., <highlight><italic>Gene. </italic></highlight>62:27-44 (1988)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0267" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0267&rsqb;</number> Other promoters can also be used to express a protein or fragment thereof in specific tissues, such as seeds or fruits. The promoter for P-conglycinin (Chen et al., <highlight><italic>Dev. Genet. </italic></highlight>10: 112-122 (1989)) or other seed-specific promoters such as the napin and phaseolin promoters, can be used. The zeins are a group of storage proteins found in maize endosperm. Genomic clones for zein genes have been isolated (Pedersen et al., <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>29:1015-1026 (1982)) and the promoters from these clones, including the 15 kD, 16 kD, 19 kD, 22 kD, 27 kD and genes, could also be used. Other promoters known to function, for example, in maize include the promoters for the following genes: waxy, Brittle, Shrunken 2, Branching enzymes I and II, starch synthases, debranching enzymes, oleosins, glutelins and sucrose synthases. A particularly preferred promoter for maize endosperm expression is the promoter for the glutelin gene from rice, more particularly the Osgt-1 promoter (Zheng et al., <highlight><italic>Mol. Cell Biol. </italic></highlight>13:5829-5842 (1993)). Examples of promoters suitable for expression in wheat include those promoters for the ADPglucose pyrosynthase (ADPGPP) subunits, the granule bound and other starch synthase, the branching and debranching enzymes, the embryogenesis-abundant proteins, the gliadins and the glutenins. Examples of such promoters in rice include those promoters for the ADPGPP subunits, the granule bound and other starch synthase, the branching enzymes, the debranching enzymes, sucrose synthases and the glutelins. A particularly preferred promoter is the promoter for rice glutelin, Osgt-1. Examples of such promoters for barley include those for the ADPGPP subunits, the granule bound and other starch synthase, the branching enzymes, the debranching enzymes, sucrose synthases, the hordeins, the embryo globulins and the aleurone specific proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0268" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0268&rsqb;</number> Root specific promoters may also be used. An example of such a promoter is the promoter for the acid chitinase gene (Samac et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>25:587-596 (1994)). Expression in root tissue could also be accomplished by utilizing the root specific subdomains of the CaMV35S promoter that have been identified (Lam et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 86:7890-7894 (1989)). Other root cell specific promoters include those reported by Conkling et al. (Conkling et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>93:1203-1211 (1990)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0269" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0269&rsqb;</number> Additional promoters that may be utilized are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,378,619; 5,391,725; 5,428,147; 5,447,858; 5,608,144; 5,608,144; 5,614,399; 5,633,441; 5,633,435; and 4,633,436. In addition, a tissue specific enhancer may be used (From et al., <highlight><italic>The Plant Cell </italic></highlight>1:977-984 (1989)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0270" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0270&rsqb;</number> Preferred promoters are those set forth in Section (a)(iii) of Agents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0271" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0271&rsqb;</number> Constructs or vectors may also include, with the coding region of interest, a nucleic acid sequence that acts, in whole or in part, to terminate transcription of that region. A number of such sequences have been isolated, including the Tr7 3&prime; sequence and the NOS 3&prime; sequence (Ingelbrecht et al., <highlight><italic>The Plant Cell </italic></highlight>1:671-680 (1989); Bevan et al., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>11:369-385 (1983)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0272" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0272&rsqb;</number> A vector or construct may also include regulatory elements. Examples of such include the Adh intron 1 (Callis et al., <highlight><italic>Genes and Develop. </italic></highlight>1:1183-1200 (1987)), the sucrose synthase intron (Vasil et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>91:1575-1579 (1989)) and the TMV omega element (Gallie et al., <highlight><italic>The Plant Cell </italic></highlight>1:301-311 (1989)). These and other regulatory elements may be included when appropriate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0273" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0273&rsqb;</number> A vector or construct may also include a selectable marker. Selectable markers may also be used to select for plants or plant cells that contain the exogenous genetic material. Examples of such include, but are not limited to: a neomycin phosphotransferase gene (U.S. Pat. No. 5,034,322), which codes for kanamycin resistance and can be selected for using kanamycin, G418, etc.; a bar gene which codes for bialaphos resistance; genes which encode glyphosate resistance (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,940,835; 5,188,642; 4,971,908; 5,627,061); a nitrilase gene which confers resistance to bromoxynil (Stalker et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>263:6310-6314 (1988)); a mutant acetolactate synthase gene (ALS) which confers imidazolinone or sulphonylurea resistance (European Patent Application 154,204 (Sept. 11, 1985)); and a methotrexate resistant DHFR gene (Thillet et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>263:12500-12508 (1988)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0274" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0274&rsqb;</number> A vector or construct may also include DNA sequence which encodes a transit peptide. Incorporation of a suitable chloroplast transit peptide may also be employed (European Patent Application Publication Number 0218571). Translational enhancers may also be incorporated as part of the vector DNA. DNA constructs could contain one or more 5&prime; non-translated leader sequences which may serve to enhance expression of the gene products from the resulting mRNA transcripts. Such sequences may be derived from the promoter selected to express the gene or can be specifically modified to increase translation of the mRNA. Such regions may also be obtained from viral RNAs, from suitable eukaryotic genes, or from a synthetic gene sequence. For a review of optimizing expression of transgenes, see Koziel et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>32:393-405 (1996). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0275" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0275&rsqb;</number> A vector or construct may also include a screenable marker. Screenable markers may be used to monitor expression. Exemplary screenable markers include: a &bgr;-glucuronidase or uidA gene (GUS) which encodes an enzyme for which various chromogenic substrates are known (Jefferson, <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol, Rep. </italic></highlight>5:387-405 (1987); Jefferson et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>6:3901-3907 (1987)); an R-locus gene, which encodes a product that regulates the production of anthocyanin pigments (red color) in plant tissues (Dellaporta et al., <highlight><italic>Stadler Symposium </italic></highlight>11:263-282 (1988)); a P-lactamase gene (Sutcliffe et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 75:3737-3741 (1978)), a gene which encodes an enzyme for which various chromogenic substrates are known (e.g., PADAC, a chromogenic cephalosporin); a luciferase gene (Ow et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>234:856-859 (1986)); a xylE gene (Zukowsky et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 80:1101-1105 (1983)) which encodes a catechol dioxygenase that can convert chromogenic catechols; an o-amylase gene (Ikatu et al., Bio/Technol. 8:241-242 (1990)); a tyrosinase gene (Katz et al., <highlight><italic>J. Gen. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>129:2703-2714 (1983)) which encodes an enzyme capable of oxidizing tyrosine to DOPA and dopaquinone which in turn condenses to melanin; an &agr;-galactosidase, which will turn a chromogenic &agr;-galactose substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0276" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0276&rsqb;</number> Included within the terms &ldquo;selectable or screenable marker genes&rdquo; are also genes which encode a secretable marker whose secretion can be detected as a means of identifying or selecting for transformed cells. Examples include markers which encode a secretable antigen that can be identified by antibody interaction, or even secretable enzymes which can be detected catalytically. Secretable proteins fall into a number of classes, including small, diffusible proteins which are detectable, (e.g., by ELISA), small active enzymes which are detectable in extracellular solution (e.g., &agr;-amylase, &bgr;-lactamase, phosphinothricin transferase), or proteins which are inserted or trapped in the cell wall (such as proteins which include a leader sequence such as that found in the expression unit of extension or tobacco PR-S). Other possible selectable and/or screenable marker genes will be apparent to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0277" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0277&rsqb;</number> There are many methods for introducing transforming nucleic acid molecules into plant cells. Suitable methods are believed to include virtually any method by which nucleic acid molecules may be introduced into a cell, such as by Agrobacterium infection or direct delivery of nucleic acid molecules such as, for example, by PEG-mediated transformation, by electroporation or by acceleration of DNA coated particles, etc (Potrykus, <highlight><italic>Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>42:205-225 (1991); Vasil, <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>25:925-937 (1994)). For example, electroporation has been used to transform maize protoplasts (Fromm et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>312:791-793 (1986)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0278" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0278&rsqb;</number> Other vector systems suitable for introducing transforming DNA into a host plant cell include but are not limited to binary artificial chromosome (BIBAC) vectors (Hamilton et al., <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>200:107-116 (1997)); and transfection with RNA viral vectors (Della-Cioppa et al., <highlight><italic>Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(1996), 792 (Engineering Plants for Commercial Products and Applications), 57-61). Additional vector systems also include plant selectable YAC vectors such as those described in Mullen et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Breeding </italic></highlight>4:449-457 (1988)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0279" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0279&rsqb;</number> Technology for introduction of DNA into cells is well known to those of skill in the art. Four general methods for delivering a gene into cells have been described: (1) chemical methods (Graham and van der Eb, <highlight><italic>Virology </italic></highlight>54:536-539 (1973)); (2) physical methods such as microinjection (Capecchi, <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>22:479-488 (1980)), electroporation (Wong and Neumann, <highlight><italic>Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commnun. </italic></highlight>107:584-587 (1982); Fromm et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 82:5824-5828 (1985); U.S. Pat. No. 5,384,253); and the gene gun (Johnston and Tang, <highlight><italic>Methods Cell Biol. </italic></highlight>43:353-365 (1994)); (3) viral vectors (Clapp, <highlight><italic>Clin. Perinatol. </italic></highlight>20:155-168 (1993); Lu et al., <highlight><italic>J. Exp. Med </italic></highlight>178:2089-2096 (1993); Eglitis and Anderson, <highlight><italic>Biotechniques </italic></highlight>6:608-614 (1988)); and (4) receptor-mediated mechanisms (Curiel et al., <highlight><italic>Hum. Gen. Ther. </italic></highlight>3:147-154 (1992), Wagner et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>USA</italic></highlight>) 89:6099-6103 (1992)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0280" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0280&rsqb;</number> Acceleration methods that may be used include, for example, microprojectile bombardment and the like. One example of a method for delivering transforming nucleic acid molecules to plant cells is microprojectile bombardment. This method has been reviewed by Yang and Christou (eds.), <highlight><italic>Particle Bombardment Technology for Gene Transfer, </italic></highlight>Oxford Press, Oxford, England (1994)). Non-biological particles (microprojectiles) that may be coated with nucleic acids and delivered into cells by a propelling force. Exemplary particles include those comprised of tungsten, gold, platinum and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0281" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0281&rsqb;</number> A particular advantage of microprojectile bombardment, in addition to it being an effective means of reproducibly transforming monocots, is that neither the isolation of protoplasts (Cristou et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>87:671-674 (1988)) nor the susceptibility of Agrobacterium infection are required. An illustrative embodiment of a method for delivering DNA into maize cells by acceleration is a biolistics &agr;-particle delivery system, which can be used to propel particles coated with DNA through a screen, such as a stainless steel or Nytex screen, onto a filter surface covered with corn cells cultured in suspension. Gordon-Kamm et al., describes the basic procedure for coating tungsten particles with DNA (Gordon-Kamm et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Cell </italic></highlight>2:603-618 (1990)). The screen disperses the tungsten nucleic acid particles so that they are not delivered to the recipient cells in large aggregates. A particle delivery system suitable for use with the invention is the helium acceleration PDS-1000/He gun is available from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.)(Sanford et al., Technique 3:3-16 (1991)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0282" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0282&rsqb;</number> For the bombardment, cells in suspension may be concentrated on filters. Filters containing the cells to be bombarded are positioned at an appropriate distance below the microprojectile stopping plate. If desired, one or more screens are also positioned between the gun and the cells to be bombarded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0283" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0283&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, immature embryos or other target cells may be arranged on solid culture medium. The cells to be bombarded are positioned at an appropriate distance below the microprojectile stopping plate. If desired, one or more screens are also positioned between the acceleration device and the cells to be bombarded. Through the use of techniques set forth herein one may obtain up to 1000 or more foci of cells transiently expressing a screenable or selectable marker gene. The number of cells in a focus which express the exogenous gene product 48 hours post-bombardment often range from one to ten and average one to three. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0284" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0284&rsqb;</number> In bombardment transformation, one may optimize the pre-bombardment culturing conditions and the bombardment parameters to yield the maximum numbers of stable transformants. Both the physical and biological parameters for bombardment are important in this technology. Physical factors are those that involve manipulating the DNA/microprojectile precipitate or those that affect the flight and velocity of either the macro- or microprojectiles. Biological factors include all steps involved in manipulation of cells before and immediately after bombardment, the osmotic adjustment of target cells to help alleviate the trauma associated with bombardment and also the nature of the transforming DNA, such as linearized DNA or intact supercoiled plasmids. It is believed that pre-bombardment manipulations are especially important for successful transformation of immature embryos. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0285" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0285&rsqb;</number> In another alternative embodiment, plastids can be stably transformed. Methods disclosed for plastid transformation in higher plants include the particle gun delivery of DNA containing a selectable marker and targeting of the DNA to the plastid genome through homologous recombination (Svab et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 87:8526-8530 (1990); Svab and Maliga, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 90:913-917 (1993); Staub and Maliga, EMBO J. 12:601-606 (1993); U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,451,513 and 5,545,818). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0286" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0286&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is contemplated that one may wish to adjust various aspects of the bombardment parameters in small-scale studies to fully optimize the conditions. One may particularly wish to adjust physical parameters such as gap distance, flight distance, tissue distance and helium pressure. One may also minimize the trauma reduction factors by modifying conditions which influence the physiological state of the recipient cells and which may therefore influence transformation and integration efficiencies. For example, the osmotic state, tissue hydration and the subculture stage or cell cycle of the recipient cells may be adjusted for optimum transformation. The execution of other routine adjustments will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0287" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0287&rsqb;</number> Agrobacterium-mediated transfer is a widely applicable system for introducing genes into plant cells because the DNA can be introduced into whole plant tissues, thereby bypassing the need for regeneration of an intact plant from a protoplast. The use of Agrobacterium-mediated El5s plant integrating vectors to introduce DNA into plant cells is well known in the art. See, for example the methods described by Fraley et al., <highlight><italic>Bio/Technology </italic></highlight>3:629-635 (1985) and Rogers et al., <highlight><italic>Methods Enzymol. </italic></highlight>153:253-277 (1987). Further, the integration of the T-DNA is a relatively precise process resulting in few rearrangements. The region of DNA to be transferred is defined by the border sequences and intervening DNA is usually inserted into the plant genome as described (Spielmann et al., <highlight><italic>Mol. Gen. Genet. </italic></highlight>205:34 (1986)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0288" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0288&rsqb;</number> Modem Agrobacterium transformation vectors are capable of replication in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>as well as Agrobacterium, allowing for convenient manipulations as described (Klee et al., In: <highlight><italic>Plant DNA Infectious Agents, </italic></highlight>Hohn and Schell (eds.), Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 179-203 (1985)). Moreover, technological advances in vectors for Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer have improved the arrangement of genes and restriction sites in the vectors to facilitate construction of vectors capable of expressing various polypeptide coding genes. The vectors described have convenient multi-linker regions flanked by a promoter and a polyadenylation site for direct expression of inserted polypeptide coding genes and are suitable for present purposes (Rogers et al., <highlight><italic>Methods Enzymol. </italic></highlight>153:253-277 (1987)). In addition, Agrobacterium containing both armed and disarmed Ti genes can be used for the transformations. In those plant strains where Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is efficient, it is the method of choice because of the facile and defined nature of the gene transfer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0289" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0289&rsqb;</number> A transgenic plant formed using Agrobacterium transformation methods typically contains a single gene on one chromosome. Such transgenic plants can be referred to as being heterozygous for the added gene. More preferred is a transgenic plant that is homozygous for the added structural gene; i.e., a transgenic plant that contains two added genes, one gene at the same locus on each chromosome of a chromosome pair. A homozygous transgenic plant can be obtained by sexually mating (selfing) an independent segregant transgenic plant that contains a single added gene, germinating some of the seed produced and analyzing the resulting plants produced for the gene of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0290" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0290&rsqb;</number> It is also to be understood that two different transgenic plants can also be mated to produce offspring that contain two independently segregating, exogenous genes. Selfing of appropriate progeny can produce plants that are homozygous for both added, exogenous genes that encode a polypeptide of interest. Backcrossing to a parental plant and out-crossing with a non-transgenic plant are also contemplated, as is vegetative propagation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0291" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0291&rsqb;</number> Transformation of plant protoplasts can be achieved using methods based on calcium phosphate precipitation, polyethylene glycol treatment, electroporation and combinations of these treatments (See, for example, Potrykus et al., <highlight><italic>Mol. Gen. Genet. </italic></highlight>205:193-200 (1986); Lorz et al., <highlight><italic>Mol. Gen. Genet. </italic></highlight>199:178 (1985); Fromm et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>319:791 (1986); Uchimiya et al., <highlight><italic>Mol. Gen. Genet. </italic></highlight>204:204 (1986); Marcotte et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>335:454-457 (1988)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0292" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0292&rsqb;</number> Application of these systems to different plant strains depends upon the ability to regenerate that particular plant strain from protoplasts. Illustrative methods for the regeneration of cereals from protoplasts are described (Fujimura et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Tissue Culture Letters </italic></highlight>2:74 (1985); Toriyama et al., <highlight><italic>Theor Appl. Genet. </italic></highlight>205:34 (1986); Yamada et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Cell Rep. </italic></highlight>4:85 (1986); Abdullah et al., <highlight><italic>Biotechnology </italic></highlight>4:1087 (1986)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0293" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0293&rsqb;</number> To transform plant strains that cannot be successfully regenerated from protoplasts, other ways to introduce DNA into intact cells or tissues can be utilized. For example, regeneration of cereals from immature embryos or explants can be effected as described (Vasil, <highlight><italic>Biotechnology </italic></highlight>6:397 (1988)). In addition, &ldquo;particle gun&rdquo; or high-velocity microprojectile technology can be utilized (Vasil et al., <highlight><italic>Bio/Technology </italic></highlight>10:667 (1992)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0294" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0294&rsqb;</number> Using the latter technology, DNA is carried through the cell wall and into the cytoplasm on the surface of small metal particles as described (Klein et al., Nature 328:70 (1987); Klein et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 85:8502-8505 (1988); McCabe et al., Bio/Technology 6:923 (1988)). The metal particles penetrate through several layers of cells and thus allow the transformation of cells within tissue explants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0295" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0295&rsqb;</number> The regeneration, development and cultivation of plants from single plant protoplast transformants or from various transformed explants are well known in the art (Weissbach and Weissbach, In: <highlight><italic>Methods for Plant Molecular Biology, </italic></highlight>Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., (1988)). This regeneration and growth process typically includes the steps of selection of transformed cells, culturing those individualized cells through the usual stages of embryonic development through the rooted plantlet stage. Transgenic embryos and seeds are similarly regenerated. The resulting transgenic rooted shoots are thereafter planted in an appropriate plant growth medium such as soil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0296" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0296&rsqb;</number> The development or regeneration of plants containing the foreign, exogenous gene that encodes a protein of interest is well known in the art. Preferably, the regenerated plants are self-pollinated to provide homozygous transgenic plants. Otherwise, pollen obtained from the regenerated plants is crossed to seed-grown plants of agronomically important lines. Conversely, pollen from plants of these important lines is used to pollinate regenerated plants. A transgenic plant of the invention containing a desired polypeptide is cultivated using methods well known to one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0297" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0297&rsqb;</number> There are a variety of methods for the regeneration of plants from plant tissue. The particular method of regeneration will depend on the starting plant tissue and the particular plant species to be regenerated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0298" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0298&rsqb;</number> Methods for transforming dicots, primarily by use of Agrobacterium tumefaciens and obtaining transgenic plants have been published for cotton (U.S. Pat. No. 5,004,863; 5,159,135; 5,518,908); soybean (U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,834; 5,416,011; McCabe et al., <highlight><italic>Biotechnology </italic></highlight>6-923 (1988); Christou et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Physiol. </italic></highlight>87:671-674 (1988)); Brassica (U.S. Pat.

<paragraph id="P-0299" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0299&rsqb;</number> Transformation of monocotyledons using electroporation, particle bombardment and Agrobacterium have also been reported.

<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> Assays for gene expression based on the transient expression of cloned nucleic acid constructs have been developed by introducing the nucleic acid molecules into plant cells by polyethylene glycol treatment, electroporation, or particle bombardment (Marcotte et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>335:454-457 (1988); Marcotte et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Cell </italic></highlight>1:523-532 (1989); McCarty et al., <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>66:895-905 (1991); Hattori et al., <highlight><italic>Genes Dev. </italic></highlight>6:609-618 (1992); Goff et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>9:2517-2522 (1990)). Transient expression systems may be used to functionally dissect gene constructs (see generally, Mailga et al., <highlight><italic>Methods in Plant Molecular Biology, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor Press (1995)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> Any of the nucleic acid molecules of the invention may be introduced into a plant cell in a permanent or transient manner in combination with other genetic elements such as vectors, promoters, enhancers, etc. Further, any of the nucleic acid molecules of the invention may be introduced into a plant cell in a manner that allows for overexpression of the protein or fragment thereof encoded by the nucleic acid molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> Cosuppression is the reduction in expression levels, usually at the level of RNA, of a particular endogenous gene or gene family by the expression of a homologous sense construct Ig: that is capable of transcribing mRNA of the same strandedness as the transcript of the endogenous gene (Napoli et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Cell </italic></highlight>2:279-289 (1990); van der Krol et al., <highlight><italic>Plant Cell </italic></highlight>2:291-299 (1990)). Cosuppression may result from stable transformation with a single copy nucleic acid molecule that is homologous to a nucleic acid sequence found within the cell (Prolls and Meyer, <highlight><italic>Plant J. </italic></highlight>2:465-475 (1992)) or with multiple copies of a nucleic acid molecule that is homologous to a nucleic acid sequence found within the cell (Mittlesten et al., <highlight><italic>Mol. Gen. Genet. </italic></highlight>244:325-330 (1994)). Genes, even though different, linked to homologous promoters may result in the cosuppression of the linked genes (Vaucheret, <highlight><italic>C.R. Acad. Sci. III </italic></highlight>316:1471-1483 (1993); Flavell, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>U.S.A.</italic></highlight>) 91:3490-3496 (1994)); van Blokland et al., <highlight><italic>Plant J. </italic></highlight>6:861-877 (1994); Jorgensen, <highlight><italic>Trends Biotechnol. </italic></highlight>8:340-344 (1990); Meins and Kunz, In: <highlight><italic>Gene Inactivation and Homologous Recombination in Plants, </italic></highlight>Paszkowski (ed.), pp. 335-348, Kluwer Academic, Netherlands (1994)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> It is understood that one or more of the nucleic acids of the invention may be introduced into a plant cell and transcribed using an appropriate promoter with such transcription resulting in the cosuppression of an endogenous protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> Antisense approaches are a way of preventing or reducing gene function by targeting the genetic material (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,801,540 and 5,107,065 Mol et al., <highlight><italic>FEBS Lett. </italic></highlight>268:427-430 (1990)). The objective of the antisense approach is to use a sequence complementary to the target gene to block its expression and create a mutant cell line or organism in which the level of a single chosen protein is selectively reduced or abolished. Antisense techniques have several advantages over other &lsquo;reverse genetic&rsquo; approaches. The site of inactivation and its developmental effect can be manipulated by the choice of promoter for antisense genes or by the timing of external application or microinjection. Antisense can manipulate its specificity by selecting either unique regions of the target gene or regions where it shares homology to other related genes (Hiatt et al., In: <highlight><italic>Genetic Engineering, </italic></highlight>Setlow (ed.), Vol. 11, New York: Plenum 49-63 (1989)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> The principle of regulation by antisense RNA is that RNA that is complementary to the target mRNA is introduced into cells, resulting in specific RNA:RNA duplexes being formed by base pairing between the antisense substrate and the target mRNA (Green et al., <highlight><italic>Annu. Rev. Biochem. </italic></highlight>55:569-597 (1986)). Under one embodiment, the process involves the introduction and expression of an antisense gene sequence. Such a sequence is one in which part or all of the normal gene sequences are placed under a promoter in inverted orientation so that the &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; or complementary strand is transcribed into a noncoding antisense RNA that hybridizes with the target mRNA and interferes with its expression (Takayama and Inouye, <highlight><italic>Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>25:155-184 (1990)). An antisense vector is constructed by standard procedures and introduced into cells by transformation, transfection, electroporation, microinjection, infection, etc. The type of transformation and choice of vector will determine whether expression is transient or stable. The promoter used for the antisense gene may influence the level, timing, tissue, specificity, or inducibility of the antisense inhibition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the activity of a protein in a plant cell may be reduced or depressed by growing a transformed plant cell containing a nucleic acid molecule whose non-transcribed strand encodes a protein or fragment thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> Post transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) can result in virus immunity or gene silencing in plants. PTGS is induced by dsRNA and is mediated by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, present in the cytoplasm, that requires a dsRNA template. The dsRNA is formed by hybridization of complementary transgene mRNAs or complementary regions of the same transcript. Duplex formation can be accomplished by using transcripts from one sense gene and one antisense gene co-located in the plant genome, a single transcript that has self-complementarity, or sense and antisense transcripts from genes brought together by crossing. The dsRNA-dependent RNA polymerase makes a complementary strand from the transgene mRNA and RNAse molecules attach to this complementary strand (cRNA). These cRNA-RNAse molecules hybridize to the endogene mnRNA and cleave the single-stranded RNA adjacent to the hybrid. The cleaved single-stranded RNAs are further degraded by other host RNAses because one will lack a capped 5&prime; end and the other will lack a poly(A) tail (Waterhouse et al., <highlight><italic>PNAS </italic></highlight>95: 13959-13964 (1998)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0308" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0308&rsqb;</number> It is understood that one or more of the nucleic acids of the invention may be introduced into a plant cell and transcribed using an appropriate promoter with such transcription resulting in the postranscriptional gene silencing of an endogenous transcript. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0309" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0309&rsqb;</number> Antibodies have been expressed in plants (Hiatt et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>342:76-78 (1989); Conrad and Fielder, <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>26:1023-1030 (1994)). Cytoplasmic expression of a scFv (single-chain Fv antibodies) has been reported to delay infection by artichoke mottled crinkle virus. Transgenic plants that express antibodies directed against endogenous proteins may exhibit a physiological effect (Philips et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>16:4489-4496 (1997); Marion-Poll, <highlight><italic>Trends in Plant Science </italic></highlight>2:447-448 (1997)). For example, expressed anti-abscissic antibodies have been reported to result in a general perturbation of seed development (Philips et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>16: 4489-4496 (1997)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> Antibodies that are catalytic may also be expressed in plants (abzymes). The principle behind abzymes is that since antibodies may be raised against many molecules, this recognition ability can be directed toward generating antibodies that bind transition states to force a chemical reaction forward (Persidas, <highlight><italic>Nature Biotechnology </italic></highlight>15:1313-1315 (1997); Baca et al., <highlight><italic>Ann. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. </italic></highlight>26:461-493 (1997)). The catalytic abilities of abzymes may be enhanced by site directed mutagenesis. Examples of abzymes are, for example, set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos.: 5,658,753; 5,632,990; 5,631,137; 5,602,015; 5,559,538; 5,576,174; 5,500,358; 5,318,897; 5,298,409; 5,258,289 and 5,194,585. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> It is understood that any of the antibodies of the invention may be expressed in plants and that such expression can result in a physiological effect.

Such antibodies may be used to quantitatively or qualitatively detect the protein or peptide molecules of the present invention. As used herein, an antibody or peptide is said to &ldquo;specifically bind&rdquo; to a protein or peptide molecule of the present invention if such binding is not competitively inhibited by the presence of non-related molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> Nucleic acid molecules that encode all or part of the protein of the present invention can be expressed, via recombinant means, to yield protein or peptides that can in turn be used to elicit antibodies that are capable of binding the expressed protein or peptide. Such antibodies may be used in immunoassays for that protein. Such protein-encoding molecules, or their fragments may be a &ldquo;fusion&rdquo; molecule (i.e., a part of a larger nucleic acid molecule) such that, upon expression, a fusion protein is produced. It is understood that any of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention may be expressed, via recombinant means, to yield proteins or peptides encoded by these nucleic acid molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> The antibodies that specifically bind proteins and protein fragments of the present invention may be polyclonal or monoclonal and may comprise intact immunoglobulins, or antigen binding portions of immunoglobulins fragments (such as (F(ab&prime;), F(ab&prime;)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), or single-chain immunoglobulins producible, for example, via recombinant means. It is understood that practitioners are familiar with the standard resource materials which describe specific conditions and procedures for the construction, manipulation and isolation of antibodies (see, for example, Harlow and Lane, In: <highlight><italic>Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1988)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0316" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0316&rsqb;</number> Murine monoclonal antibodies are particularly preferred. BALB/c mice are preferred for this purpose, however, equivalent strains may also be used. The animals are preferably immunized with approximately 25 &mgr;g of purified protein (or fragment thereof) that has been emulsified in a suitable adjuvant (such as TiterMax adjuvant (Vaxcel, Norcross, Ga.)). Immunization is preferably conducted at two intramuscular sites, one intraperitoneal site and one subcutaneous site at the base of the tail. An additional i.v. injection of approximately 25 &mgr;g of antigen is preferably given in normal saline three weeks later. After approximately 11 days following the second injection, the mice may be bled and the blood screened for the presence of anti-protein or peptide antibodies. Preferably, a direct binding Enzyme-Linked Immunoassay (ELISA) is employed for this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0317" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0317&rsqb;</number> More preferably, the mouse having the highest antibody titer is given a third i.v. injection of approximately 25 &mgr;g of the same protein or fragment. The splenic leukocytes from this animal may be recovered 3 days later and then permitted to fuse, most preferably, using polyethylene glycol, with cells of a suitable myeloma cell line (such as, for example, the P3x63Ag8.653 myeloma cell line). Hybridoma cells are selected by culturing the cells under &ldquo;HAT&rdquo; (hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thyrnine) selection for about one week. The resulting clones may then be screened for their capacity to produce monoclonal antibodies (&ldquo;mAbs&rdquo;), preferably by direct ELISA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0318" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0318&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, anti-protein or peptide monoclonal antibodies are isolated using a fusion of a protein or peptide of the present invention, or conjugate of a protein or peptide of the present invention, as immunogens. Thus, for example, a group of mice can be immunized using a fusion protein emulsified in Freund&apos;s complete adjuvant (e.g., approximately 50 &mgr;g of antigen per immunization). At three week intervals, an identical amount of antigen is emulsified in Freund&apos;s incomplete adjuvant and used to immunize the animals. Ten days following the third immunization, serum samples are taken and evaluated for the presence of antibody. If antibody titers are too low, a fourth booster can be employed. Polysera capable of binding the protein or peptide can also be obtained using this method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0319" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0319&rsqb;</number> In a preferred procedure for obtaining monoclonal antibodies, the spleens of the above-described immunized mice are removed, disrupted and immune splenocytes are isolated over a ficoll gradient. The isolated splenocytes are fused, using polyethylene glycol with BALB/c-derived HGPRT (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase) deficient P3x63xAg8.653 plasmacytoma cells. The fused cells are plated into 96 well microtiter plates and screened for hybridoma fusion cells by their capacity to grow in culture medium supplemented with hypothanthine, aminopterin and thymidine for approximately 2-3 weeks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0320" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0320&rsqb;</number> Hybridoma cells that arise from such incubation are preferably screened for their capacity to produce an immunoglobulin that binds to a protein of interest. An indirect ELISA may be used for this purpose. In brief, the supernatants of hybridomas are incubated in microtiter wells that contain immobilized protein. After washing, the titer of bound immunoglobulin can be determined using, for example, a goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. After additional washing, the amount of immobilized enzyme is determined (for example through the use of a chromogenic substrate). Such screening is performed as quickly as possible after the identification of the hybridoma in order to ensure that a desired clone is not overgrown by non-secreting neighbor cells. Desirably, the fusion plates are screened several times since the rates of hybridoma growth vary. In a preferred sub-embodiment, a different antigenic form may be used to screen the hybridoma. Thus, for example, the splenocytes may be immunized with one immunogen, but the resulting hybridomas can be screened using a different immunogen. It is understood that any of the protein or peptide molecules of the present invention may be used to raise antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0321" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0321&rsqb;</number> Such antibody molecules or their fragments may be used for diagnostic purposes. Where the antibodies are intended for diagnostic purposes, it may be desirable to derivatize them, for example with a ligand group (such as biotin) or a detectable marker group (such as a fluorescent group, a radioisotope or an enzyme). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0322" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0322&rsqb;</number> The ability to produce antibodies that bind the protein or peptide molecules of the present invention permits the identification of mimetic compounds of those molecules. A &ldquo;mimetic compound&rdquo; is a compound that is not that compound, or a fragment of that compound, but which nonetheless exhibits an ability to specifically bind to antibodies directed against that compound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0323" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0323&rsqb;</number> Having now generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood through reference to the following examples which are provided by way of illustration, and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention, unless specified. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0339" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0339&rsqb;</number> The physical mapping of a QTL (quantitative trait locus) is described in this example. Mapping is initiated with linkage analysis of SSR (simple sequence repeats) markers. Markers that are shown to be linked to the QTL of interest are used to PCR screen the soy BAC library and identify candidate BACs. Confirmed BACs are subcloned and sequenced, BAC-end sequenced, and fingerprinted. New markers are designed from good BAC-end sequences and used to screen the library, by either PCR or hybridization to high density grid filters, in order to extend the contigs. A BAC-end sequence and fingerprint database of soy BACs is used in conjunction with the above methods to help build and extend contigs. Sequenced BACs are aligned, and overlapping BACs are placed into contigs. These contigs, which contain unique sequences, are put into an ACEDB database, and predicted genes are annotated by hand using various programs. Candidates genes (for the gene of interest) are subdloned from genomic DNA of different lines by PCR using primers from outside the predicted coding regions. These subclones are sequenced and screened for SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and INDELs (insertions/deletions), and different haplotypes of the lines with and without the desired phenotype are examined for correlations between the haplotype and phenotype. </paragraph>

Isolated DNA fragments are excised and gel-purified using the Clonetech NucleoSpin gel extraction kit (Clonetech Laboratories Inc., 1020 East Meadow Circle, Palo Alto, Calif.), before labeling. In order to check the size of the fragments and concentration, 2 tl of eluted DNA plus loading buffer are loaded on a 1% agarose gel along with DNA markers of known concentration and size. All the probes used to screen the library are tested individually for repetitiveness, with a smaller filter spotted with random clones from the library along with some positive control clones according to the protocol described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0350" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0350&rsqb;</number> The A3244 soy library generated by a an EcoRI digest is spotted on 3 high density grid filters from Research Genetics (Research Genetics, 2130 Memorial Parkway, Huntsville, Ala.). Each filter has six fields, twelve 384 well plates are spotted in each field in duplicate, with a total of 27,648 clones spotted on each filter. The plates are spotted in a 5&times;5 grid (12 clones per 5&times;5 grid) pattern within each field. Each clone is spotted in duplicate with a specific orientation within the 5&times;5 grid, which, together with the field position, gives information about its address. In a first round hybridization procedure, multiple probes are labeled separately and then pooled together to hybridize to BAC filters. Positive BACs identified in this procedure are deconvoluted by rehybridization with the individual probes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0351" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0351&rsqb;</number> A hybridization oven is set at 65&deg; C., and Church Buffer (0.5 M Sodium Phosphate, pH 7.0, 7% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mM EDTA, 100 &mgr;g/ml salmon sperm DNA) is prewarmed to 65&deg; C. Membranes are washed in 500 ml of 0.1&times; SSC, 0.1% SDS in a large container at room temperature for 5 minutes with gentle shaking (50 rpm) on a rotary shaker. The membranes are rinsed with 500 ml of 0.1&times; SSC (no SDS) for 1 minute. The wash solution is poured off, and 500 ml of 6&times; SSC (no SDS) is added to equilibrate the membranes. Three filters are placed in a tube. The filters are separated from each other and the sides of the tube by a layer of mesh. Each tube is filled with 6&times; SSC and shaken gently with the tube vertical to help eliminate bubbles between the filters and tube wall. The 6&times; SSC solution is poured off, and 25 ml of pre-warmed Church buffer is added. The bottles are rotated in a hybridization oven at 60 rpm and 65&deg; C. for 30 minutes or longer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0352" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0352&rsqb;</number> Probes are labeled using 1 &mgr;l of 40-50 uCi/&mgr;l &lsqb;&agr;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P dCTP&rsqb;, 50 ng of purified DNA in 49 &mgr;l of ddH2O, and Read-To-Go Labeling Beads from Amersham Pharmacia according to the manufacturers instructions (Amersham Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The probes are purified using the Bio-Spin Column P30 from BioRad according to manufacturers instructions (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 3316 Spring Garden Street, Philadelphia, Pa.). To 1 &mgr;l of the column-purified probe is added to a minipoly-Q vial (liquid scintillation vial) for each probe. 5 ml of scintillation liquid is added to each vial, and radiation activity for each vial is measured using a liquid scintillation counter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0353" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0353&rsqb;</number> After the probes are purified and counted for radioactivity, 10-20 probes and one control probe (from 50 &mgr;l reaction) are pooled with 10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>cpm/probe each, into one 1.5 ml eppendorf tube. The pooled probes are denatured at 99&deg; C. in a sand heating block for 10 minutes. The tubes are cooled on ice or ice water about 2 minutes, and then spun down at 14,000 rpm for 30 seconds in microcentrifuge. The tubes are pre-hybridized in 25 ml of Church buffer for at least 30 minutes, which is then poured off. 40 ml of fresh hybridization solution (pre-warmed Church buffer) is added. The pooled-probe solution is added to the hybridization tube. The tube is rotated in the hybridization oven at 60 rpm, 65&deg; C. overnight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> The probe solution is poured off, 30 ml of pre-warmed (65&deg; C.) 1&times; SSC, 0.1% SDS washing solution is added to the hybridization tube, the hybridization tube is rotated in the hybridization oven (at 65&deg; C.) for 15 minutes, and the process is repeat two times. At the last wash, the tube is rotated 1800 and at the same speed for 15 minutes at 65&deg; C. The washing solution is poured off, and 2&times; SSC (no SDS) is added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> Excess liquid is removed from each filter by placing the filter on a piece of 3MM paper. 4;5 The washed filter is placed on developed film with the DNA-side up (the side BACs were spotted on), covered with Saran wrap, and squeezed to force out liquid and bubbles. The Saran wrap is folded to the other side of the film, fixed it with tape, and then dried Kimwipes. The wrapped filters are placed into a film cassette with the DNA-side up (the side BACs were spotted on), which is placed on BioMax MS film (Biomax Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada) in a darkroom, and exposed overnight at room temperature without an intensifying screen. Film is developed with a film developer in the dark room the next day, and each film is labeled with filter number, probe used for hybridization, exposure time, and date. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> Starting from Field 3, a 384-well grid is put on the field with the Al position of the grid on the upper right, and the grid is aligned to the image. The row and column position for each positive clone on the BAC recording spreadsheet is determined and recorded. The pattern of the hybridization signal is matched to known patterns. There are 6 plate reference numbers for each of twelve patterns, which are arranged in the same manner as the 6 fields. Based on the signal pattern and field number, a plate reference number is determined for each positive clone. The grid is moved to the next field and the process is repeated. The original plate number (P) is determined using the following formula: P&equals;(N&minus;1)&times;72&plus;R, where N is the filter number on which the identified clone is present and R is the plate reference number previously determined. The complete address of the identified clone is given by the original plate number plus its position on the plate determined previously. BACs&apos; addresses are identified and converted to &ldquo;imp&rdquo; files according to a Q-bot file format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> 24 working plates are loaded into a Q-bot (Genetix, Queensway, New Milton, Hampshire, United Kingdom) 6-high hotel and media-filled 96-well plates are placed on the deck. The Q-bot is run following the standard manual using the program called &ldquo;Rearraying98&rdquo; with the settings given in Appendix III of the accompanying manual: BAC-Picking. Plates containing picked clones are placed in a shaker incubator and grown overnight at 37&deg; C. at 200 rpm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0358" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0358&rsqb;</number> 35 &mgr;l DNA solution are transferred from 96-well plates into a 384-well plate using a Platemate such that 4 96-well plates of DNA are combined into one 384-well plate. The 384-pin head (puck) is washed in 10% SDS solution for 5 minutes, ultrasonicated in a water bath for 3 minutes, washed with 70% ethanol for 1 min., and air dried for 3 minutes. The 384-well DNA source plates and membranes are arranged on the deck according to the instruction from the manual and the spotted grid design chosen for the membrane. Spotting pattern are designed so that there is one control probe at each of the 4 corners of the membrane. An asymmetric pattern is used to orient filters. The control probe concentration is about 5 ng/ul. Zeus is run according to instructions. If the DNA concentration is lower than 5 ng/ul, the Zeus is run a second time to double the amount of spotted DNA on the membrane. One of the empty spots is spot dyed, if available, using one 384-well dye plate. If an empty spot is not available, it is printed on one of the DNA spots. This spot marks the position for cutting filters into small membranes (9&times;12 cm). Membranes are interleaved between 3M papers and left to air-dry. Each corner of each membrane is marked with a permanent marker and numbered. Filters are denatured on the surface of 3M paper soaked with denaturalization solution for 4 minutes, and then neutralized on the surface of 3 M paper soaked with neutralization solution for 5 minutes. The filters are washed with 2&times; SSC for 5 minutes and then air dried. The filters are then baked at 80&deg; C. for 1 hr. and cut into individual small membranes (9&times;12 cm) according to the marked corner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> To confirm and deconvolute, hybridizations are done as before, but with newly generated filters, and each probe is done separately with a single filter using the smaller tube. 15 ml of Church buffer is used for the hybridization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0360&rsqb;</number> Fingerprints are generated by digesting the BAC DNA with Hind III for 3 hours at 37&deg; C. and running the reaction on a 0.8% gel at 200V for 19 hours. The gels are stained with SybrGreen, while shaking at room temperature for 45 minutes, and scanned with a Flourimager. The bands are sized using Frag software and the fingerprints are assembled into contigs within FPC. Every time new clones are added the contigs are rebuilt using a tolerance of 10 and a cutoff of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;9</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> Subclones are generated and Sanger sequencing reactions were performed on randomly chosen subclones using BigDye Terminators (Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, Calif.) then analyzed on ABI 377/ABI 3700 automated sequencing machines (Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, Calif.). 7-8 fold sequence coverage is thereby generated across the BAC. The sequences are evaluated for quality and error probability using the program, phred, assembled using the phrap assembler, and viewed using consed, as in example 2. For Bermuda standard BACs, all contigs are ordered and oriented and all gaps are closed using a directed primer walking strategy. A final quality value of phred40 (1 base error in 10,000 bases) with no gap regions, double coverage or two chemistries across single stranded areas is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> The sequence contigs are put into an ACEDB database along with soy EST and plant EST matches, along with Blastx, Tblastx, and Plant Blastn hits. Genemark.hmm is used to predict possible genes, and GeneFinder is used to predict splicing sites, ORFs, potential coding regions, as well as start and stop codons. The contigs are then annotated by hand and predicted genes accepted, edited, and modified based on the characteristics present in the sequence and matches to protein, nucleotide, and EST databases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> The high-density BAC library membranes used for hybridization are made by Research Genetics (Research Genetics, 2130 Memorial Parkway, Huntsville, Ala.), using a modified Q-bot (Genetix, Queensway, New Milton, Hampshire, United Kingdom), 384-well plates containing BACs are spotted onto 22 cm&times;22 cm Hybond N&plus;membranes (Amersham Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Bacteria from 72 plates are spotted twice onto one membrane, giving 55,296 colonies in total, or 27,648 unique clones per membrane. The plates are spotted into six &ldquo;fields&rdquo; per membrane, with each field having 12 plates spotted in duplicate. This spotting format results in six fields with 384 grids in each field. Each grid is a 5&times;5 matrix containing 12 unique clones in duplicate, with the center position left empty. The two positions occupied by each clone in duplicate are designed to give a unique pattern that indicates the plate location of each clone. After spotting, the bacteria on the membrane are incubated for 8 hours on LB-agar plates containing 12.5 ug/ml chloramphenicol. The membranes are then denatured, neutralized, washed in a standard procedure, UV-light crosslinked, and air-dried. The membranes can be stored and shipped at room temperature. </paragraph>
