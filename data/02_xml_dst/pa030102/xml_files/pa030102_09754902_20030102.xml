<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to telecommunication systems and, particularly, to a system that is more robust against in-band interferers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Typical direct sequence spread spectrum cordless telephone systems use a single conversion radio receiver. Such a receiver is illustrated more particularly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an antenna <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, a band-pass filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a mixer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a voltage-controlled oscillator <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, a band-pass filter <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, a demodulator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a low-pass filter <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and a synchronization block <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A modulated signal is received at the antenna <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and is band-pass filtered by the band-pass filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The band-pass filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> reduces the receiving signal bandwidth to the bandwidth that covers all the used channels. By doing so, the band-pass filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> filters out the out-of-band interference. The signal output from the band-pass filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is mixed in the mixer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a lower constant frequency signal which may be generated, as shown, by the voltage controlled oscillator <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The modulated receive signal is thus transferred down to a lower frequency, typically referred to as the Intermediate Frequency (IF). The band-pass filter <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is provided behind the mixer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> because the output of the mixer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is two down-converted modulated receive signals on two different frequencies, only one of which can be used in the demodulator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Thus, only one of the down-converted IF signals is passed through the band-pass filter <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to the demodulator <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The demodulator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> converts the frequency-modulated signal into a baseband signal, which is low-pass filtered using the low-pass filter <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Finally, the sync block <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> synchronizes to the low-pass filtered signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Such single conversion receivers may be disadvantageous in that a relatively large bandwidth is required for the band pass filter <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. More particularly, the bandwidth of the filter <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> must be at least twice the bandwidth of the system&apos;s frequency deviation. Typically, the frequency deviation is &plus;/&minus;f. That is, if a logical 0 is received, the receive frequency is &plus;f. If a logical 1 is received, the receive frequency is &minus;f. The bandpass filter bandwidth must therefore be 2 f. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Because of this relatively high bandwidth, the system is not robust against interferers at the carrier frequency, which can result in low performance against in band interferers. Moreover, the band pass filter is typically implemented as a relatively expensive surface acoustic wave filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An alternative to the single conversion receiver is a frequency downconversion receiver, in which the sync block modulates the voltage controlled oscillator. Such receivers are relatively more robust against in band interferers. However, such receivers are disadvantageous in that the sync block must predict the incoming signaling, i.e., implement some kind of predictive filtering, in order to synchronize to it. Often, this can be difficult or impossible. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> These and other problems in the prior art are overcome in large part by a system and method according to the present invention. A frequency downconversion receiver is provided that does not require predictive filtering for signal acquisition and synchronization. A sync block modulates a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with twice the frequency of the incoming rmodulated receive signal. From this, the bit position of the incoming data can be determined.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> illustrate a telecommunications system including telecommunications devices according to an implementation of the present invention. A frequency downconversion receiver is provided that does not require predictive filtering for signal acquisition and synchronization. A sync block modulates a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with twice the frequency of the incoming rmodulated receive signal. From this, the bit position of the incoming data can be determined. The value of the incoming data can be determined from whether the VCO output and the demodulator output have consecutive predetermined values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagram of an exemplary receiver in accordance with an implementation of the present invention. The receiver <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes an antenna <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, a band-pass filter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, a mixer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, a voltage-controlled oscillator <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, a low-pass filter <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, a demodulator <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, a low-pass filter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, and a synchronization block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A modulated signal is received at the antenna <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and is band-pass filtered by the band-pass filter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The band-pass filter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> reduces the receiving signal bandwidth to the bandwidth that covers only the channel currently in use, responsive to the frequency select signal. By doing so, the band-pass filter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> filters out the out-of-band interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The signal output from the band-pass filter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is mixed in the mixer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> with a lower constant frequency signal which may be generated, as shown, by the voltage controlled oscillator <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The voltage-controlled oscillator is modulated by the sync block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, as will be explained in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The modulated receive signal is thus transferred down to the Intermediate Frequency (IF). The use of frequency downconversion allows use of a low-pass filter <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> rather than the band pass filter <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Such a low-pass filter is relatively easier and less expensive to implement than the band-pass filter of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The down-converted IF signal is passed through the low-pass filter <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> to the demodulator <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The demodulator <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> converts the frequency-modulated signal into a baseband signal, which is low-pass filtered using the low-pass filter <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Finally, the sync block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> synchronizes to the low-pass filtered signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As will be explained in greater detail below, a receive signal carrier <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is input to the band pass filter <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>; a VCO carrier signal <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is input to the VCO <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>; and a signal <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is output from the demodulator <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The sync block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> reads the output of the demodulator <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and generates the signal driving the VCO <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. From these, the sync block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> can determine the receive signal bit positions and values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the relationships between these signals <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. The incoming data <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> on the antenna <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> are modulated digital data with logical levels of 0 and 1, modulated about the carrier frequency by &plus;/&minus;f. The sync block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> generates an alternating 1-0-1-0 pattern <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, which is used to drive the VCO <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. If this pattern is generated with twice the data rate of the to be received signal <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, then every received bit will be received at a half bit length at the same VCO frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The signal <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is the incoming receive (RX) signal received at the antenna <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. It is the carrier modulated by &plus;/&minus;f. The signal <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is the VCO frequency that is driven by the sync block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. It has twice the bit rate of the receive signal <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and is modulated around the same carrier by &plus;/&minus;f. The signal <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is the output of the demodulator <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. If the receive signal <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and the VCO signal <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are at the same frequency, then the output of the demodulator <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is one. If they are on different frequencies, the output is zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> If the output <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> of the demodulator <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is the same over two half periods T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, then the middle of the receive signal bit is at the beginning of the first VCO bit and at the end of the second VCO bit. This information is used to determine the bit position of the receive data stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Once the bit position has been determined, the sync block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> checks to determine if the output of the demodulator <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> was high when the VCO was high. If so, then the incoming receive bit was high. If the demodulator was high at VCO low, then the incoming receive bit was low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In operation, a receive signal is received, including initially a synchronization pattern. The sync block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> reads the demodulator <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>&apos;s output and drives the VCO <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. The sync block then reads the demodulator output to determine if the demodulator output has the same value for two time periods to find the bit position of the incoming signal. Then, the values of the incoming data are determined and output. The sync block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> thus includes circuitry adapted to read the demodulator signal, adjust the modulation of the VCO <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, e.g., adjusting the delay or relative position of the VCO signal, and compare the demodulator signal with the VCO signal to determine the output signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the sync block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The sync block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> includes a signal acquisition compare module (SACM) <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, a receive signal compare module (RCM) <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, and a VCO control module <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. The signal acquisition compare module <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> contains circuitry operable to receive the incoming demodulated signal and the values are the same over consecutive time periods. The signal acquisition compare module <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is further operable to control the output of the VCO control module <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, which adjusts the delay of the VCO signal until the signal acquisition compare module detects consecutive same values. The receive compare module <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> receives both the demodulator output and the VCO carrier. As noted above, if the output of the demodulator <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> was high when the VCO was high, then the incoming receive bit was high. If the demodulator was high at VCO low, then the incoming receive bit was low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The various components of the sync block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may be implemented as one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICS) or may be implemented as various combinations of executable software code running on one or more on-chip or discrete processors, and associated storage devices, such as random access memory, read only memory, or mass storage such as a magnetic disk drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Operation of an implementation of the present invention is illustrated more particularly with reference to the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In a step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, the receiver receives the incoming signal <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and in step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, the VCO control generates the VCO control signaling. In a step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, the signal acquisition compare module <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> reads the demodulated signal to determine if two consecutive bits are the same. If not, then the VCO control module adjusts the delay in step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. If so, then in step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, the receive compare module <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> compares the VCO and demodulator signals. If the signals are both 1, as determined in step <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, then in step <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, the receive compare module <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> outputs a 1 for the sync block <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. If not, then the receive compare module <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> determines if the signals are both 0, in step <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>. If so, then a 0 is output, in step <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the system cycles back to compare the signals. Next, in step <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, if the signal stream ends, then the process stops. Otherwise, the system cycles back to step <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> to keep comparing the received, synchronized bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It is noted that, while described above with reference to a direct sequence spread spectrum system, the invention is also suited for use in frequency hopping spread spectrum systems, such as those employing the DECT or WDCT standards. The invention described in the above detailed description is not intended to be limited to the specific form set forth herein, but is intended to cover such alternatives, modifications and equivalents as can reasonably be included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
