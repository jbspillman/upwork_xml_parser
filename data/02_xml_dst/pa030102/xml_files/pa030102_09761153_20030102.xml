<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a device and method for detecting the existence of a flow of gas into or out of an opening, more particularly, but not exclusively, the breathing of a subject. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> One of the conventional methods of rapidly determining whether an unconscious person is alive is to check for the existance of breathing. At times this may be done under hospital conditions. At other times, such as at the site of armed conflicts, disasters or accidents, it must be done in the field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Direct detection of breathing is unreliable because the respiration of an injured or ill person may be sporadic, irregular or so subtle as to be nearly imperceptible. Accordingly, medical science abounds with complex technology that detects, monitors and measures respiration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are many devices commonly in practice. One device used to detect breathing is a thermistor or thermocouple placed in or near the patient&apos;s airway so that the patient&apos;s breath passes over the temperature sensing device. Breathing gas entering the patient has a temperature that is generally lower than the exhaled gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A second device for measuring the airflow to and from a patient is a pneumotach sensor placed between a supply of breathing gas and the patient&apos;s airway. The pneumotach provides a known resistance to the flow. The patient&apos;s breathing capacity may increase the resistance, which is measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A third type of airflow meter is a nasal cannula meter which includes a pair of ports that insert into the nares of the patient. A hollow tubing carries a fraction of the total amount of breathing gas to a sensor. If the total area of the patient&apos;s nares relative to the total area of the ports is known, the meter can provide a quantitative measure of the patient&apos;s airflow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A fourth method uses a microphone or pressure sensor mounted on the exterior of the patient&apos;s neck to detect sounds or throat vibrations generated by respiration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A fifth method is to convert air flow to an oscillatory wave signal and measure its amplitude. See, for example, devices recently taught by Berthon Jones in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,704,345, 6,029,665 and 6,138,675. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Other devices found for monitoring or measuring breathing include those in which the air flow mechanically rotates a propeller, displaces a vane, causes rotation of a tube or moves a ball within a tube, each of which is measured and provides an indication of the respiratory function of the subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Prior art reflects many devices for monitoring breathing that rely on pressure measurement to evaluate respiratory function. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,970,801, Ciobanu, et al disclose a variable orifice flow sensor that measures air flow by use of a hinged flapper which deflects as a result of air flow and triggers pressure sensing taps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Starr et al, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,017,315, shows a monitor for measuring respiration that uses a pressure sensitive sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No. 5,052,400, Dietz discloses a method and apparatus that detects breathing by means of a pressure capacitance transducer that develops pressure variations in response to breathing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Riker, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,170,798, teaches a pulmonary function tester that uses a pressure transducer in the mouthpiece to measure ambient pressure prior to and after sensing the pressure created by a patient&apos;s pulmonary function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from the above, all of the devices in use for monitoring breathing do more than merely indicate the existence of respiration. Rather, each of them uses a complex sensing device to detect, monitor or measure respiration. Moreover, all of the devices and methods referred to above require complex and expensive machinery that is typically found only in medical facilities. Such devices are not customarily brought into the field and most certainly not to remote or rugged sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> There does not exist a simple and portable mechanical device that reliably detects and displays the existence of breathing, particularly at very low levels, without relying upon relatively complex technology to do so. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in this application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is applicable to other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the invention provides a device and method for detecting the existence of a flow of gas into or out of an opening. The device is particularly useful for detecting the breathing of a subject and is therefore described in that context below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Reference is made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> which is a simplified diagram showing a perspective view of a device constructed in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention comprising three main elements: an inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and a pressure displaceable member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> communicates fluidly with the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The pressure displaceable member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is exposed on its inner face to the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is further in fluid communication with an outlet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which may have the same flow capacity as the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or may be configured so as to restrict the flow of a gas to a greater degree than the flow is restricted by the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The difference in the flow capacities between the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the outlet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> influences the sensitivity of the device, The greater the difference, the greater the sensitivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a protective casing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which encompasses the pressure displaceable member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and which contains holes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> therein in order to expose the outer face of the pressure displaceable member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to the ambient pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a section view of the device configured with the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in communication with the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which in turn communicates with the ambient pressure via the outlet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. It will be noted that in the preferred embodiment of the invention, the outlet is narrowed so as to have a smaller internal diameter than the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, thus restricting the flow capacity therethrough to be less than that of the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that the outlet may be configured in other manners so as to cause a restriction of the gas flow therethrough, such as by the insertion of baffles in the flow path or by having an irregular rather than a smooth interior wall. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> depicts the outlet having a ribbed interior wall, restricting the flow capacity therethrough as a result of turbulence caused by the flow passing over the irregular surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the outlet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be configured to restrict the flow of gas to the same degree that the flow of gas is restricted by the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. This configuration may be preferable if the device is to remain applied to a subject for a protacted period of time in order to monitor the subject&apos;s breathing without causing an impediment to such breathing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The pressure displaceable member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> forms a part of the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, having its inner face exposed to the pressure within the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and its outer face exposed to the ambient pressure. Removeably attached to the pressure displaceable member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a visual indicator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> comprising two component parts, a moveable element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a scale <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The moveable element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is removably attached to the pressure displaceable member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in a hinged manner by a flexible strip <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The visual indicator is useful for obtaining an indication of the respiratory volume of the subject. The movement of the moveable element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is restricted by a spring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. If different degrees of restriction are needed for different applications, the tension of the spring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> may be adjusted or springs of different tensions may be used. The device may be used without the spring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Attached to the moveable element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> that detects the displacement of the pressure displaceable member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and is capable of transmitting a signal indicating such displacement to a remote reciever. The pressure displaceable member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, along with the visual indicator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> are enclosed within a protective casing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which has holes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> therein in order to expose the pressure displaceable member to the ambient pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts the device from the top down, illustrating the configuration of the outlet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> narrowed as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a simplified diagram showing a front view of the device with an attaching member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> adapted to associate with a circular shaped opening in an object that is to be tested for the inflow or outflow of gas. The attaching member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is circular in shape with an outside diameter diminishing in size from its proximal end to its distal end so that it may be inserted into the circular shaped opening until its increasing diameter can no longer enter the opening but rather forms a pressurewise seal within the opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a section view depicting the device with an attaching member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> adapted to associate with the mouth and nose of a person. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A device constructed In accordance with the preferred embodiment works on the principle of pressure differential. Detection of gas flow is based on the existence of a difference between a pressure within the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which is in communication with the opening being tested, and the ambient pressure outside the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The attaching member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the device, which bears the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, is applied to the opening to be tested. In the described preferred embodiment, the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has a greater flow capacity than the outlet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the inflow or outflow of gas, which passes freely through the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> but is restricted by the outlet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, causes a difference in the pressure within the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> relative to the pressure outside the chamber. If gas is flowing into the opening, the restricted flow of the outlet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> relative to the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will cause reduced pressure within the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. If gas is flowing out of the opening, the restricted flow of the outlet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> relative to the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> will cause increased pressure within the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This pressure differential continues as long as the flow of gas continues. If the flow stops, the pressure quickly equalizes, as the interior of the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with the ambient pressure outside of the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> via the outlet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The pressure displaceable member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the preferred embodiment of the device is a flexible bellows shaped membrane that is easily deflected. One side of the membrane is exposed to the interior of the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the other side of the membrane is exposed to the ambient pressure. Accordingly, reduced pressure within the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> causes the membrane to deflect inwards toward the interior of the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Increased pressure within the chamber causes the membrane to deflect outwards toward the exterior of the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. When the membrane is subject to equal pressure on both of its sides, it does not deflect in either direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the difference in pressure between the interior of the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the ambient pressure will be influenced by the magnitude of the difference between the rate of flow via the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and via the outlet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Given the same rate of flow, if the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the outlet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are restricted to the same degree, the difference in pressure between the interior of the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the ambient pressure will be less and of shorter duration than if the outlet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is restricted to a greater degree than the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the sensitivity of the device can be adjusted by increasing or decreasing the difference in the flow capacities between the inlet <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the outlet <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The pressure displaceable member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is coupled to a visual indicator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The visual indicator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> comprises a movable element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>which in the described preferred embodiment is configured as a hinged plate, and an adjacent scale <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The displacement of the pressure displaceable member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is directly communicated to the visual indicator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, thereby enhancing its visibility. Moreover, the displacement of the movable element <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>registers on the adjacent scale <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>providing a rudimentary means ofjudging the magnitude of the gas flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> There is provided a means of applying resistance to the movement of the visual indicator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> in order to test for the existance of a flow of a certain desired magnitude. A calibrated spring <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of predetermined tension is used to adjust the resistance of the visual indicator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A displacement sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be attached to the visual indicator for the purpose of increasing the perceptibility of the movement of the pressure displaceable member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The sensor <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be of the type that emits a visual, audible or tactile signal or that transmits a signal to a remote receptor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The pressure displaceable member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, being fragile, is enclosed by a casing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which protects it from inadvertant manipulation or injury. The casing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> contains holes <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> therein so that the outer face of the pressure displaceable member <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is exposed to the ambient pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> While the illustrated embodiments depict the device as having an attaching member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> configured as a circular plug for engaging a circular hole in an object (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), or as a face mask adapted to be applied to the mouth and nose of a subject (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to these particular applications. On the contrary, the present invention contemplates that the attaching member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be adapted to any opening into which or out of which a gas may flow. The attaching member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may have any shape, pattern, form or configuration so long as it communicates the interior of the chamber <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to the opening being tested. The invention may therefore be adapted to detect gas flow from openings in surfaces, in objects, or along the length or at the end of tubes, hoses and pipes and from holes, cracks, ruptures, apertures or breaches of any size or shape. The device may be employed by being held in a stationary position or by being moved over the surface of an object such as a pipe in order to scan for leaks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the device is not defined by a fixed size. On the contrary, devices of different sizes will be required for different applications. It is believed that one practiced in the art will be capable of so adapting the present invention to any application that includes an opening that emits or intakes a gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It is appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention which are, for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment, may also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited to what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove. Rather, the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and includes both combinations and subcombinations of the various features described hereinabove as well as variations and modifications thereof which would occur to persons skilled in the art upon reading the foregoing description. </paragraph>
