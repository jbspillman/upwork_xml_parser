<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to chemical mechanical polishing of substrates, and more particularly to methods and apparatus for detecting an end-point of a metal layer during a chemical mechanical polishing operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An integrated circuit is typically formed on a substrate by the sequential deposition of conductive, semiconductive or insulative layers on a silicon wafer. After each layer is deposited, the layer is etched to create circuitry features. As a series of layers are sequentially deposited and etched, the outer or uppermost surface of the substrate, i.e., the exposed surface of the substrate, becomes increasingly non-planar. This non-planar surface presents problems in the photolithographic steps of the integrated circuit fabrication process. Therefore, there is a need to periodically planarize the substrate surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is one accepted method of planarization. This planarization method typically requires that the substrate be mounted on a carrier or polishing head. The exposed surface of the substrate is placed against a rotating polishing pad. The polishing pad may be either a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; pad or a fixed-abrasive pad. A standard pad has a durable roughened surface, whereas a fixed-abrasive pad has abrasive particles held in a containment media. The carrier head provides a controllable load, i.e., pressure, on the substrate to push it against the polishing pad. A polishing slurry, including at least one chemically-reactive agent, and abrasive particles if a standard pad is used, is supplied to the surface of the polishing pad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One problem in CMP is determining whether the polishing process is complete, i.e., whether a substrate layer has been planarized to a desired flatness or thickness. Variations in the initial thickness of the substrate layer, the slurry composition, the polishing pad condition, the relative speed between the polishing pad and the substrate, and the load on the substrate can cause variations in the material removal rate. These variations cause variations in the time needed to reach the polishing endpoint. Therefore, the polishing endpoint cannot be determined merely as a function of polishing time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One way to determine the polishing endpoint is to remove the substrate from the polishing surface and examine it. For example, the substrate may be transferred to a metrology station where the thickness of a substrate layer is measured, e.g., with a profilometer or a resistivity measurement. If the desired specifications are not met, the substrate is reloaded into the CMP apparatus for further processing. This is a time consuming procedure that reduces the throughput of the CMP apparatus. Alternatively, the examination might reveal that an excessive amount of material has been removed, rendering the substrate unusable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Several methods have been developed for in-situ polishing endpoint detection. Most of these methods involve monitoring a parameter associated with the substrate surface, and indicating an endpoint when the parameter abruptly changes. For example, where an insulative or dielectric layer is being polished to expose an underlying metal layer, the coefficient of friction and the reflectivity of the substrate will change abruptly when the metal layer is exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Where the monitored parameter changes abruptly at the polishing endpoint, such endpoint detection methods are acceptable. However, as the substrate is being polished, the polishing pad condition and the slurry composition at the pad-substrate interface may change. Such changes may mask the exposure of an underlying layer, or they may imitate an endpoint condition. Additionally, such endpoint detection methods will not work if only planarization is being performed, if the underlying layer is to be over-polished, or if the underlying layer and the overlying layer have similar physical properties. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the invention is directed to a method of polishing a substrate. A first layer of a substrate is chemical mechanical polished with a first polishing fluid. The substrate has a second layer disposed under the first layer, and the first and second layers have differing reflectivity. The substrate is optically monitored during polishing with the first polishing slurry to generate plurality of intensity traces. Each intensity trace includes intensity measurements from a different radial range on the substrate. Once any of the intensity traces indicates an initial clearance of the first layer, the substrate is chemical mechanical polished with a second polishing fluid having different polishing properties than the first polishing fluid. Optical monitoring of the substrate continues during polishing with the second polishing slurry, and polishing is halted after all the intensity traces indicate that the second layer has been completely exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Implementations of the invention may include one or more of the following features. Optical monitoring may include directing a light beam through a window in a polishing surface and causing the light beam to move in a path across the substrate, monitoring a reflectance signal produced by the light beam reflecting off the substrate, and extracting a plurality of intensity measurements from the reflectance signal. Generating the plurality of intensity traces may include sorting each intensity measurement into one of the radial ranges according to a position of the light beam during the intensity measurement and determining the intensity trace from the intensity measurements associated with the radial range. The first slurry may be a high-selectivity slurry and the second slurry may be a low-selectivity slurry. The first layer may be more reflective than the second layer. The first layer may be a metal layer, such as copper. The second layer may be an oxide layer, such as silicon dioxide, or a barrier layer, such as tantalum or tantalum nitride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention is directed to a method of polishing a substrate in which a surface of a substrate is brought into contact with a polishing surface that has a window. The substrate has a first layer disposed over a second layer, and the first and second layers have differing reflectivity. A first slurry is supplied to the substrate for a first polishing step, and relative motion is caused between the substrate and the polishing surface. A light beam is directed through the window, and the motion of the polishing surface relative to the substrate causes the light beam to move in a path across the substrate. A reflectance signal produced by the light beam reflecting off the substrate is monitored, a plurality of intensity measurements are extracted from the reflectance signal, and a plurality of intensity traces are generated with each intensity trace including intensity measurements from a different radial range on the substrate. A second slurry is supplied to the substrate for a polishing second polishing step when any of the intensity traces indicates an initial clearance of the first layer. The second slurry has different polishing properties than the first slurry. Polishing is halted after all the intensity traces indicate that the second layer has been completely exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Implementations of the invention may include one or more of the following features. The first slurry may be a high-selectivity slurry and the second slurry may be a low-selectivity slurry. The second layer may be disposed over a third layer in the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention is directed to a method of polishing a substrate having a metal layer disposed over an oxide layer. In the method, a surface of a substrate is brought into contact with a polishing surface that has a window. A high-selectivity slurry is supplied to the polishing surface. Relative motion is caused between the substrate and the polishing surface. A light beam is directed through the window, and the motion of the polishing surface relative to the substrate causes the light beam to move in a path across the substrate. A reflectance signal produced by the light beam reflecting off the substrate is monitored, and a plurality of intensity measurements are extracted from the reflectance signal. A radial position is determined for each intensity measurement, and the plurality of intensity measurements are divided into a plurality of radial ranges according to the radial positions. A plurality of intensity traces are generated, with each intensity trace including intensity measurements from one of the plurality of radial ranges. A low-selectivity slurry is supplied to the polishing surface when any of the intensity traces indicates an initial clearance of the metal layer, and polishing is halted when all the intensity traces indicate that the oxide layer has been completely exposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Implementations of the invention may include one or more of the following features. A sudden drop in a reflectance trace may indicates initial clearance of the metal layer in the radial range associated with the reflectance trace. A flattening out of a reflectance trace may indicate exposure of the oxide layer in the radial range associated with the reflectance trace. The substrate may includes a barrier layer, e.g., tantalum or tantalum nitride, disposed between the metal layer, e.g., copper, and the oxide layer, e.g., silicon oxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Advantages of the invention include one or more of the following. A copper-coated substrate may be polished with reduced dishing and erosion. Both the polishing endpoint, and the point at which the polishing apparatus should switch from a high-selectivity slurry to a low-selectivity slurry may be accurately determined. Detailed data is available on the progress of the metal polishing operation at different locations of the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description, including the drawings and claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, one or more substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be polished by a CMP apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A description of a similar polishing apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,738,574, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Polishing apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a series of polishing stations <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a transfer station <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Transfer station <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> serves multiple functions, including receiving individual substrates <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from a loading apparatus (not shown), washing the substrates, loading the substrates into carrier heads, receiving the substrates from the carrier heads, washing the substrates again, and finally, transferring the substrates back to the loading apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Each polishing station includes a rotatable platen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on which is placed a polishing pad <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The first and second stations may include a two-layer polishing pad with a hard durable outer surface, whereas the final polishing station may include a relatively soft pad. If substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is an &ldquo;eight-inch&rdquo; (200 millimeter) or &ldquo;twelve-inch&rdquo; (300 millimeter) diameter disk, then the platens and polishing pads will be about twenty inches or thirty inches in diameter, respectively. Each platen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be connected to a platen drive motor (not shown). For most polishing processes, the platen drive motor rotates platen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at about thirty to two hundred revolutions per minute, although lower or higher rotational speeds may be used. Each polishing station may also include a pad conditioner apparatus <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to maintain the condition of the polishing pad so that it will effectively polish substrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Polishing pad <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> typically has a backing layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which abuts the surface of platen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a covering layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which is used to polish substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Covering layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is typically harder than backing layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. However, some pads have only a covering layer and no backing layer. Covering layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be composed of an open cell foamed polyurethane or a sheet of polyurethane with a grooved surface. Backing layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be composed of compressed felt fibers leached with urethane. A two-layer polishing pad, with the covering layer composed of IC-1000 and the backing layer composed of SUBA-4, is available from Rodel, Inc., of Newark, Del. (IC-1000 and SUBA-4 are product names of Rodel, Inc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A rotatable multi-head carousel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is supported by a center post <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and is rotated thereon about a carousel axis <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> by a carousel motor assembly (not shown). Center post <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> supports a carousel support plate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and a cover <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Carousel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes four carrier head systems <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Center post <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> allows the carousel motor to rotate carousel support plate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and to orbit the carrier head systems and the substrates attached thereto about carousel axis <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Three of the carrier head systems receive and hold substrates, and polish them by pressing them against the polishing pads. Meanwhile, one of the carrier head systems receives a substrate from and delivers a substrate to transfer station <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Each carrier head system includes a carrier or carrier head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. A carrier drive shaft <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> connects a carrier head rotation motor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (shown by the removal of one quarter of cover <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>) to each carrier head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> so that each carrier head can independently rotate about it own axis. There is one carrier drive shaft and motor for each head. In addition, each carrier head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> independently laterally oscillates in a radial slot <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> formed in carousel support plate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. A slider (not shown) supports each drive shaft in its associated radial slot. A radial drive motor (not shown) may move the slider to laterally oscillate the carrier head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The carrier head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> performs several mechanical functions. Generally, the carrier head holds the substrate against the polishing pad, evenly distributes a downward pressure across the back surface of the substrate, transfers torque from the drive shaft to the substrate, and ensures that the substrate does not slip out from beneath the carrier head during polishing operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Carrier head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may include a flexible membrane <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> that provides a mounting surface for substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a retaining ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to retain the substrate beneath the mounting surface. Pressurization of a chamber <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> defined by flexible membrane <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> forces the substrate against the polishing pad. Retaining ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may be formed of a highly reflective material, or it may be coated with a reflective layer to provide it with a reflective lower surface <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. A description of a similar carrier head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/745,679, entitled a CARRIER HEAD WITH a FLEXIBLE MEMBRANE FOR a CHEMICAL MECHANICAL POLISHING SYSTEM, filed Nov. 8, 1996, by Steven M. Zuniga et al., assigned to the assignee of the present invention, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A slurry <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> containing a reactive agent (e.g., deionized water for oxide polishing) and a chemically-reactive catalyzer (e.g., potassium hydroxide for oxide polishing) may be supplied to the surface of polishing pad <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by a slurry supply port or combined slurry/rinse arm <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. If polishing pad <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a standard pad, slurry <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may also include abrasive particles (e.g., silicon dioxide for oxide polishing). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In operation, the platen is rotated about its central axis <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and the carrier head is rotated about its central axis <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and translated laterally across the surface of the polishing pad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed in platen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a transparent window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is formed in a portion of polishing pad <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> overlying the hole. Transparent window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be constructed as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/689,930, entitled METHOD OF FORMING A TRANSPARENT WINDOW IN A POLISHING PAD FOR A CHEMICAL MECHANICAL POLISHING APPARATUS by Manoocher Birang, et al., filed Aug. 26, 1996, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and transparent window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are positioned such that they have a view of substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during a portion of the platen&apos;s rotation, regardless of the translational position of the carrier head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> A reflectometer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is secured to platen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> generally beneath hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and rotates with the platen. The reflectometer includes a light source <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a detector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The light source generates a light beam <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which propagates through transparent window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and slurry <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) to impinge upon the exposed surface of substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, the light source <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be laser and the light beam <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be a collimated laser beam. The light laser beam <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is projected from laser <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at an angle from an axis normal to the surface of substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, i.e., at an angle from axes <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. In addition, if the hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are elongated, a beam expander (not illustrated) may be positioned in the path of the light beam to expand the light beam along the elongated axis of the window. Laser <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may operate continuously. Alternatively, the laser may be activated to generate laser beam <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> during a time when hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is generally adjacent substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>E, CMP apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may include a position sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, such as an optical interrupter, to sense when window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is near the substrate. For example, the optical interrupter could be mounted at a fixed point opposite carrier head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. A flag <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is attached to the periphery of the platen. The point of attachment and length of flag <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> is selected so that it interrupts the optical signal of sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> from a time shortly before window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> sweeps beneath carrier head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to a time shortly thereafter. The output signal from detector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be measured and stored while the optical signal of sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is interrupted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In operation, CMP apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> uses reflectometer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to determine the amount of material removed from the surface of the substrate, or to determine when the surface has become planarized. A general purpose programmable digital computer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be connected to laser <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, detector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Computer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may be programmed to activate the laser when the substrate generally overlies the window, to store intensity measurements from the detector, to display the intensity measurements on an output device <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, to store the intensity measurement, to sort the intensity measurements into radial ranges, and to detect the polishing endpoint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a silicon wafer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and an overlying metal layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> disposed over an oxide or nitride layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The metal may be copper, tungsten, aluminum, among others. As different portions of the substrate with different reflectivities are polished, the signal output from the detector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> varies with time. Particularly, when the metal layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has been polished away to expose the oxide or nitride layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the reflectivity of the substrate drops. The time varying output of detector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be referred to as an in-situ reflectance measurement trace (or more simply, a reflectance trace). As discussed below, this reflectance trace may be used to determine the end-point of the metal layer polishing operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>E, a measured reflectance trace with a transient intensity waveform <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> generated by polishing a metal-coated wafer is shown. The intensity waveform <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is generated over a relatively long time scale (measured in seconds). Characteristic features of the waveform include top level plateau <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>, each of which is surrounded by left and right intermediate plateau <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. One cycle of the waveform <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> includes left and right intermediate level plateau <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, one of the top level plateau <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>, and a background level <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The intermediate plateau <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> represent reflections from the retaining ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, while the top level plateau <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> represent reflections from the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The background level represents scattered reflections from the window and slurry. The reflection from retaining ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is higher than background level. As the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is polished and the metal layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is removed to expose the underlying layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the end-point waveform <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> drops toward or below the level of the intermediate plateau <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>E, the large scale structure of reflectance trace <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can be explained by reference to the angular position of platen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Initially, window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> does not have view of the substrate (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>). Consequently, laser beam <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is not reflected and the intensity measured by detector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is a result of background intensity, including reflection from slurry <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and transparent window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. This low intensity corresponds to the background level <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. As platen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> rotates, window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> first sweeps underneath retaining ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of carrier head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>). The lower surface <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of retaining ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> reflects a portion of laser beam <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> into detector <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, creating an intermediate intensity measurement that corresponds to intermediate plateau <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. As window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> sweeps beneath substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference>) a portion of laser beam <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is reflected by the substrate. In general, the metal layer of substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will have a high reflectivity, resulting in top level plateau <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> on reflectance trace <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. As the platen continues to rotate, window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> passes again beneath retaining ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</cross-reference>). Finally, window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> sweeps out from beneath carrier head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</cross-reference>), and the detector measures a low intensity that corresponds to the background <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Computer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of CMP apparatus <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may use the reflectance trace generated by reflectometer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to determine the end-point of the metal layer polishing operation. Each measurement may be performed at a plurality of radial positions. In addition, computer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> may use the intensity measurements to determine the flatness of the substrate and the polishing uniformity for CMP tool and process qualification as explained below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, an end-point determining process is shown. First, several polishing parameters that will be used during the end-point determination are stored in the memory of computer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>). The polishing parameters of interest include the platen rotation rate and the carrier head sweep profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A metal layer on a surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is polished (step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) by bringing the surface of the substrate into contact with the polishing pad <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The polishing pad <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is rotated, causing relative motion between the substrate and the polishing pad. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Transient intensity data is monitored and collected for a plurality of sampling zones (step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). This is done by directing a light beam generated by the reflectometer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through the window. The motion of the polishing pad <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> relative to the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> causes the light beam to move in a path across the substrate surface. Light beam reflections from the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the retaining ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are detected by a sensor, which generates reflection data associated with the light beam reflections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The transient intensity data is displayed on a monitor (step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>) for an operator to monitor the progress of the polishing operation. A pattern recognizer is applied to the transient intensity data to detect signal changes (step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>). The pattern recognizer may simply be a threshold detector which checks whether the intensity data has fallen below a predetermined threshold. Alternatively, in another embodiment, a window logic can be applied to the data to detect a sequence of signal changes. Three types of window logic are used to detect local maxima and minima: a window logic with a downwardly cusp to detect a downward trend in the reflection data; a window logic with an upwardly cusp to detect an upward trend in the reflection data; and a window logic with a substantially flat line to detect that the reflection data is relatively static. The signal changes may be averaged. More discussion of pattern recognition algorithms for endpoint detection may be found in above mentioned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/689,930. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The output of the pattern recognizer is a stop signal which, along with additional feedback data, is provided to a polisher controller (step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). The polisher controller uses the feedback data to adjust various variables and parameters to minimize erosion and dishing of the surface layer. For instance, the polishing pressure, polishing speed, chemistry, and slurry composition may be deployed to optimize the overall polishing performance and/or polishing quality. The stop signal causes the polisher controller to stop the current metal layer polishing operation (step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Concurrent with steps <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> stores the transient intensity data onto a data storage device, e.g., a computer disk (step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>) for subsequent processing. In brief, the intensity for each sampling zone is determined (step <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>), the radial position of each sampling zone is calculated (step <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>), and the intensity measurements are sorted into radial ranges (step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>). The sorted intensity measurements are used to measure the polishing uniformity and removal rates at different radial ranges of the substrate (step <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>). Each of these steps will be discussed in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Generally, the reflected intensity changes during polishing for different radial positions on the substrate. The metal layer may be removed at different rates for different portions of the substrate. For instance, the metal layer near the center of the substrate may be removed last, while the metal layer near the perimeter or edge of the substrate may be removed first, or vice versa. The reflection data from the entire wafer is captured at a relatively fine time scale in the order of milliseconds and is available for experimentation to improve the deposition process. By analyzing the recorded data, the process can be changed to make it faster, shorter or smoother. As can be appreciated, the stored data is useful for process research and development to optimize the process performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference>, the combined rotation of the platen and the linear sweep of the carrier head causes window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> (and thus laser beam <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) to sweep across the bottom surface of carrier head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a sweep path <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As the laser beam sweeps across the substrate, reflectometer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> integrates the measured intensity over a sampling period, Tsample, to generate a series of individual intensity measurements Ia, Ib, . . . Ij. The sample rate F (the rate at which intensity measurements are generated) of reflectometer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is given by F&equals;1/Tsample. Reflectometer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may have a sample rate between about 10 and 400 Hertz (Hz), corresponding to a sampling period between about 2.5 and 100 milliseconds. Specifically, reflectometer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may have a sampling rate of about 40 Hz and a sampling period of about 25 milliseconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Thus, each time that laser <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is activated, reflectometer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> measures the intensity from a plurality of sampling zones <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>. Each sampling zone corresponds to the area of the substrate over which the laser beam sweeps during a corresponding sampling period. In summary, in step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, reflectometer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> generates a series of intensity measurements Ia, Ib, . . . Ij corresponding to sampling zones <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> illustrates ten sampling zones, there could be more or fewer zones, depending on the platen rotation rate and the sampling rate. Specifically, a lower sampling rate will result in fewer, wider sampling zones, whereas a higher sampling rate will result in a greater number of narrower sampling zones. Similarly, a lower rotation rate will result in a larger number of narrower sampling zones, whereas a higher rotation rate will result in a lower number of wider sampling zones. In addition, multiple detectors could be used to provide more sampling zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, the intensity measurements Ia and Ij for sampling zones <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>, respectively, are low because window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> does not have a view of the carrier head, and consequently laser beam <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is not reflected. Sampling zones <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>are located beneath retaining ring <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, and therefore intensity measurements Ib and Ii will be of intermediate intensity. Sampling zones <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>are located beneath the substrate, and consequently generate relatively large intensity measurements Ic, Id, . . . Ih at a variety of different radial positions across the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is an overlay of several transient signal graphs <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Each of the transient signal graphs <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> represents intensity data over an interval associated with a sweep of the window beneath the carrier head. For instance, the graph <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> shows the end-point data between about 1.7 seconds to about 2.7 seconds, and the graph <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> shows the end-point data between about 350.8 seconds and about 351.8 seconds. Of course, the transient signal graphs can be stored in computer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> for later reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows how the endpoint reflected intensity signal changes during the polishing operation. Initially, in period <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the metal layer on the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is jagged. The metal layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has some initial topography because of the topology of the underlying patterned layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Due to this topography, the light beam scatters when it impinges the metal layer. As the polishing operation progresses, the metal layer becomes more planar and the reflectivity of the polished metal layer increases during periods <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. As such, the signal strength steadily increases to a stable level. From period <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, as the metal layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is increasingly cleared to expose the oxide layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the overall signal strength declines until the polishing operation is completed. Thus, in period <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, only a small trace of metal remains in the center of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> When entire surface of the substrate is covered with a metal layer, such as copper, the reflection from the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a square profile. As the metal layer is removed from the edge of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the profile of the reflection from the substrate takes on a trapezoidal shape. Eventually, when the metal layer is nearly removed by the polishing operation, the profile of the reflection from the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> takes on a triangular shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The transient signal graphs <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> can be viewed by the operator on the display <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> either during or after the polishing operation. The operator can use the displayed transient signal graphs for a variety of diagnostic and process control decisions (which may be applicable to both reflectivity measurements in metal polishing and interference measurements in oxide polishing). The transient signal graphs can be used to select process parameters in order to optimize polishing uniformity. For example, a test wafer can be polished when initially selecting process parameters, such as the plate rotation rate, carrier head pressure, carrier head rotation rate, carrier head sweep profile, and slurry composition. High reflectivity areas represent regions where metal remains on the substrate, and low reflectivity area represent regions where metal has been removed from the substrate. A noisy transient signal graph indicates that the metal has not been evenly removed from the substrate, whereas a relatively flat transient signal graph indicates uniform polishing. Consequently, the operator can draw immediate conclusions, without resorting to measuring the substrate layer thickness with a metrology tool, regarding the effectiveness of the selected process parameters. The operator can then adjust the polishing parameters, polish another test wafer, and determine whether the new polishing parameters have improved the polishing uniformity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> An operator may also examine the transient signal graphs to determine whether the substrate has been polished to planarity, and whether polishing should be halted. Furthermore, if an operator notes during polishing of an actual device wafer that a portion of the substrate is being polished too slowly or too quickly, the process parameters can be changed while polishing is in progress to adjust the polishing rate profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The transient signal graphs can also be used as a measure of process repeatability. For example, if the transient signal graphs depart significantly from their expected shapes, this indicates that there is some problem in the polishing machine or process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In addition, the transient signal graphs can be used to &ldquo;qualify&rdquo; a process. Specifically, when the polishing machine receives a new set of consumables, e.g., if the polishing pad or slurry is replaced, the operator may wish to verify that the polishing uniformity has not been affected. An operator can compare the transient signal graphs for the substrates polished before and after the change in consumables to determine whether the polishing uniformity has been affected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in step <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> the radial positions Ra, Rb, . . . Rj of the corresponding sampling zones <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>j </italic></highlight>are determined. One way to determine the radial position of a sampling zone is to calculate the position of the laser beneath the substrate based on the measurement time Tmeasure and the platen rotation rate and carrier head sweep profile. Unfortunately, the actual platen rotation rate and carrier head sweep profile may not precisely match the polishing parameters. Therefore, a preferred method <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of determining the radial positions of the sampling zones is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</cross-reference>. First, the time Tsym at which laser beam <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> passes beneath a mid-line <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference>) of the substrate is determined (step <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>). Then the radial positions of the sampling zones are determined from the time difference between the measurement time Tmeasure and the symmetric time Tsym (step <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> One method of determining the symmetry time Tsym is to average the times of the first and last large intensity measurements from each sweep, as these intensity measurements should correspond to the substrate edge. However, this results in some uncertainty in Tsym because the position of the sampling zones beneath the substrate are not known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, in order to compute the symmetric time Tsym in step <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, computer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> determines the first and last large intensity measurements from sweep path <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, i.e., intensity measurements Ic and Ih, and stores the corresponding measurement times Tlead and Ttrail. These lead and trail times Tlead and Ttrail are accumulated on each sweep to generate a series of lead times Tlead<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Tlead<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . TleadN and trail times Ttrail<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Ttrail<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . TtrailN. Computer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> stores lead times Tlead<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Tlead<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . TleadN and the associate number of platen rotations 1, 2, . . . N for each leading spike <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. Similarly, computer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> stores the trail times Ttrail<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Ttrail<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . TtrailN and the associated number of rotations 1, 2, . . . N of each trailing spike <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. Assuming that platen <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> rotates at a substantially constant rate, the times Tlead<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Tlead<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . TleadN form a substantially linear increasing function (shown by line <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>). Similarly, the times Ttrail<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Ttrail<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . . TtrailN also form a substantially linear increasing function (shown by line <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>). Computer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> performs two least square fits to generate two linear functions Tlead(n) and Ttrail(n) as follows: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Once computer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> has calculated the time Tsym at which laser beam <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> crosses midline <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, the radial distance Ra, Rb, . . .

<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, position sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> could be used to calculate the time Tsym when the window crosses midline <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Assuming that sensor <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is positioned opposite carrier head <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, flag <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> would be positioned symmetrically across from transparent window <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The computer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> stores both the trigger time Tstart when the flag interrupts optical beam of the sensor, and the trigger time Tend when the flag clears the optical beam. The time Tsym may be calculated as the average of Tstart and Tend. In yet another embodiment, the platen and carrier head positions could be determined at each sample time Ta, Tb, . . . Th, from optical encoders connected to the platen drive motor and radial drive motor, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Once the radial positions Ra, Rb, . . . Rm of the sampling zones have been calculated, some of the intensity measurement may be disregarded. If the radial position R of a sampling zone is greater than the radius of the substrate, then the intensity measurement for that sampling zone includes mostly radiation reflected by the retaining ring or background reflection from the window or slurry. Therefore, the intensity measurements for any sampling zone that is mostly beneath the retaining ring is ignored. This ensures that spurious intensity measurements are not used in the calculation of the thin film layer reflected intensity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> After several sweeps of laser beam <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> beneath the substrate, computer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> accumulates a set of intensity measurements I<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, I<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, . . .

Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, as the intensity, time, and radial position measurements are accumulated in steps <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the time and intensity measurements are sorted into bins in a data structure <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Each bin is associated with a radial range of sampling zones. For example, intensity measurements for sampling zones located up to 20 mm from the center of the substrate may be placed in a first bin <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference>) which is discussed below, intensity measurements made for sampling zones located between 20 and 30 mm from the center of the substrate may be placed in a second bin <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference>), intensity measurements made for sampling zones located between 30 and 40 mm from the center of the substrate may be placed in a third bin <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</cross-reference>), and so on. The exact number of bins and the radial ranges of the bins depend upon the information that the user desires to extract. In general, the radial range of each bin may be selected so that a sufficient number of intensity measurements are accumulated in the bin to provide visually meaningful information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The calculations discussed above are performed for each bin, thereby providing reflected intensity measurements at a plurality of radial positions across the surface of the substrate. Graphs of the initial and final reflected intensity of the thin film layer as a function of radius are shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> discussed above as well as in FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>H. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Turning now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>H, a number of traces which display how reflected intensity changes during polishing for different radial positions on the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are shown. The charts of FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>H illustrate that the metal layer is removed at different rates for different portions of the substrate. Generally, FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>H show that the metal layer near the center of the substrate is removed last, while the metal layer near the perimeter or edge of the substrate is cleared first. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference> shows that the metal layer within a radius range of 0-20 mm is removed at about 330 seconds. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference> shows that the metal layer within a radius range of 20-30 mm is removed at about 325 seconds. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13C</cross-reference> shows that the metal layer within a radius range of 30-40 mm is removed at about 318 seconds. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13D</cross-reference> shows that the metal layer within a radius range of 40-50 mm is removed at about 310 seconds. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13E</cross-reference> shows that the metal layer within a radius range of 50-60 mm is removed at about 295 seconds. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13F</cross-reference> shows that the metal layer within a radius range of 60-70 mm is removed at about 290 seconds. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13G</cross-reference> shows that the metal layer within a radius range of 70-80 mm is removed at about 290 seconds; and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13H</cross-reference> shows that the metal layer within a radius range of 80-90 mm is removed as early as about 260 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> As shown therein, the reflectance trace for several of the radial ranges exhibit two intensity levels (shown by lines <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>). The distance between the two intensity levels increases with substrate radius. Without being limited to any particular theory, the two intensity levels may be caused by non-symmetric distribution of the slurry or the product of the reaction of the slurry and the metal layer on the substrate. Specifically, on each sweep of the laser beam across the substrate, two data points are usually entered in a bin: one data point which is closer to the leading edge of the substrate and one data point which is closer to the trailing edge of the substrate. However, due to non-symmetric distribution of the slurry and the reaction products beneath the substrate, the laser beam may be more attenuated when passing through slurry layer adjacent different regions of the substrate. Thus, the reflectance traces might also be used as a measure of the uniformity of slurry distribution beneath the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In another implementation, an operator might decide to use only a single bin. In this case, all of the intensity measurements for the specified radial range are used to determine a single intensity trace, which is used for determination of a polishing endpoint in the conventional fashion. The operator can specify this radial range based on examination of the transient signal graphs. For example, if the transient signal graphs show that the center of the substrate is the last portion to be polished, then the operator can select a radial range around the substrate center to ensure that the endpoint is not triggered until all of the metal has been polished away. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The reflection intensity changes during polishing are thus captured for different radial positions on the substrate. The high resolution data acquisition allows a precise time control of each process step in a multi-step operation. A wealth of parameters such as uniformity of the entire wafer and removal rate for different radial portions of the wafer are captured. The acquired high resolution data can be processed on-line or off-line to adjust various variables and parameters to minimize erosion and dishing of the surface layer. If the data is processed in real-time, the real-time feedback data allows a tighter closed-loop control with the process parameters. Further, the reflection data is available for process engineers to experiment with their processing parameters to improve the polishing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The reflectometry traces generated by the optical monitoring system are particularly useful in a multi-step polishing process, such as copper polishing. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; includes a silicon wafer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime;, a patterned oxide layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime;, a tantalum (Ta) or tantalum-nitride (TaN) barrier layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> disposed over the oxide layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>&prime;, and a copper layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; disposed over the barrier layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</cross-reference>, as the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>&prime; is polished, a reflectance trace <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is generated for each radial zone. Each reflectance trace illustrates the bulk removal of the metal layer (flat region <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>), the initial clearing of the metal layer and transition to the barrier layer (drop-off point <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>), initial clearing of the barrier layer and transition to the oxide layer (first decrease in slope point <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>), and complete clearing of the barrier layer and exposure of the oxide layer (second decrease in slope and flatting out of trace at point <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Initially, the substrate is polished with a high-selectivity slurry, e.g., Cabot 5001. The bulk polishing of the metal layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; proceeds until the initial break-through to the barrier layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. At this point, metal may still overlay portions of the barrier layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> , but the barrier layer will be exposed in at least one region. The optical monitoring system can detect this initial exposure of the barrier layer. Specifically, the first reflectance trace that begins to drop can be used as an indication that the barrier layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has been exposed in the associated radial zone. When the optical monitoring system detects the initial exposure of the barrier layer, polishing with the high-selectivity slurry is halted, and polishing with a low selectivity slurry, e.g., Arch Cu10k, is initiated. Polishing with the low selectivity slurry continues until all of the metal layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; and the barrier layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> have been removed. The complete removal of all of the metal layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>&prime; and barrier layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; may be indicated when all of the reflectance traces have leveled off. At this point, the polishing operation is complete. By reliably switching from a high-selectivity slurry to a low-selectivity slurry at the initial clearance of the barrier layer, dishing and erosion can be significantly reduced. In addition, by halting polishing only once all reflectance traces indicate, complete removal of the barrier layer can be ensured. </paragraph>
