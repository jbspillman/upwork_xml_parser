<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to newly identified polynucleotides and the polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides, uses of such polynucleotides and polypeptides, and their production. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Unlike bacterium, which exist as a single compartment surrounded by a membrane, human cells and other eucaryotes are subdivided by membranes into many functionally distinct compartments. Each membrane-bounded compartment, or organelle, contains different proteins essential for the function of the organelle. The cell uses &ldquo;sorting signals,&rdquo; which are amino acid motifs located within the protein, to target proteins to particular cellular organelles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One type of sorting signal, called a signal sequence, a signal peptide, or a leader sequence, directs a class of proteins to an organelle called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER separates the membrane-bounded proteins from all other types of proteins. Once localized to the ER, both groups of proteins can be further directed to another organelle called the Golgi apparatus. Here, the Golgi distributes the proteins to vesicles, including secretory vesicles, the cell membrane, lysosomes, and the other organelles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Proteins targeted to the ER by a signal sequence can be released into the extracellular space as a secreted protein. For example, vesicles containing secreted proteins can fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents into the extracellular space&mdash;a process called exocytosis. Exocytosis can occur constitutively or after receipt of a triggering signal. In the latter case, the proteins are stored in secretory vesicles (or secretory granules) until exocytosis is triggered. Similarly, proteins residing on the cell membrane can also be secreted into the extracellular space by proteolytic cleavage of a &ldquo;linker&rdquo; holding the protein to the membrane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Despite the great progress made in recent years, only a small number of genes encoding human secreted proteins have been identified. These secreted proteins include the commercially valuable human insulin, interferon, Factor VIII, human growth hormone, tissue plasminogen activator, and erythropoeitin. Thus, in light of the pervasive role of secreted proteins in human physiology, a need exists for identifying and characterizing novel human secreted proteins and the genes that encode them. This knowledge will allow one to detect, to treat, and to prevent medical disorders by using secreted proteins or the genes that encode them. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to novel polynucleotides and the encoded polypeptides. Moreover, the present invention relates to vectors, host cells, antibodies, and recombinant methods for producing the polypeptides and polynucleotides. Also provided are diagnostic methods for detecting disorders related to the polypeptides, and therapeutic methods for treating such disorders. The invention further relates to screening methods for identifying binding partners of the polypeptides. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The following definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of certain terms used throughout this specification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; refers to material removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring), and thus is altered &ldquo;by the hand of man&rdquo; from its natural state. For example, an isolated polynucleotide could be part of a vector or a composition of matter, or could be contained within a cell, and still be &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; because that vector, composition of matter, or particular cell is not the original environment of the polynucleotide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, a &ldquo;secreted&rdquo; protein refers to those proteins capable of being directed to the ER, secretory vesicles, or the extracellular space as a result of a signal sequence, as well as those proteins released into the extracellular space without necessarily containing a signal sequence. If the secreted protein is released into the extracellular space, the secreted protein can undergo extracellular processing to produce a &ldquo;mature&rdquo; protein. Release into the extracellular space can occur by many mechanisms, including exocytosis and proteolytic cleavage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In specific embodiments, the polynucleotides of the invention are less than 300 kb, 200 kb, 100 kb, 50 kb, 15 kb, 10 kb, or 7.5 kb in length. In a further embodiment, polynucleotides of the invention comprise at least 15 contiguous nucleotides of the coding sequence, but do not comprise all or a portion of any intron. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid comprising the coding sequence does not contain coding sequences of a genomic flanking gene (i.e., 5&prime; or 3&prime; to the gene in the genome). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As used herein, a &ldquo;polynucleotide&rdquo; refers to a molecule having a nucleic acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO:X or the cDNA contained within the clone deposited with the ATCC. For example, the polynucleotide can contain the nucleotide sequence of the full length cDNA sequence, including the 5&prime; and 3&prime; untranslated sequences, the coding region, with or without the signal sequence, the secreted protein coding region, as well as fragments, epitopes, domains, and variants of the nucleic acid sequence. Moreover, as used herein, a &ldquo;polypeptide&rdquo; refers to a molecule having the translated amino acid sequence generated from the polynucleotide as broadly defined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the full length sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X was often generated by overlapping sequences contained in multiple clones (contig analysis). A representative clone containing all or most of the sequence for SEQ ID NO:X was deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (&ldquo;ATCC&rdquo;). As shown in Table 1, each clone is identified by a cDNA Clone ID (Identifier) and the ATCC Deposit Number. The ATCC is located at 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110-2209, USA. The ATCC deposit was made pursuant to the terms of the Budapest Treaty on the international recognition of the deposit of microorganisms for purposes of patent procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A &ldquo;polynucleotide&rdquo; of the present invention also includes those polynucleotides capable of hybridizing, under stringent hybridization conditions, to sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:X, the complement thereof, or the cDNA within the clone deposited with the ATCC. &ldquo;Stringent hybridization conditions&rdquo; refers to an overnight incubation at 42&deg; C. in a solution comprising 50% formamide, 5&times;SSC (750 mM NaCl, 75 mM sodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5&times;Denhardt&apos;s solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 &mgr;g/ml denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 0.1&times;SSC at about 65&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Also contemplated are nucleic acid molecules that hybridize to the polynucleotides of the present invention at lower stringency hybridization conditions. Changes in the stringency of hybridization and signal detection are primarily accomplished through the manipulation of formamide concentration (lower percentages of formamide result in lowered stringency); salt conditions, or temperature. For example, lower stringency conditions include an overnight incubation at 37&deg; C. in a solution comprising 6&times;SSPE (20&times;SSPE&equals;3M NaCl; 0.2M NaH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>; 0.02M EDTA, pH 7.4), 0.5% SDS, 30% formamide, 100 &mgr;g/ml salmon sperm blocking DNA; followed by washes at 50&deg; C. with 1&times;SSPE, 0.1% SDS. In addition, to achieve even lower stringency, washes performed following stringent hybridization can be done at higher salt concentrations (e.g. 5&times;SSC). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Note that variations in the above conditions may be accomplished through the inclusion and/or substitution of alternate blocking reagents used to suppress background in hybridization experiments. Typical blocking reagents include Denhardt&apos;s reagent, BLOTTO, heparin, denatured salmon sperm DNA, and commercially available proprietary formulations. The inclusion of specific blocking reagents may require modification of the hybridization conditions described above, due to problems with compatibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Of course, a polynucleotide which hybridizes only to polyA&plus; sequences (such as any 3&prime; terminal polyA&plus; tract of a cDNA shown in the sequence listing), or to a complementary stretch of T (or U) residues, would not be included in the definition of &ldquo;polynucleotide,&rdquo; since such a polynucleotide would hybridize to any nucleic acid molecule containing a poly (A) stretch or the complement thereof (e.g., practically any double-stranded cDNA clone). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotide of the present invention can be composed of any polyribonucleotide or polydeox-ribonucleotide, which may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. For example, polynucleotides can be composed of single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. In addition, the polynucleotide can be composed of triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. A polynucleotide may also contain one or more modified bases or DNA or RNA backbones modified for stability or for other reasons. &ldquo;Modified&rdquo; bases include, for example, tritylated bases and unusual bases such as inosine. A variety of modifications can be made to DNA and RNA; thus, &ldquo;polynucleotide&rdquo; embraces chemically, enzymatically, or metabolically modified forms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The polypeptide of the present invention can be composed of amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds, i.e., peptide isosteres, and may contain amino acids other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids. The polypeptides may be modified by either natural processes, such as posttranslational processing, or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. Such modifications are well described in basic texts and in more detailed monographs, as well as in a voluminous research literature. Modifications can occur anywhere in a polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains and the amino or carboxyl termini. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also, a given polypeptide may contain many types of modifications. Polypeptides may be branched, for example, as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched, and branched cyclic polypeptides may result from posttranslation natural processes or may be made by synthetic methods. Modifications include acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, pegylation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination. (See, for instance, PROTEINS&mdash;STRUCTURE AND MOLECULAR PROPERTIES, 2nd Ed., T. E. Creighton, W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1993); POSTTRANSLATIONAL COVALENT MODIFICATION OF PROTEINS, B. C. Johnson, Ed., Academic Press, New York, pgs. 1-12 (1983); Seifter et al., Meth Enzymol 182:626-646 (1990); Rattan et al., Ann NY Acad Sci 663:48-62 (1992).) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;SEQ ID NO:X&rdquo; refers to a polynucleotide sequence while &ldquo;SEQ ID NO:Y&rdquo; refers to a polypeptide sequence, both sequences identified by an integer specified in Table 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;A polypeptide having biological activity&rdquo; refers to polypeptides exhibiting activity similar, but not necessarily identical to, an activity of a polypeptide of the present invention, including mature forms, as measured in a particular biological assay, with or without dose dependency. In the case where dose dependency does exist, it need not be identical to that of the polypeptide, but rather substantially similar to the dose-dependence in a given activity as compared to the polypeptide of the present invention (i.e., the candidate polypeptide will exhibit greater activity or not more than about 25-fold less and, preferably, not more than about tenfold less activity, and most preferably, not more than about three-fold less activity relative to the polypeptide of the present invention.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Polynucleotides and Polypeptides of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In specific embodiments, polypeptides of the invention comprise the following amino acid sequence: TFKSLWKHWTLAGPGNIGKNWIGR (SEQ ID NO:203). Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> This gene is expressed primarily in bone marrow tissue, and to a lesser extent in eosinophils and fetal liver tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, hematopoietic or immune disorders and diseases, particularly recovery of the hematopoietic system after anticancer therapy. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the immune, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels may be routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., immune, bone marrow and hemopoietic cells and tissue, eosinophils and other blood cells, hepatic tissue, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The tissue distribution in bone marrow and fetal liver tissues indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the regulation and/or reconstitution of hematopoietic cells after cancer therapy. This gene product is primarily expressed in hematopoietic cells and tissues, suggesting that it plays a role in the survival, proliferation, and/or differentiation of hematopoieitic lineages. This is particularly supported by the expression of this gene product in fetal liver and bone marrow, the two primary sites of definitive hematopoiesis. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:11 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a-b, where a is any integer between 1 to 961 of SEQ ID NO:11, b is an integer of 15 to 975, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:11, and where b is greater than or equal to a&plus;14. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 2 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> When tested against K562 cell lines, supernatants removed from cells containing this gene activated the ISRE (interferon-sensitive responsive element) pathway. Thus, it is likely that this gene activates kidney cells, and to a lesser extent other cells or cells types, through the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway. ISRE (interferon-sensitive responsive element)&mdash;also a promoter element found upstream in many genes which are involved in the JAK-STAT pathway. The JAK-STAT pathway is a large, signal transduction pathway involved in the differentiation and proliferation of cells. Therefore, activation of the JAK-STATs pathway, reflected by the binding of the ISRE element, can be used to indicate proteins involved in the proliferation and differentiation of cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In specific embodiments, polypeptides of the invention comprise the following amino acid sequence: HEGTWRWEAPTPLQSLGPTTPSLPSVADLCQDGHGGCSEHANCSQVGT (SEQ ID NO:204). Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention. The gene encoding the disclosed cDNA is thought to reside on chromosome 3. Accordingly, polynucleotides related to this invention are useful as a marker in linkage analysis for chromosome 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The protein product of this clone is a homolog of a secreted protein member of the hyaladherin family. It&apos;s closest match is TSG-6. The expression of TSG-6 is TNF- and IL-1-inducible, and is found in elevated amounts in synovial fluid from rheumatoid versus normal joints. There is a strong link between the TSG-6 protein and inflammation. The gene was isolated from TNF-induced fibroblasts. It is transcriptionally induced by TNF, LPS, and IL-1. Tissues that express TSG-6 include fibroblasts, monocytes, and synovial cells. It binds hyaluronic acid, as does another member of the CD44 family, which functions as the lymphocyte homing receptor. TSG-6 also complexes with the serpin, inter-alpha-inhibitor (IaI). IaI inhibits proteases such as cathepsin G and leukocyte elastase, which are involved in tissue damage during inflammation. A higher level of TSG-6 protein is found in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid versus normal joints. The most compelling evidence for TSGF-6 as an anti-inflammatory is that it can inhibit IL-1-induced acute inflammation, as well as dexamethasone in the mouse air pouch inflammation model. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> This gene is expressed primarily in myoloid progenitor cell line, spleen and bone marrow and to a lesser extent in synovial tissue and adipose tissue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, inflammation caused by acute injury or chronic disease, and other immune system disorders. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the immune, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels may be routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., inflammed, immune, cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Preferred epitopes include those comprising a sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:108 as residues: Pro-8 to Trp-15, Cys-17 to Asn-36, Leu-42 to Cys-49, Glu-63 to Val-68. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The tissue distribution in immune tissues, in conjunction with the biological activity data, suggests that the protein product of this clone is useful for the treatment and diagnosis of hematopoetic related disorders such as anemia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or leukemia since stromal cells are important in the production of cells of hematopoietic lineages. The uses include bone marrow cell ex vivo culture, bone marrow transplantation, bone marrow reconstitution, radiotherapy or chemotherapy of neoplasia. The gene product may also be involved in lymphopoiesis, therefore, it can be used in immune disorders such as infection, inflammation, allergy, immunodeficiency etc. In addition, this gene product may have commercial utility in the expansion of stem cells and committed progenitors of various blood lineages, and in the differentiation and/or proliferation of various cell types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In addition, the expression of this gene product in synovium, as well as the homology to TSG-6, suggests a role in the detection and treatment of disorders and conditions affecting the skeletal system, in particular osteoporosis as well as disorders afflicting connective tissues (e.g., arthritis, trauma, tendonitis, chrondomalacia and inflammation), such as in the diagnosis or treatment of various autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, scleroderma, and dermatomyositis as well as dwarfism, spinal deformation, and specific joint abnormalities as well as chondrodysplasias (ie. spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, familial arthritis, Atelosteogenesis type II, metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid). Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:12 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a-b, where a is any integer between 1 to 2739 of SEQ ID NO:12, b is an integer of 15 to 2753, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:12, and where b is greater than or equal to a&plus;14. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 3 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> When tested against PC12 cell lines, supernatants removed from cells containing this gene activated the EGR1 pathway. Thus, it is likely that this gene activates sensory neuron cells, and to a lesser extent other neuronal cells, through the EGR1 signal transduction pathway. EGR1 is a separate signal transduction pathway from JAK-STAT, genes containing the EGR1 promoter are induced in various tissues and cell types upon activation, leading the cells to undergo differentiation and proliferation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> This gene is expressed primarily in chondrosarcoma tissue, and to a lesser extent in glioblastoma and bone marrow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, cancers of the bone and CNS. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the skeletal, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels may be routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., skeletal, hematopoietic, cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Preferred epitopes include those comprising a sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:109 as residues: Ala-15 to Gly-22, Asp-44 to Ile-53. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The tissue distribution in chondrosarcoma tissue, in conjunction with the detected biological activity in sensory neurons, indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the detection/treatment of neurodegenerative disease states and behavioural disorders such as Alzheimers Disease, Parkinsons Disease, Huntingtons Disease, Tourette Syndrome, schizophrenia, mania, dementia, paranoia, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, learning disabilities, ALS, psychoses, autism, and altered behaviors, including disorders in feeding, sleep patterns, balance, and perception. In addition, the gene or gene product may also play a role in the treatment and/or detection of developmental disorders associated with the developing embryo, sexually-linked disorders, or disorders of the cardiovascular system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the expression of this gene product in synovium would suggest a role in the detection and treatment of disorders and conditions affecting the skeletal system, in particular osteoporosis as well as disorders aflicting connective tissues (e.g., arthritis, trauma, tendonitis, chrondomalacia and inflammation) in the diagnosis or treatment of various autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, scleroderma, and dermatomyositis as well as dwarfism, spinal deformation, andspecific joint abnormalities as well as chondrodysplasias ie. spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, familial osteoarthritis, Atelosteogenesis type II, metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid. Furthermore, the tissue distribution in chondrosarcoma tissue indicates that the translation product of this gene is useful for the detection and/or treatment of cancers of catrilage, connective tissues, and synovium, for example, as well as cancers of other tissues where expression has been observed. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:13 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a-b, where a is any integer between 1 to 1011 of SEQ ID NO:13, b is an integer of 15 to 1025, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:13, and where b is greater than or equal to a&plus;14. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 4 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In specific embodiments, polypeptides of the invention comprise the following amino acid sequence: LKVPTCYSANT (SEQ ID NO:205). Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> This gene is expressed primarily in cerebellum and infant brain tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, neural or developmental disorders, particularly neurodegenerative conditions in the central nervous system, and congential defects. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the central nervous system, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels may be routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., brain and other tissue of the nervous system, developmental, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, amniotic fluid, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Preferred epitopes include those comprising a sequence shown in SEQ ID NO. 110 as residues: Gly-40 to Lys-45. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The tissue distribution in brain and cerebellum tissues indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for treating cell loss in the central nervous system due to trauma, ischaemia, or disease. Furthermore, the tissue distribution indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the detection/treatment of neurodegenerative disease states and behavioural disorders such as Alzheimers Disease, Parkinsons Disease, Huntingtons Disease, Tourette Syndrome, schizophrenia, mania, dementia, paranoia, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, learning disabilities, ALS, psychoses, autism, and altered behaviors, including disorders in feeding, sleep patterns, balance, and perception. In addition, the gene or gene product may also play a role in the treatment and/or detection of developmental disorders associated with the developing embryo, or sexually-linked disorders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the expression within infant tissue suggests this protein may play a role in the regulation of cellular division, and may show utility in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other proliferative disorders. Similarly, developmental tissues rely on decisions involving cell differentiation and/or apoptosis in pattern formation. Dysregulation of apoptosis can result in inappropriate suppression of cell death, as occurs in the development of some cancers, or in failure to control the extent of cell death, as is believed to occur in acquired immunodeficiency and certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Therefore, the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention are useful in treating, detecting, and/or preventing said disorders and conditions, in addition to other types of degenerative conditions. Thus this protein may also be involved in apoptosis or tissue differentiation and could again be useful in cancer therapy. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:14 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a-b, where a is any integer between 1 to 767 of SEQ ID NO:14, b is an integer of 15 to 781, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:14, and where b is greater than or equal to a&plus;14. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Features of Protein Encoded by Gene No: 5 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In specific embodiments, polypeptides of the invention comprise the following amino acid sequence:

The gene encoding the disclosed cDNA is thought to reside on chromosome 15. Accordingly, polynucleotides related to this invention are useful as a marker in linkage analysis for chromosome 15. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> This gene is expressed primarily in colon cancer cell line and glioblastoma tissue, and to a lesser extent in synovial fluid, placenta, and fetal liver tissues. </paragraph>

Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the digestive tract, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels may be routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., gastrointestinal tissue, synovial tissue, hepatic tissue, nervous tissue, vascular, developmental, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder. </paragraph>

The protein product of this clone is useful for the treatment and diagnosis of hematopoietic related disorders such as anemia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or leukemia since stromal cells are important in the production of cells of hematopoietic lineages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The uses include bone marrow cell ex-vivo culture, bone marrow transplantation, bone marrow reconstitution, radiotherapy or chemotherapy of neoplasia.

The protein is useful for the modulation of the immune response to various tissues and cell types, thought particularly to developmental and gastrointestinal cell and tissues. The protein is useful for modulating apoptosis and may show utility in combating cancer and degenerative disorders. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> When tested against K562 leukemia cell lines, supernatants removed from cells containing this gene activated the ISRE assay. Thus, it is likely that this gene activates leukemia cells, and to a lesser extent immune cells, in addition to other cells or cell-types, through the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway. The interferon-sensitive response element is a promoter element found upstream of many genes which are involved in the JAK-STAT pathway. The JAK-STAT pathway is a large, signal transduction pathway involved in the differentiation and proliferation of cells. Therefore, activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, reflected by the binding of the ISRE element, can be used to indicate proteins involved in the proliferation and differentiation of cells. </paragraph>

Furthermore, expression within embryonic tissue, in conjunction with the biological activity data, as well as other cellular sources marked by proliferating cells indicates that this protein may play a role in the regulation of cellular division, and may show utility in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other proliferative disorders. Similarly, embryonic development also involves decisions involving cell differentiation and/or apoptosis in pattern formation. Thus, this protein may also be involved in apoptosis or tissue differentiation and could again be useful in cancer therapy. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> When tested against K562 cell lines, supernatants removed from cells containing this gene activated the ISRE (interferon-sensitive responsive element) pathway. Thus, it is likely that this gene activates kidney cells, and to a lesser extent other uro-genital cells, through the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway. ISRE is a promoter element found upstream in many genes which are involved in the JAK-STAT pathway. The JAK-STAT pathway is a large, signal transduction pathway involved in the differentiation and proliferation of cells. Therefore, activation of the JAK-STAT pathway, reflected by the binding of the ISRE element, can be used to indicate proteins involved in the proliferation and differentiation of cells.

<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, developmental, urogenital, and immune disorders. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the immune and urogenital systems, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels may be routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., immune, developmental, urogenital, cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, amniotic fluid, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder. </paragraph>

Expression of this gene product in T-cells indicates the protein may play a role in regulating the proliferation; survival; differentiation; and/or activation of potentially all hematopoietic cell lineages, including blood stem cells. Elevated levels of expression of this gene product in T cell lineages indicates that it may play an active role in normal T cell function and in the regulation of the immune response. For example, this gene product may be involved in T cell activation, in the activation or control of differentiation of other hematopoietic cell lineages, in antigen recognition, or in T cell proliferation. </paragraph>

It may also be produced in the vasculature and have effects on other cells within the circulation, such as hematopoietic cells. It may serve to promote the proliferation, survival, activation, and/or differentiation of hematopoietic cells, as well as other cells throughout the body.

This gene product is also useful in assays designed to identify binding agents, as such agents (antagonists) are useful as male contraceptive agents. Similarly, the protein is believed to be useful in the treatment and/or diagnosis of testicular cancer. The testes are also a site of active gene expression of transcripts that may be expressed, particularly at low levels, in other tissues of the body. Therefore, this gene product may be expressed in other specific tissues or organs where it may play related functional roles in other processes, such as hematopoiesis, inflanmmation, bone formation, and kidney function, to name a few possible target indications.

<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> This gene is expressed primarily in human testicular tumors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, reproductive or endocrine disorders, particularly cancers. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the endocrine and reproductive systems, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels may be routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., reproductive, endocrine, or cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, seminal fluid, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> The tissue distribution in tesiticular cancer tissue indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the treatment and diagnosis of conditions concerning proper testicular function (e.g. endocrine function, sperm maturation), as well as cancer. Therefore, this gene product is useful in the treatment of male infertility and/or impotence. This gene product is also useful in assays designed to identify binding agents, as such agents (antagonists) are useful as male contraceptive agents. Similarly, the protein is believed to be useful in the treatment and/or diagnosis of testicular cancer. The testes are also a site of active gene expression of transcripts that may be expressed, particularly at low levels, in other tissues of the body. Therefore, this gene product may be expressed in other specific tissues or organs where it may play related functional roles in other processes, such as hematopoiesis, inflammation, bone formation, and kidney function, to name a few possible target indications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the tissue distribution indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other proliferative disorders, as well as cancers of other tissues where expression has been observed. Expression within tumor tissues and other cellular sources marked by proliferating cells indicates that this protein may play a role in the regulation of cellular division. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:32 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a-b, where a is any integer between 1 to 677 of SEQ ID NO:32, b is an integer of 15 to 691, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:32, and where b is greater than or equal to a&plus;14. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> This gene is expressed primarily in resting T cells and CD34(&plus;) cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, immune and hematopoietic disorders. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the immune system, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels may be routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., immune, hematopoietic, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder. </paragraph>

Elevated levels of expression of this gene product in T cell lineages indicates that it may play an active role in normal T cell function and in the regulation of the immune response. For example, this gene product may be involved in T cell activation, in the activation or control of differentiation of other hematopoietic cell lineages, in antigen recognition, or in T cell proliferation. Expression of this gene product in T cells also strongly indicates a role for this protein in immune function and immune surveillance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> Expression of this gene product in T-cells further indicates the protein may play a role in regulating the proliferation; survival; differentiation; and/or activation of potentially all hematopoietic cell lineages, including blood stem cells. This gene product may be involved in the regulation of cytokine production, antigen presentation, or other processes that may also suggest a usefulness in the treatment of cancer (e.g., by boosting immune responses). Since the gene is expressed in cells of lymphoid origin, the natural gene product may be involved in immune functions. Therefore it may be also used as an agent for immunological disorders including arthritis, asthma, immune deficiency diseases such as AIDS, leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis, acne, and psoriasis, and tissues. In addition, this gene product may have commercial utility in the expansion of stem cells and committed progenitors of various blood lineages, and in the differentiation and/or proliferation of various cell types. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> The secreted protein can also be used to determine biological activity, to raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate igands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions and as nutritional supplements. It may also have a very wide range of biological activities although no evidence for any is provided in the specification. Typical of these are cytokine, cell proliferation/differentiation modulating activity or induction of other cytokines; immunostimulating/immunosuppressant activities (e.g., for treating human immunodeficiency virus infection, cancer, autoimmune diseases and allergy); regulation of haematopoiesis (e.g., for treating anaemia or as adjunct to chemotherapy); stimulation of growth of bone, cartilage, tendons, ligaments and/or nerves (e.g., for treating wounds, stimulation of follicle stimulating hormone (for control of fertility); chemotactic and chemokinetic activities (e.g., for treating infections, tumours); haemostatic or thrombolytic activity (e.g., for treating haemophilia, cardiac infarction etc.); anti-inflammatory activity (e.g., for treating septic shock, Crohn&apos;s disease); as antimicrobials; for treating psoriasis or other hyperproliferative disease; for regulation of metabolism, behaviour, and many others.

Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:33 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a-b, where a is any integer between 1 to 686 of SEQ ID NO:33, b is an integer of 15 to 700, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:33, and where b is greater than or equal to a&plus;14. </paragraph>

For example, this gene product may be involved in T cell activation, in the activation or control of differentiation of other hematopoietic cell lineages, in antigen recognition, or in T cell proliferation. Furthermore, expression of this gene product in T cells also strongly indicates a role for this protein in immune function and immune surveillance.

<paragraph id="P-0470" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0470&rsqb;</number> Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, hematopoietic or immune disorders and diseases; leukemias; inflammation. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the immune system, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels may be routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., hematopoietic, immune, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0471" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0471&rsqb;</number> The tissue distribution in myeloid progenitor cells indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the diagnosis and/or treatment of hematopoietic disorders and immune dysfunction. This gene is expressed at elevated levels in a myeloid progenitor cell line, suggesting that it may be involved in the proliferation, survival, and/or differentiation of hematopoietic cell lineages. In addition, it may be produced by myeloid cells in order to recruit other blood cells to a particular site, such as a site of inflammation, or it may be responsible for activating hematopoietic cells, such as T cells. Similarly, the expression within myeloid progenitor cells indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the treatment and diagnosis of hematopoetic related disorders such as anemia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or leukemia since stromal cells are important in the production of cells of hematopoietic lineages. The uses include bone marrow cell ex vivo culture, bone marrow transplantation, bone marrow reconstitution, radiotherapy or chemotherapy of neoplasia. The gene product may also be involved in lymphopoiesis, therefore, it can be used in immune disorders such as infection, inflammation, allergy, immunodeficiency etc. In addition, this gene product may have commercial utility in the expansion of stem cells and committed progenitors of various blood lineages, and in the differentiation and/or proliferation of various cell types. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues. </paragraph>

Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO:68 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably, such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence is cumbersome. Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a-b, where a is any integer between 1 to 780 of SEQ ID NO:68, b is an integer of 15 to 794, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:68, and where b is greater than or equal to a &plus;14. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0475" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0475&rsqb;</number> Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention. The gene encoding the disclosed cDNA is believed to reside on chromosome 8. Accordingly, polynucleotides related to this invention are useful as a marker in linkage analysis for chromosome 8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0476" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0476&rsqb;</number> This gene is expressed primarily in infant and fetal brain, and to a lesser extent, in hematopoietic tissues, such as T cells, B cell lymphoma, and bone marrow cell lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0477" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0477&rsqb;</number> Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, hematopoietic disorders; lymphoproliferative disorders; neurological disorders such as Alzheimers and schizophrenia, in addition to developmental disorders and diseases. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly of the immune system and/or CNS, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels may be routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., neural, immune, developmental, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., lymph, serum, plasma, urine, amniotic fluid, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0478" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0478&rsqb;</number> Preferred epitopes include those comprising a sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:165 as residues: Pro-7 to Tyr-14. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0479" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0479&rsqb;</number> The tissue distribution in infant and fetal brain indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the diagnosis and/or treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and/or hematopoietic disorders. This gene displays elevated levels of expression in fetal/infant brain, as well as in a variety of hematopoietic tissues. Thus, this gene product may play a role in the development of the brain and/or nervous system, and may be involved in the survival or differentiation of neurons. It may therefore be useful in the treatment of neurological disorders such as Alzheimers, schizophrenia, or ALS, and may protect neurons or effect neuronal regeneration. Likewise, this gene product may play a role in hematopoietic development, and could be useful in their proliferation, survival, and/or differentiation of blood cell lineages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0480" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0480&rsqb;</number> The secreted protein can also be used to determine biological activity, to raise antibodies, as tissue markers, to isolate cognate ligands or receptors, to identify agents that modulate their interactions and as nutritional supplements. It may also have a very wide range of biological acitivities. Typical of these are cytokine, cell proliferation/differentiation modulating activity or induction of other cytokines; immunostimulating/immunosuppressant activities (e.g., for treating human immunodeficiency virus infection, cancer, autoimmune diseases and allergy); regulation of hematopoiesis (e.g., for treating anaemia or as adjunct to chemotherapy); stimulation or growth of bone, cartilage, tendons, ligaments and/or nerves (e.g., for treating wounds, stimulation of follicle stimulating hormone (for control of fertility); chemotactic and chemokinetic activities (e.g., for treating infections, tumors); hemostatic or thrombolytic activity (e.g., for treating haemophilia, cardiac infarction etc.); anti-inflammatory activity (e.g., for treating septic shock, Crohn&apos;s disease); as antimicrobials; for treating psoriasis or other hyperproliferative diseases; for regulation of metabolism, and behaviour. Also contemplated is the use of the corresponding nucleic acid in gene therapy procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0481" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0481&rsqb;</number> The protein may play a role in the regulation of cellular division, and may show utility in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other proliferative disorders. Similarly, developmental tissues rely on decisions involving cell differentiation and/or apoptosis in pattern formation. Dysregulation of apoptosis can result in inappropriate suppression of cell death, as occurs in the development of some cancers, or in failure to control the extent of cell death, as is believed to occur in acquired immunodeficiency and certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Therefore, the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention are useful in treating, detecting, and/or preventing said disorders and conditions, in addition to other types of degenerative conditions. Thus this protein may also be involved in apoptosis or tissue differentiation and could again be useful in cancer therapy. Protein, as well as, antibodies directed against the protein may show utility as a tumor marker and/or immunotherapy targets for the above listed tissues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0482" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0482&rsqb;</number> Many polynucleotide sequences, such as EST sequences, are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases.

<paragraph id="P-0488" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0488&rsqb;</number> The tissue distribution in macrophages and bone marrow cells indicates that polynucleotides and polypeptides corresponding to this gene are useful for the diagnosis and/or treatment of hematopoietic disorders. This gene is expressed at higher levels in hematopoietic cells such as macrophages, as well as in tissues that support hematopoietic development, such as bone marrow stromal cells. Thus, this gene product may effect hematopoietic cell proliferation, survival, and/or differentiation, as well as hematopoietic cell activation and immune function. Thus, this gene may be useful in boosting stem cell numbers, enhancing immune surveilance, or combatting leukemias or lymphoproliferative disorders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0489" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0489&rsqb;</number> The uses include bone marrow cell ex vivo culture, bone marrow transplantation, bone marrow reconstitution, radiotherapy or chemotherapy of neoplasia.

Accordingly, preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a-b, where a is any integer between 1 to 719 of SEQ ID NO:70, b is an integer of 15 to 733, where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO:70, and where b is greater than or equal to a &plus;14. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0493" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0493&rsqb;</number> Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention. The gene encoding the disclosed cDNA is believed to reside on chromosome 1. Accordingly, polynucleotides related to this invention are useful as a marker in linkage analysis for chromosome 8. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0494" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0494&rsqb;</number> Numerous biological actions, for instance, response to certain stimuli and natural biological processes, are controlled by factors, such as cytokines. Many cytokines act through receptors by engaging the receptor and producing an intra-cellular response. For example, tumor necrosis factors (TNF) alpha and beta are cytokines, which act through TNF receptors to regulate numerous biological processes, including protection against infection and induction of shock and inflammatory disease. The TNF molecules belong to the &ldquo;TNF-ligand&rdquo; superfamily, and act together with their receptors or counter-ligands, the &ldquo;TNF-receptor&rdquo; superfamily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0495" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0495&rsqb;</number> So far, nine members of the TNF ligand superfamily have been identified and ten members of the TNF-receptor superfamily have been characterized. Among the ligands, there are included TNF-a, lymphotoxin-a (LT-a, also known as TNF-b), LT-b (found in complex heterotrimer LT-a2-b), FasL, CD40L, CD27L, CD30L, 4-1BBL, OX40L and nerve growth factor (NGF). The superfamily of TNF receptors includes the p55TNF receptor, p75TNF receptor, TNF receptor-related protein, FAS antigen or APO-1, CD40, CD27, CD30, 4-1BB, OX40, low affinity p75 and NGF-receptor (Meager, A., Biologicals, 22:291-295 (1994)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0496" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0496&rsqb;</number> Many members of the TNF-ligand superfamily are expressed by activated T-cells, implying that they are necessary for T-cell interactions with other cell types which underlie cell ontogeny and functions. (Meager, A., supra). Considerable insight into the essential functions of several members of the TNF receptor family has been gained from the identification and creation of mutants that abolish the expression of these proteins. For example, naturally occurring mutations in the FAS antigen and its ligand cause lymphoproliferative disease (Watanabe-Fukunaga, R., et al., Nature 356:314 (1992)), perhaps reflecting a failure of programmed cell death. Mutations of the CD40 ligand cause an X-linked immunodeficiency state characterized by high levels of immunoglobulin M and low levels of immunoglobulin G in plasma, indicating faulty T-cell-dependent B-cell activation (Allen, R. C. et al., Science 259:990 (1993)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0497" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0497&rsqb;</number> Targeted mutations of the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor cause a disorder characterized by faulty sensory innovation of peripheral structures (Lee, K. F. et al., Cell 69:737 (1992)). TNF and LT-a are capable of binding to two TNF receptors (the 55- and 75-kd TNF receptors). A large number of biological effects elicited by TNF and LT-a, acting through their receptors, include hemorrhagic necrosis of transplanted tumors, cytotoxicity, a role in endotoxic shock, inflammation, immunoregulation, proliferation and anti-viral responses, as well as protection against the deleterious effects of ionizing radiation. TNF and LT-a are involved in the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases, including endotoxic shock, cerebral malaria, tumors, autoimmune disease, AIDS and graft-host rejection (Beutler, B. and Von Huffel, C., Science 264:667-668 (1994)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0498" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0498&rsqb;</number> Mutations in the p55 Receptor cause increased susceptibility to microbial infection. Moreover, an about 80 amino acid domain near the C-terminus of TNFR1 (p55) and Fas was reported as the &ldquo;death domain,&rdquo; which is responsible for transducing signals for programmed cell death (Tartaglia et al., Cell 74:845 (1993)). Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a physiologic process essential for the normal development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms (H. Steller, Science 267:1445-1449 (1995)). Derangements of apoptosis contribute to the pathogenesis of several human diseases including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (C. B. Thompson, Science 267:1456-1462 (1995)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0499" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0499&rsqb;</number> Recently, much attention has focused on the signal transduction and biological function of two cell surface death receptors, Fas/APO-1 and TNFR-1 (J. L. Cleveland et al., Cell 81:479-482 (1995); A. Fraser, et al., Cell 85:781-784 (1996); S. Nagata et al., Science 267:1449-56 (1995)). Both are members of the TNF receptor family which also include TNFR-2, low affinity NGFR, CD40, and CD30, among others (C. A. Smith et al., Science 248:1019-23 (1990); M. Tewari et al., in Modular Texts in Molecular and Cell Biology M. Purton, Heldin, Carl, Ed. (Chapman and Hall, London, 1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0500" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0500&rsqb;</number> While family members are defined by the presence of cysteine-rich repeats in their extracellular domains, Fas/APO-1 and TNFR-1 also share a region of intracellular homology, appropriately designated the &ldquo;death domain&rdquo;, which is distantly related to the Drosophila suicide gene, reaper (P. Golstein, et al., Cell 81:185-186 (1995); K. White et al., Science 264:677-83 (1994)). This shared death domain indicates that both receptors interact with a related set of signal transducing molecules that, until recently, remained unidentified. Activation of Fas/APO-1 recruits the death domain-containing adapter molecule FADD/MORT1 (A. M. Chinnaiyan et al., Cell 81: 505-12 (1995); M. P. Boldin et al., J. Biol Chem 270:7795-8 (1995); F. C. Kischkel et al., EMBO 14:5579-5588 (1995)), which in turn binds and presumably activates FLICE/MACH1, a member of the ICE/CED-3 family of pro-apoptotic proteases (M. Muzio et al., Cell 85:817-827 (1996); M. P. Boldin et al., Cell 85:803-815 (1996)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0501" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0501&rsqb;</number> While the central role of Fas/APO-1 is to trigger cell death, TNFR-1 can signal an array of diverse biological activities-many of which stem from its ability to activate NF-kB (L. A. Tartaglia et al., Immunol Today 13:151-3 (1992)). Accordingly, TNFR-1 recruits the multivalent adapter molecule TRADD, which like FADD, also contains a death domain (H. Hsu et al., Cell 81:495-504 (1995); H. Hsu, et al., Cell 84:299-308 (1996)). Through its associations with a number of signaling molecules including FADD, TRAF2, and RIP, TRADD can signal both apoptosis and NF-kB activation (H. Hsu et al., Cell 84:299-308 (1996); H. Hsu, et al., Immunity 4:387-396 (1996)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0502" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0502&rsqb;</number> Recently, a new apoptosis -inducing TNF ligand has been discovered. S. R. Wiley et al. (Immunity 3:673-682 (1995)) named the molecule&mdash;&igrave;TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand&icirc; or simply &igrave;TRAIL.&icirc; The molecule was also called &igrave;Apo-2 ligand&icirc; or &igrave;Apo-2L.&icirc; R. M. Pitt et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271:12687-12690 (1996). This molecule was also disclosed in co-pending U.S. provisional application No. 60/013,405. For convenience, the molecule will be referred to herein as TRAIL. Unlike FAS ligand, whose transcripts appear to be largely restricted to stimulated T-cells, significant levels of TRAIL are detected in many human tissues (e.g., spleen, lung, prostate, thymus, ovary, small intestine, colon, peripheral blood lymphocytes, placenta, kidney), and is constitutively transcribed by some cell lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0503" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0503&rsqb;</number> It has been shown that TRAIL acts independently from the Fas ligand (Wiley et al., supra). It has also been shown that TRAIL activates apoptosis rapidly, within a time frame that is similar to death signaling by Fas/Apo-1L, but much faster than TNF-induced apoptosis. S. A. Marsters et al., Current Biology 6:750-752 (1996). The inability of TRAIL to bind TNFR-1, Fas, or the recently identified DR3, indicates that TRAIL may interact with a unique receptor(s). Several unique receptors for TRAIL have already been identified. In co-pending U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/035,722, DR4, a novel death domain containing receptor for TRAIL, was disclosed. See, Pan et al., Science 276, 111-113 (April 1997). The TR5 receptor, the subject of co-pending U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/035,496, has now been shown to bind TRAIL. In co-pending U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/xxxxxx, it was predicted that the TR10 receptor would also bind TRAIL, owing to sequence homology with DR4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0504" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0504&rsqb;</number> The effects of TNF family ligands and TNF family receptors are varied and influence numerous functions, both normal and abnormal, in the biological processes of the mammalian system. There is a clear need, therefore, for identification and characterization of such receptors and ligands that influence biological activity, both normally and in disease states. In particular, there is a need to isolate and characterize additional novel receptors that bind to or antagonize TRAIL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0505" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0505&rsqb;</number> This gene is expressed primarily in fetal liver, and to a lesser extent in activated neutrophils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0506" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0506&rsqb;</number> Therefore, polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention are useful as reagents for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s) present in a biological sample and for diagnosis of diseases and conditions which include, but are not limited to, cancer; hematopoietic, developmental, and hepatic disorders and disease. Similarly, polypeptides and antibodies directed to these polypeptides are useful in providing immunological probes for differential identification of the tissue(s) or cell type(s). For a number of disorders of the above tissues or cells, particularly for the immune system and for cancers such as melanomas and ovarian cancers, expression of this gene at significantly higher or lower levels may be routinely detected in certain tissues or cell types (e.g., hepatic, hematopoietic, developmental, and cancerous and wounded tissues) or bodily fluids (e.g., bile, lymph, serum, plasma, amniotic fluid, urine, synovial fluid and spinal fluid) or another tissue or cell sample taken from an individual having such a disorder, relative to the standard gene expression level, i.e., the expression level in healthy tissue or bodily fluid from an individual not having the disorder. </paragraph>

Similarly, developmental tissues rely on decisions involving cell differentiation and/or apoptosis in pattern formation. Dysregulation of apoptosis can result in inappropriate suppression of cell death, as occurs in the development of some cancers, or in failure to control the extent of cell death, as is believed to occur in acquired immunodeficiency and certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Therefore, the polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention are useful in treating, detecting, and/or preventing said disorders and conditions, in addition to other types of degenerative conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0511" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0511&rsqb;</number> Thus this protein may also be involved in the modulation of apoptosis or tissue differentiation and could again be useful in cancer therapy.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0736" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0736&rsqb;</number> Table 1 summarizes the information corresponding to each &ldquo;Gene No.&rdquo; described above. The nucleotide sequence identified as &ldquo;NT SEQ ID NO:X&rdquo; was assembled from partially homologous (&ldquo;overlapping&rdquo;) sequences obtained from the &ldquo;cDNA clone ID&rdquo; identified in Table 1 and, in some cases, from additional related DNA clones. The overlapping sequences were assembled into a single contiguous sequence of high redundancy (usually three to five overlapping sequences at each nucleotide position), resulting in a final sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0737" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0737&rsqb;</number> The cDNA Clone ID was deposited on the date and given the corresponding deposit number listed in &ldquo;ATCC Deposit No:Z and Date.&rdquo; Some of the deposits contain multiple different clones corresponding to the same gene. &ldquo;Vector&rdquo; refers to the type of vector contained in the cDNA Clone ID. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0738" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0738&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Total NT Seq.&rdquo; refers to the total number of nucleotides in the contig identified by &ldquo;Gene No.&rdquo; The deposited clone may contain all or most of these sequences, reflected by the nucleotide position indicated as &ldquo;5&prime; NT of Clone Seq.&rdquo; and the &ldquo;3&prime; NT of Clone Seq.&rdquo; of SEQ ID NO:X. The nucleotide position of SEQ ID NO:X of the putative start codon (methionine) is identified as &ldquo;5&prime; NT of Start Codon.&rdquo; Similarly, the nucleotide position of SEQ ID NO:X of the predicted signal sequence is identified as &ldquo;5&prime; NT of First AA of Signal Pep.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0739" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0739&rsqb;</number> The translated amino acid sequence, beginning with the methionine, is identified as &ldquo;AA SEQ ID NO:Y,&rdquo; although other reading frames can also be easily translated using known molecular biology techniques. The polypeptides produced by these alternative open reading frames are specifically contemplated by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0740" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0740&rsqb;</number> The first and last amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the predicted signal peptide is identified as &ldquo;First AA of Sig Pep&rdquo; and &ldquo;Last AA of Sig Pep.&rdquo; The predicted first amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the secreted portion is identified as &ldquo;Predicted First AA of Secreted Portion.&rdquo; Finally, the amino acid position of SEQ ID NO:Y of the last amino acid in the open reading frame is identified as &ldquo;Last AA of ORF.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0741" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0741&rsqb;</number> SEQ ID NO:X and the translated SEQ ID NO:Y are sufficiently accurate and otherwise suitable for a variety of uses well known in the art and described further below. For instance, SEQ ID NO:X is useful for designing nucleic acid hybridization probes that will detect nucleic acid sequences contained in SEQ ID NO:X or the cDNA contained in the deposited clone. These probes will also hybridize to nucleic acid molecules in biological samples, thereby enabling a variety of forensic and diagnostic methods of the invention. Similarly, polypeptides identified from SEQ ID NO:Y may be used to generate antibodies which bind specifically to the secreted proteins encoded by the cDNA clones identified in Table 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0742" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0742&rsqb;</number> Nevertheless, DNA sequences generated by sequencing reactions can contain sequencing errors. The errors exist as misidentified nucleotides, or as insertions or deletions of nucleotides in the generated DNA sequence. The erroneously inserted or deleted nucleotides cause frame shifts in the reading frames of the predicted amino acid sequence. In these cases, the predicted amino acid sequence diverges from the actual amino acid sequence, even though the generated DNA sequence may be greater than 99.9% identical to the actual DNA sequence (for example, one base insertion or deletion in an open reading frame of over 1000 bases). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0743" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0743&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, for those applications requiring precision in the nucleotide sequence or the amino acid sequence, the present invention provides not only the generated nucleotide sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:X and the predicted translated amino acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO:Y, but also a sample of plasmid DNA containing a human cDNA of the invention deposited with the ATCC, as set forth in Table 1. The nucleotide sequence of each deposited clone can readily be determined by sequencing the deposited clone in accordance with known methods. The predicted amino acid sequence can then be verified from such deposits. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by a particular clone can also be directly determined by peptide sequencing or by expressing the protein in a suitable host cell containing the deposited human cDNA, collecting the protein, and determining its sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0744" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0744&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to the genes corresponding to SEQ ID NO:X, SEQ ID NO:Y, or the deposited clone. The corresponding gene can be isolated in accordance with known methods using the sequence information disclosed herein. Such methods include preparing probes or primers from the disclosed sequence and identifying or amplifying the corresponding gene from appropriate sources of genomic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0745" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0745&rsqb;</number> Also provided in the present invention are species homologs. Species homologs may be isolated and identified by making suitable probes or primers from the sequences provided herein and screening a suitable nucleic acid source for the desired homologue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0746" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0746&rsqb;</number> The polypeptides of the invention can be prepared in any suitable manner. Such polypeptides include isolated naturally occurring polypeptides, recombinantly produced polypeptides, synthetically produced polypeptides, or polypeptides produced by a combination of these methods. Means for preparing such polypeptides are well understood in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0747" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0747&rsqb;</number> The polypeptides may be in the form of the secreted protein, including the mature form, or may be a part of a larger protein, such as a fusion protein (see below). It is often advantageous to include an additional amino acid sequence which contains secretory or leader sequences, pro-sequences, sequences which aid in purification, such as multiple histidine residues, or an additional sequence for stability during recombinant production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0748" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0748&rsqb;</number> The polypeptides of the present invention are preferably provided in an isolated form, and preferably are substantially purified. A recombinantly produced version of a polypeptide, including the secreted polypeptide, can be substantially purified by the one-step method described in Smith and Johnson, Gene 67:31-40 (1988). Polypeptides of the invention also can be purified from natural or recombinant sources using antibodies of the invention raised against the secreted protein in methods which are well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0749" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0749&rsqb;</number> Signal Sequences </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0750" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0750&rsqb;</number> Methods for predicting whether a protein has a signal sequence, as well as the cleavage point for that sequence, are available. For instance, the method of McGeoch, Virus Res. 3:271-286 (1985), uses the information from a short N-terminal charged region and a subsequent uncharged region of the complete (uncleaved) protein. The method of von Heinje, Nucleic Acids Res. 14:4683-4690 (1986) uses the information from the residues surrounding the cleavage site, typically residues &minus;13 to &plus;2, where &plus;1 indicates the amino terminus of the secreted protein. The accuracy of predicting the cleavage points of known mammalian secretory proteins for each of these methods is in the range of 75-80%. (von Heinje, supra.) However, the two methods do not always produce the same predicted cleavage point(s) for a given protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0751" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0751&rsqb;</number> In the present case, the deduced amino acid sequence of the secreted polypeptide was analyzed by a computer program called SignalP (Henrik Nielsen et al., Protein Engineering 10:1-6 (1997)), which predicts the cellular location of a protein based on the amino acid sequence. As part of this computational prediction of localization, the methods of McGeoch and von Heinje are incorporated. The analysis of the amino acid sequences of the secreted proteins described herein by this program provided the results shown in Table 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0752" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0752&rsqb;</number> As one of ordinary skill would appreciate, however, cleavage sites sometimes vary from organism to organism and cannot be predicted with absolute certainty. Accordingly, the present invention provides secreted polypeptides having a sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:Y which have an N-terminus beginning within 5 residues (i.e., &plus; or &minus;5 residues) of the predicted cleavage point. Similarly, it is also recognized that in some cases, cleavage of the signal sequence from a secreted protein is not entirely uniform, resulting in more than one secreted species. These polypeptides, and the polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides, are contemplated by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0753" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0753&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the signal sequence identified by the above analysis may not necessarily predict the naturally occurring signal sequence. For example, the naturally occurring signal sequence may be further upstream from the predicted signal sequence. However, it is likely that the predicted signal sequence will be capable of directing the secreted protein to the ER. These polypeptides, and the polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides, are contemplated by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0754" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0754&rsqb;</number> Polynucleotide and Polypeptide Variants </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0755" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0755&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Variant&rdquo; refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide differing from the polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention, but retaining essential properties thereof. Generally, variants are overall closely similar, and, in many regions, identical to the polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0756" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0756&rsqb;</number> By a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least, for example, 95% &ldquo;identical&rdquo; to a reference nucleotide sequence of the present invention, it is intended that the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polynucleotide sequence may include up to five point mutations per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide. In other words, to obtain a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 95% identical to a reference nucleotide sequence, up to 5% of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide, or a number of nucleotides up to 5% of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. The query sequence may be an entire sequence shown in Table 1, the ORF (open reading frame), or any fragment specified as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0757" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0757&rsqb;</number> As a practical matter, whether any particular nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide is at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a nucleotide sequence of the presence invention can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determing the best overall match between a query sequence (a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. (Comp. App. Biosci. (1990) 6:237-245). In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are both DNA sequences. An RNA sequence can be compared by converting U&apos;s to T&apos;s. The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identiy are: Matrix&equals;Unitary, k-tuple&equals;4, Mismatch Penalty&equals;1, Joining Penalty&equals;30, Randomization Group Length&equals;0, Cutoff Score&equals;1, Gap Penalty&equals;5, Gap Size Penalty 0.05, Window Size&equals;500 or the lenght of the subject nucleotide sequence, whichever is shorter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0758" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0758&rsqb;</number> If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of 5&prime; or 3&prime; deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction must be made to the results. This is because the FASTDB program does not account for 5&prime; and 3&prime; truncations of the subject sequence when calculating percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the 5&prime; or 3&prime; ends, relative to the the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of bases of the query sequence that are 5&prime; and 3&prime; of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a nucleotide is matched/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This corrected score is what is used for the purposes of the present invention. Only bases outside the 5&prime; and 3&prime; bases of the subject sequence, as displayed by the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence, are calculated for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0759" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0759&rsqb;</number> For example, a 90 base subject sequence is aligned to a 100 base query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletions occur at the 5&prime; end of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matched/alignment of the first 10 bases at 5&prime; end. The 10 unpaired bases represent 10% of the sequence (number of bases at the 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends not matched/total number of bases in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 bases were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 base subject sequence is compared with a 100 base query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so that there are no bases on the 5&prime; or 3&prime; of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only bases 5&prime; and 3&prime; of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are to made for the purposes of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0760" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0760&rsqb;</number> By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least, for example, 95% &ldquo;identical&rdquo; to a query amino acid sequence of the present invention, it is intended that the amino acid sequence of the subject polypeptide is identical to the query sequence except that the subject polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the query amino acid sequence. In other words, to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a query amino acid sequence, up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the subject sequence may be inserted, deleted, (indels) or substituted with another amino acid. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0761" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0761&rsqb;</number> As a practical matter, whether any particular polypeptide is at least 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to, for instance, the amino acid sequences shown in Table 1 or to the amino acid sequence encoded by deposited DNA clone can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determing the best overall match between a query sequence (a sequence of the present invention) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. (Comp. App. Biosci. (1990) 6:237-245). In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are either both nucleotide sequences or both amino acid sequences. The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment are: Matrix&equals;PAM 0, k-tuple&equals;2, Mismatch Penalty&equals;1, Joining Penalty&equals;20, Randomization Group Length&equals;0, Cutoff Score&equals;1, Window Size&equals;sequence length, Gap Penalty&equals;5, Gap Size Penalty&equals;0.05, Window Size&equals;500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence, whichever is shorter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0762" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0762&rsqb;</number> If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to N- or C-terminal deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction must be made to the results. This is becuase the FASTDB program does not account for N- and C-terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N- and C-termini, relative to the the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N- and C-terminal of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned with a corresponding subject residue, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a residue is matched/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of the present invention. Only residues to the N- and C-termini of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence, are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is, only query residue positions outside the farthest N- and C-terminal residues of the subject sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0763" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0763&rsqb;</number> For example, a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100 residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N-terminus of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matching/alignment of the first 10 residues at the N-terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10% of the sequence (number of residues at the N- and C-termini not matched/total number of residues in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N- or C-termini of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only residue positions outside the N- and C-terminal ends of the subject sequence, as displayed in the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are to made for the purposes of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0764" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0764&rsqb;</number> The variants may contain alterations in the coding regions, non-coding regions, or both. Especially preferred are polynucleotide variants containing alterations which produce silent substitutions, additions, or deletions, but do not alter the properties or activities of the encoded polypeptide. Nucleotide variants produced by silent substitutions due to the degeneracy of the genetic code are preferred. Moreover, variants in which 5-10, 1-5, or 1-2 amino acids are substituted, deleted, or added in any combination are also preferred. Polynucleotide variants can be produced for a variety of reasons, e.g., to optimize codon expression for a particular host (change codons in the human mRNA to those preferred by a bacterial host such as <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0765" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0765&rsqb;</number> Naturally occurring variants are called &ldquo;allelic variants,&rdquo; and refer to one of several alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome of an organism. (Genes II, Lewin, B., ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1985).) These allelic variants can vary at either the polynucleotide and/or polypeptide level. Alternatively, non-naturally occurring variants may be produced by mutagenesis techniques or by direct synthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0766" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0766&rsqb;</number> Using known methods of protein engineering and recombinant DNA technology, variants may be generated to improve or alter the characteristics of the polypeptides of the present invention. For instance, one or more amino acids can be deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus of the secreted protein without substantial loss of biological function. The authors of Ron et al., J. Biol. Chem. 268: 2984-2988 (1993), reported variant KGF proteins having heparin binding activity even after deleting 3, 8, or 27 amino-terminal amino acid residues. Similarly, Interferon gamma exhibited up to ten times higher activity after deleting 8-10 amino acid residues from the carboxy terminus of this protein. (Dobeli et al., J. Biotechnology 7:199-216 (1988).) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0767" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0767&rsqb;</number> Moreover, ample evidence demonstrates that variants often retain a biological activity similar to that of the naturally occurring protein. For example, Gayle and coworkers (J. Biol. Chem 268:22105-22111 (1993)) conducted extensive mutational analysis of human cytokine IL-1a. They used random mutagenesis to generate over 3,500 individual IL-1a mutants that averaged 2.5 amino acid changes per variant over the entire length of the molecule. Multiple mutations were examined at every possible amino acid position. The investigators found that &ldquo;&lsqb;m&rsqb;ost of the molecule could be altered with little effect on either &lsqb;binding or biological activity&rsqb;.&rdquo; (See, Abstract.) In fact, only 23 unique amino acid sequences, out of more than 3,500 nucleotide sequences examined, produced a protein that significantly differed in activity from wild-type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0768" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0768&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, even if deleting one or more amino acids from the N-terminus or C-terminus of a polypeptide results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions, other biological activities may still be retained. For example, the ability of a deletion variant to induce and/or to bind antibodies which recognize the secreted form will likely be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the secreted form are removed from the N-terminus or C-terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N- or C-terminal residues of a protein retains such immunogenic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0769" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0769&rsqb;</number> Thus, the invention further includes polypeptide variants which show substantial biological activity. Such variants include deletions, insertions, inversions, repeats, and substitutions selected according to general rules known in the art so as have little effect on activity. For example, guidance concerning how to make phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions is provided in Bowie, J. U. et al., Science 247:1306-1310 (1990), wherein the authors indicate that there are two main strategies for studying the tolerance of an amino acid sequence to change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0770" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0770&rsqb;</number> The first strategy exploits the tolerance of amino acid substitutions by natural selection during the process of evolution. By comparing amino acid sequences in different species, conserved amino acids can be identified. These conserved amino acids are likely important for protein function. In contrast, the amino acid positions where substitutions have been tolerated by natural selection indicates that these positions are not critical for protein function. Thus, positions tolerating amino acid substitution could be modified while still maintaining biological activity of the protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0771" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0771&rsqb;</number> The second strategy uses genetic engineering to introduce amino acid changes at specific positions of a cloned gene to identify regions critical for protein function. For example, site directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (introduction of single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule) can be used. (Cunningham and Wells, Science 244:1081-1085 (1989).) The resulting mutant molecules can then be tested for biological activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0772" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0772&rsqb;</number> As the authors state, these two strategies have revealed that proteins are surprisingly tolerant of amino acid substitutions. The authors further indicate which amino acid changes are likely to be permissive at certain amino acid positions in the protein. For example, most buried (within the tertiary structure of the protein) amino acid residues require nonpolar side chains, whereas few features of surface side chains are generally conserved. Moreover, tolerated conservative amino acid substitutions involve replacement of the aliphatic or hydrophobic amino acids Ala, Val, Leu and Ile; replacement of the hydroxyl residues Ser and Thr; replacement of the acidic residues Asp and Glu; replacement of the amide residues Asn and Gln, replacement of the basic residues Lys, Arg, and His; replacement of the aromatic residues Phe, Tyr, and Trp, and replacement of the small-sized amino acids Ala, Ser, Thr, Met, and Gly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0773" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0773&rsqb;</number> Besides conservative amino acid substitution, variants of the present invention include (i) substitutions with one or more of the non-conserved amino acid residues, where the substituted amino acid residues may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code, or (ii) substitution with one or more of amino acid residues having a substituent group, or (iii) fusion of the mature polypeptide with another compound, such as a compound to increase the stability and/or solubility of the polypeptide (for example, polyethylene glycol), or (iv) fusion of the polypeptide with additional amino acids, such as an IgG Fc fusion region peptide, or leader or secretory sequence, or a sequence facilitating purification. Such variant polypeptides are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0774" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0774&rsqb;</number> For example, polypeptide variants containing amino acid substitutions of charged amino acids with other charged or neutral amino acids may produce proteins with improved characteristics, such as less aggregation. Aggregation of pharmaceutical formulations both reduces activity and increases clearance due to the aggregate&apos;s immunogenic activity. (Pinckard et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2:331-340 (1967); Robbins et al., Diabetes 36: 838-845 (1987); Cleland et al., Crit. Rev. Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems 10:307-377 (1993).) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0775" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0775&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment of the invention relates to a polypeptide which comprises the amino acid sequence of the present invention having an amino acid sequence which contains at least one amino acid substitution, but not more than 50 amino acid substitutions, even more preferably, not more than 40 amino acid substitutions, still more preferably, not more than 30 amino acid substitutions, and still even more preferably, not more than 20 amino acid substitutions. Of course, in order of ever-increasing preference, it is highly preferable for a polypeptide to have an amino acid sequence which comprises the amino acid sequence of the present invention, which contains at least one, but not more than 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 amino acid substitutions. In specific embodiments, the number of additions, substitutions, and/or deletions in the amino acid sequence of the present invention or fragments thereof (e.g., the mature form and/or other fragments described herein), is 1-5, 5-10, 5-25, 5-50, 10-50 or 50-150, conservative amino acid substitutions are preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0776" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0776&rsqb;</number> Polynucleotide and Polypeptide Fragments </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0777" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0777&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, a &ldquo;polynucleotide fragment&rdquo; refers to a short polynucleotide having a nucleic acid sequence contained in the deposited clone or shown in SEQ ID NO:X. The short nucleotide fragments are preferably at least about 15 nt, and more preferably at least about 20 nt, still more preferably at least about 30 nt, and even more preferably, at least about 40 nt in length. A fragment &ldquo;at least 20 nt in length,&rdquo; for example, is intended to include 20 or more contiguous bases from the cDNA sequence contained in the deposited clone or the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:X. These nucleotide fragments are useful as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed herein. Of course, larger fragments (e.g., 50, 150, 500, 600, 2000 nucleotides) are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0778" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0778&rsqb;</number> Moreover, representative examples of polynucleotide fragments of the invention, include, for example, fragments having a sequence from about nucleotide number 1-50, 51-100, 101-150, 151-200, 201-250, 251-300, 301-350, 351-400, 401-450, 451-500, 501-550, 551-600, 651-700, 701-750, 751-800, 800-850, 851-900, 901-950, 951-1000, 1001-1050, 1051-1100, 1101-1150, 1151-1200, 1201-1250, 1251-1300, 1301-1350, 1351-1400, 1401-1450, 1451-1500, 1501-1550, 1551-1600, 1601-1650, 1651-1700, 1701-1750, 1751-1800, 1801-1850, 1851-1900, 1901-1950, 1951-2000, or 2001 to the end of SEQ ID NO:X or the cDNA contained in the deposited clone. In this context &ldquo;about&rdquo; includes the particularly recited ranges, larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) nucleotides, at either terminus or at both termini. Preferably, these fragments encode a polypeptide which has biological activity. More preferably, these polynucleotides can be used as probes or primers as discussed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0779" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0779&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, a &ldquo;polypeptide fragment&rdquo; refers to a short amino acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO:Y or encoded by the cDNA contained in the deposited clone. Protein fragments may be &ldquo;free-standing,&rdquo; or comprised within a larger polypeptide of which the fragment forms a part or region, most preferably as a single continuous region. Representative examples of polypeptide fragments of the invention, include, for example, fragments from about amino acid number 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-80, 81-100, 102-120, 121-140, 141-160, or 161 to the end of the coding region. Moreover, polypeptide fragments can be about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, or 150 amino acids in length. In this context &ldquo;about&rdquo; includes the particularly recited ranges, larger or smaller by several (5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) amino acids, at either extreme or at both extremes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0780" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0780&rsqb;</number> Preferred polypeptide fragments include the secreted protein as well as the mature form. Further preferred polypeptide fragments include the secreted protein or the mature form having a continuous series of deleted residues from the amino or the carboxy terminus, or both. For example, any number of amino acids, ranging from 1-60, can be deleted from the amino terminus of either the secreted polypeptide or the mature form. Similarly, any number of amino acids, ranging from 1-30, can be deleted from the carboxy terminus of the secreted protein or mature form. Furthermore, any combination of the above amino and carboxy terminus deletions are preferred. Similarly, polynucleotide fragments encoding these polypeptide fragments are also preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0781" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0781&rsqb;</number> Also preferred are polypeptide and polynucleotide fragments characterized by structural or functional domains, such as fragments that comprise alpha-helix and alpha-helix forming regions, beta-sheet and beta-sheet-forming regions, turn and turn-forming regions, coil and coil-forming regions, hydrophilic regions, hydrophobic regions, alpha amphipathic regions, beta amphipathic regions, flexible regions, surface-forming regions, substrate binding region, and high antigenic index regions. Polypeptide fragments of SEQ ID NO:Y falling within conserved domains are specifically contemplated by the present invention. Moreover, polynucleotide fragments encoding these domains are also contemplated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0782" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0782&rsqb;</number> Other preferred fragments are biologically active fragments. Biologically active fragments are those exhibiting activity similar, but not necessarily identical, to an activity of the polypeptide of the present invention. The biological activity of the fragments may include an improved desired activity, or a decreased undesirable activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0783" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0783&rsqb;</number> Epitopes &amp; Antibodies </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0784" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0784&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, &ldquo;epitopes&rdquo; refer to polypeptide fragments having antigenic or immunogenic activity in an animal, especially in a human. A preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to a polypeptide fragment comprising an epitope, as well as the polynucleotide encoding this fragment. A region of a protein molecule to which an antibody can bind is defined as an &ldquo;antigenic epitope.&rdquo; In contrast, an &ldquo;immunogenic epitope&rdquo; is defined as a part of a protein that elicits an antibody response. (See, for instance, Geysen et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3998-4002 (1983).) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0785" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0785&rsqb;</number> Fragments which function as epitopes may be produced by any conventional means. (See, e.g., Houghten, R. A., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:5131-5135 (1985) further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,211.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0786" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0786&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, antigenic epitopes preferably contain a sequence of at least seven, more preferably at least nine, and most preferably between about 15 to about 30 amino acids. Antigenic epitopes are useful to raise antibodies, including monoclonal antibodies, that specifically bind the epitope. (See, for instance, Wilson et al., Cell 37:767-778 (1984); Sutcliffe, J. G. et al., Science 219:660-666 (1983).) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0787" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0787&rsqb;</number> Similarly, immunogenic epitopes can be used to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art. (See, for instance, Sutcliffe et al., supra; Wilson et al., supra; Chow, M. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:910-914; and Bittle, F. J. et al., J. Gen. Virol. 66:2347-2354 (1985).) A preferred immunogenic epitope includes the secreted protein. The immunogenic epitopes may be presented together with a carrier protein, such as an albumin, to an animal system (such as rabbit or mouse) or, if it is long enough (at least about 25 amino acids), without a carrier. However, immunogenic epitopes comprising as few as 8 to 10 amino acids have been shown to be sufficient to raise antibodies capable of binding to, at the very least, linear epitopes in a denatured polypeptide (e.g., in Western blotting.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0788" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0788&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;antibody&rdquo; (Ab) or &ldquo;monoclonal antibody&rdquo; (Mab) is meant to include intact molecules as well as antibody fragments (such as, for example, Fab and F(ab&prime;)2 fragments) which are capable of specifically binding to protein. Fab and F(ab&prime;)2 fragments lack the Fc fragment of intact antibody, clear more rapidly from the circulation, and may have less non-specific tissue binding than an intact antibody. (Wahl et al., J. Nucl. Med. 24:316-325 (1983).) Thus, these fragments are preferred, as well as the products of a FAB or other immunoglobulin expression library. Moreover, antibodies of the present invention include chimeric, single chain, and humanized antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0789" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0789&rsqb;</number> Fusion Proteins </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0790" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0790&rsqb;</number> Any polypeptide of the present invention can be used to generate fusion proteins. For example, the polypeptide of the present invention, when fused to a second protein, can be used as an antigenic tag. Antibodies raised against the polypeptide of the present invention can be used to indirectly detect the second protein by binding to the polypeptide. Moreover, because secreted proteins target cellular locations based on trafficking signals, the polypeptides of the present invention can be used as targeting molecules once fused to other proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0791" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0791&rsqb;</number> Examples of domains that can be fused to polypeptides of the present invention include not only heterologous signal sequences, but also other heterologous functional regions. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct, but may occur through linker sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0792" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0792&rsqb;</number> Moreover, fusion proteins may also be engineered to improve characteristics of the polypeptide of the present invention. For instance, a region of additional amino acids, particularly charged amino acids, may be added to the N-terminus of the polypeptide to improve stability and persistence during purification from the host cell or subsequent handling and storage. Also, peptide moieties may be added to the polypeptide to facilitate purification. Such regions may be removed prior to final preparation of the polypeptide. The addition of peptide moieties to facilitate handling of polypeptides are familiar and routine techniques in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0793" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0793&rsqb;</number> Moreover, polypeptides of the present invention, including fragments, and specifically epitopes, can be combined with parts of the constant domain of immunoglobulins (IgG), resulting in chimeric polypeptides. These fusion proteins facilitate purification and show an increased half-life in vivo. One reported example describes chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4-polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. (EP A 394,827; Traunecker et al., Nature 331:84-86 (1988).) Fusion proteins having disulfide-linked dimeric structures (due to the IgG) can also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules, than the monomeric secreted protein or protein fragment alone. (Fountoulakis et al., J. Biochem. 270:3958-3964 (1995).) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0794" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0794&rsqb;</number> Similarly, EP-A-O 464 533 (Canadian counterpart 2045869) discloses fusion proteins comprising various portions of constant region of immunoglobulin molecules together with another human protein or part thereof. In many cases, the Fc part in a fusion protein is beneficial in therapy and diagnosis, and thus can result in, for example, improved pharmacokinetic properties. (EP-A 0232 262.) Alternatively, deleting the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed, detected, and purified, would be desired. For example, the Fc portion may hinder therapy and diagnosis if the fusion protein is used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery, for example, human proteins, such as hIL-5, have been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high-throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL-5. (See, D. Bennett et al., J. Molecular Recognition 8:52-58 (1995); K. Johanson et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:9459-9471 (1995).) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0795" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0795&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the polypeptides of the present invention can be fused to marker sequences, such as a peptide which facilitates purification of the fused polypeptide. In preferred embodiments, the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, such as the tag provided in a pQE vector (QIAGEN, Inc., 9259 Eton Avenue, Chatsworth, Calif., 91311), among others, many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:821-824 (1989), for instance, hexa-histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Another peptide tag useful for purification, the &ldquo;HA&rdquo; tag, corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein. (Wilson et al., Cell 37:767 (1984).) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0796" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0796&rsqb;</number> Thus, any of these above fusions can be engineered using the polynucleotides or the polypeptides of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0797" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0797&rsqb;</number> Vectors, Host Cells, and Protein Production </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0798" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0798&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to vectors containing the polynucleotide of the present invention, host cells, and the production of polypeptides by recombinant techniques. The vector may be, for example, a phage, plasmid, viral, or retroviral vector. Retroviral vectors may be replication competent or replication defective. In the latter case, viral propagation generally will occur only in complementing host cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0799" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0799&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotides may be joined to a vector containing a selectable marker for propagation in a host. Generally, a plasmid vector is introduced in a precipitate, such as a calcium phosphate precipitate, or in a complex with a charged lipid. If the vector is a virus, it may be packaged in vitro using an appropriate packaging cell line and then transduced into host cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0800" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0800&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotide insert should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter, such as the phage lambda PL promoter, the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>lac, trp, phoA and tac promoters, the SV40 early and late promoters and promoters of retroviral LTRs, to name a few. Other suitable promoters will be known to the skilled artisan. The expression constructs will further contain sites for transcription initiation, termination, and, in the transcribed region, a ribosome binding site for translation. The coding portion of the transcripts expressed by the constructs will preferably include a translation initiating codon at the beginning and a termination codon (UAA, UGA or UAG) appropriately positioned at the end of the polypeptide to be translated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0801" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0801&rsqb;</number> As indicated, the expression vectors will preferably include at least one selectable marker. Such markers include dihydrofolate reductase, G418 or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture and tetracycline, kanamycin or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and other bacteria. Representative examples of appropriate hosts include, but are not limited to, bacterial cells, such as <highlight><italic>E. coli, </italic></highlight>Streptomyces and <highlight><italic>Salmonella typhimurium </italic></highlight>cells; fungal cells, such as yeast cells; insect cells such as Drosophila S2 and Spodoptera Sf9 cells; animal cells such as CHO, COS, 293, and Bowes melanoma cells; and plant cells. Appropriate culture mediums and conditions for the above-described host cells are known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0802" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0802&rsqb;</number> Among vectors preferred for use in bacteria include pQE70, pQE60 and pQE-9, available from QIAGEN, Inc.; pBluescript vectors, Phagescript vectors, pNH8A, pNH16a, pNH18A, pNH46A, available from Stratagene Cloning Systems, Inc.; and ptrc99a, pKK223-3, pKK233-3, pDR540, pRIT5 available from Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. Among preferred eukaryotic vectors are pWLNEO, pSV2CAT, pOG44, pXT1 and pSG available from Stratagene; and pSVK3, pBPV, pMSG and pSVL available from Pharmacia. Other suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0803" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0803&rsqb;</number> Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, transduction, infection, or other methods. Such methods are described in many standard laboratory manuals, such as Davis et al., Basic Methods In Molecular Biology (1986). It is specifically contemplated that the polypeptides of the present invention may in fact be expressed by a host cell lacking a recombinant vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0804" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0804&rsqb;</number> A polypeptide of this invention can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by well-known methods including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. Most preferably, high performance liquid chromatography (&ldquo;HPLC&rdquo;) is employed for purification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0805" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0805&rsqb;</number> Polypeptides of the present invention, and preferably the secreted form, can also be recovered from: products purified from natural sources, including bodily fluids, tissues and cells, whether directly isolated or cultured; products of chemical synthetic procedures; and products produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host, including, for example, bacterial, yeast, higher plant, insect, and mammalian cells. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure, the polypeptides of the present invention may be glycosylated or may be non-glycosylated. In addition, polypeptides of the invention may also include an initial modified methionine residue, in some cases as a result of host-mediated processes. Thus, it is well known in the art that the N-terminal methionine encoded by the translation initiation codon generally is removed with high efficiency from any protein after translation in all eukaryotic cells. While the N-terminal methionine on most proteins also is efficiently removed in most prokaryotes, for some proteins, this prokaryotic removal process is inefficient, depending on the nature of the amino acid to which the N-terminal methionine is covalently linked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0806" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0806&rsqb;</number> In addition to encompassing host cells containing the vector constructs discussed herein, the invention also encompasses primary, secondary, and immortalized host cells of vertebrate origin, particularly mammalian origin, that have been engineered to delete or replace endogenous genetic material (e.g., coding sequence), and/or to include genetic material (e.g., heterologous polynucleotide sequences) that is operably associated with the polynucleotides of the invention, and which activates, alters, and/or amplifies endogenous polynucleotides. For example, techniques known in the art may be used to operably associate heterologous control regions (e.g., promoter and/or enhancer) and endogenous polynucleotide sequences via homologous recombination (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,670, issued Jun. 24, 1997; International Publication No. WO 96/29411, published Sep. 26, 1996; International Publication No. WO 94/12650, published Aug. 4, 1994; Koller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:8932-8935 (1989); and Zijlstra et al., Nature 342:435-438 (1989), the disclosures of each of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0807" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0807&rsqb;</number> Uses of the Polynucleotides </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0808" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0808&rsqb;</number> Each of the polynucleotides identified herein can be used in numerous ways as reagents. The following description should be considered exemplary and utilizes known techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0809" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0809&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotides of the present invention are useful for chrorhosome identification. There exists an ongoing need to identify new chromosome markers, since few chromosome marking reagents, based on actual sequence data (repeat polymorphisms), are presently available. Each polynucleotide of the present invention can be used as a chromosome marker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0810" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0810&rsqb;</number> Briefly, sequences can be mapped to chromosomes by preparing PCR primers (preferably 15-25 bp) from the sequences shown in SEQ ID NO:X. Primers can be selected using computer analysis so that primers do not span more than one predicted exon in the genomic DNA. These primers are then used for PCR screening of somatic cell hybrids containing individual human chromosomes. Only those hybrids containing the human gene corresponding to the SEQ ID NO:X will yield an amplified fragment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0811" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0811&rsqb;</number> Similarly, somatic hybrids provide a rapid method of PCR mapping the polynucleotides to particular chromosomes. Three or more clones can be assigned per day using a single thermal cycler. Moreover, sublocalization of the polynucleotides can be achieved with panels of specific chromosome fragments. Other gene mapping strategies that can be used include in situ hybridization, prescreening with labeled flow-sorted chromosomes, and preselection by hybridization to construct chromosome specific-cDNA libraries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0812" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0812&rsqb;</number> Precise chromosomal location of the polynucleotides can also be achieved using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of a metaphase chromosomal spread. This technique uses polynucleotides as short as 500 or 600 bases; however, polynucleotides 2,000-4,000 bp are preferred. For a review of this technique, see Verma et al., &ldquo;Human Chromosomes: a Manual of Basic Techniques,&rdquo; Pergamon Press, New York (1988). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0813" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0813&rsqb;</number> For chromosome mapping, the polynucleotides can be used individually (to mark a single chromosome or a single site on that chromosome) or in panels (for marking multiple sites and/or multiple chromosomes). Preferred polynucleotides correspond to the noncoding regions of the cDNAs because the coding sequences are more likely conserved within gene families, thus increasing the chance of cross hybridization during chromosomal mapping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0814" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0814&rsqb;</number> Once a polynucleotide has been mapped to a precise chromosomal location, the physical position of the polynucleotide can be used in linkage analysis. Linkage analysis establishes coinheritance between a chromosomal location and presentation of a particular disease. (Disease mapping data are found, for example, in V. McKusick, Mendelian Inheritance in Man (available on line through Johns Hopkins University Welch Medical Library).) Assuming 1 megabase mapping resolution and one gene per 20 kb, a cDNA precisely localized to a chromosomal region associated with the disease could be one of 50-500 potential causative genes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0815" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0815&rsqb;</number> Thus, once coinheritance is established, differences in the polynucleotide and the corresponding gene between affected and unaffected individuals can be examined. First, visible structural alterations in the chromosomes, such as deletions or translocations, are examined in chromosome spreads or by PCR. If no structural alterations exist, the presence of point mutations are ascertained. Mutations observed in some or all affected individuals, but not in normal individuals, indicates that the mutation may cause the disease. However, complete sequencing of the polypeptide and the corresponding gene from several normal individuals is required to distinguish the mutation from a polymorphism. If a new polymorphism is identified, this polymorphic polypeptide can be used for further linkage analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0816" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0816&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, increased or decreased expression of the gene in affected individuals as compared to unaffected individuals can be assessed using polynucleotides of the present invention. Any of these alterations (altered expression, chromosomal rearrangement, or mutation) can be used as a diagnostic or prognostic marker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0817" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0817&rsqb;</number> In addition to the foregoing, a polynucleotide can be used to control gene expression through triple helix formation or antisense DNA or RNA. Both methods rely on binding of the polynucleotide to DNA or RNA. For these techniques, preferred polynucleotides are usually 20 to 40 bases in length and complementary to either the region of the gene involved in transcription (triple helix&mdash;see Lee et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 6:3073 (1979); Cooney et al., Science 241:456 (1988); and Dervan et al., Science 251:1360 (1991) ) or to the mRNA itself (antisense&mdash;Okano, J. Neurochem. 56:560 (1991); Oligodeoxy-nucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla. (1988).) Triple helix formation optimally results in a shut-off of RNA transcription from DNA, while antisense RNA hybridization blocks translation of an mRNA molecule into polypeptide. Both techniques are effective in model systems, and the information disclosed herein can be used to design antisense or triple helix polynucleotides in an effort to treat disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0818" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0818&rsqb;</number> Polynucleotides of the present invention are also useful in gene therapy. One goal of gene therapy is to insert a normal gene into an organism having a defective gene, in an effort to correct the genetic defect. The polynucleotides disclosed in the present invention offer a means of targeting such genetic defects in a highly accurate manner. Another goal is to insert a new gene that was not present in the host genome, thereby producing a new trait in the host cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0819" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0819&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotides are also useful for identifying individuals from minute biological samples. The United States military, for example, is considering the use of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for identification of its personnel. In this technique, an individual&apos;s genomic DNA is digested with one or more restriction enzymes, and probed on a Southern blot to yield unique bands for identifying personnel. This method does not suffer from the current limitations of &ldquo;Dog Tags&rdquo; which can be lost, switched, or stolen, making positive identification difficult. The polynucleotides of the present invention can be used as additional DNA markers for RFLP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0820" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0820&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotides of the present invention can also be used as an alternative to RFLP, by determining the actual base-by-base DNA sequence of selected portions of an individual&apos;s genome. These sequences can be used to prepare PCR primers for amplifying and isolating such selected DNA, which can then be sequenced. Using this technique, individuals can be identified because each individual will have a unique set of DNA sequences. Once an unique ID database is established for an individual, positive identification of that individual, living or dead, can be made from extremely small tissue samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0821" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0821&rsqb;</number> Forensic biology also benefits from using DNA-based identification techniques as disclosed herein. DNA sequences taken from very small biological samples such as tissues, e.g., hair or skin, or body fluids, e.g., blood, saliva, semen, etc., can be amplified using PCR. In one prior art technique, gene sequences amplified from polymorphic loci, such as DQa class II HLA gene, are used in forensic biology to identify individuals. (Erlich, H., PCR Technology, Freeman and Co. (1992).) Once these specific polymorphic loci are amplified, they are digested with one or more restriction enzymes, yielding an identifying set of bands on a Southern blot probed with DNA corresponding to the DQa class II HLA gene. Similarly, polynucleotides of the present invention can be used as polymorphic markers for forensic purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0822" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0822&rsqb;</number> There is also a need for reagents capable of identifying the source of a particular tissue. Such need arises, for example, in forensics when presented with tissue of unknown origin. Appropriate reagents can comprise, for example, DNA probes or primers specific to particular tissue prepared from the sequences of the present invention. Panels of such reagents can identify tissue by species and/or by organ type. In a similar fashion, these reagents can be used to screen tissue cultures for contamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0823" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0823&rsqb;</number> In the very least, the polynucleotides of the present invention can be used as molecular weight markers on Southern gels, as diagnostic probes for the presence of a specific mRNA in a particular cell type, as a probe to &ldquo;subtract-out&rdquo; known sequences in the process of discovering novel polynucleotides, for selecting and making oligomers for attachment to a &ldquo;gene chip&rdquo; or other support, to raise anti-DNA antibodies using DNA immunization techniques, and as an antigen to elicit an immune response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0824" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0824&rsqb;</number> Uses of the Polypeptides </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0825" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0825&rsqb;</number> Each of the polypeptides identified herein can be used in numerous ways. The following description should be considered exemplary and utilizes known techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0826" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0826&rsqb;</number> A polypeptide of the present invention can be used to assay protein levels in a biological sample using antibody-based techniques. For example, protein expression in tissues can be studied with classical immunohistological methods. (Jalkanen, M., et al., J. Cell. Biol. 101:976-985 (1985); Jalkanen, M., et al., J. Cell. Biol. 105:3087-3096 (1987).) Other antibody-based methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays, such as the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the radioimmunoassay (RIA). Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels, such as, glucose oxidase, and radioisotopes, such as iodine (125I, 121I), carbon (14C), sulfur (35S), tritium (3H), indium (112In), and technetium (99mTc), and fluorescent labels, such as fluorescein and rhodamine, and biotin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0827" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0827&rsqb;</number> In addition to assaying secreted protein levels in a biological sample, proteins can also be detected in vivo by imaging. Antibody labels or markers for in vivo imaging of protein include those detectable by X-radiography, NMR or ESR. For X-radiography, suitable labels include radioisotopes such as barium or cesium, which emit detectable radiation but are not overtly harmful to the subject. Suitable markers for NMR and ESR include those with a detectable characteristic spin, such as deuterium, which may be incorporated into the antibody by labeling of nutrients for the relevant hybridoma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0828" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0828&rsqb;</number> A protein-specific antibody or antibody fragment which has been labeled with an appropriate detectable imaging moiety, such as a radioisotope (for example, 131I, 112In, 99mTc), a radio-opaque substance, or a material detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance, is introduced (for example, parenterally, subcutaneously, or intraperitoneally) into the mammal. It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety, for a human subject, the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of 99mTc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al., &ldquo;Immunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments.&rdquo; (Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging: The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer, S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes, eds., Masson Publishing Inc. (1982).) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0829" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0829&rsqb;</number> Thus, the invention provides a diagnostic method of a disorder, which involves (a) assaying the expression of a polypeptide of the present invention in cells or body fluid of an individual; (b) comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level, whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of a disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0830" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0830&rsqb;</number> Moreover, polypeptides of the present invention can be used to treat disease. For example, patients can be administered a polypeptide of the present invention in an effort to replace absent or decreased levels of the polypeptide (e.g., insulin), to supplement absent or decreased levels of a different polypeptide (e.g., hemoglobin S for hemoglobin B), to inhibit the activity of a polypeptide (e.g., an oncogene), to activate the activity of a polypeptide (e.g., by binding to a receptor), to reduce the activity of a membrane bound receptor by competing with it for free ligand (e.g., soluble TNF receptors used in reducing inflammation), or to bring about a desired response (e.g., blood vessel growth). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0831" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0831&rsqb;</number> Similarly, antibodies directed to a polypeptide of the present invention can also be used to treat disease. For example, administration of an antibody directed to a polypeptide of the present invention can bind and reduce overproduction of the polypeptide. Similarly, administration of an antibody can activate the polypeptide, such as by binding to a polypeptide bound to a membrane (receptor). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0832" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0832&rsqb;</number> At the very least, the polypeptides of the present invention can be used as molecular weight markers on SDS-PAGE gels or on molecular sieve gel filtration columns using methods well known to those of skill in the art. Polypeptides can also be used to raise antibodies, which in turn are used to measure protein expression from a recombinant cell, as a way of assessing transformation of the host cell. Moreover, the polypeptides of the present invention can be used to test the following biological activities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0833" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0833&rsqb;</number> Biological Activities </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0834" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0834&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention can be used in assays to test for one or more biological activities. If these polynucleotides and polypeptides do exhibit activity in a particular assay, it is likely that these molecules may be involved in the diseases associated with the biological activity. Thus, the polynucleotides and polypeptides could be used to treat the associated disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0835" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0835&rsqb;</number> Immune Activity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0836" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0836&rsqb;</number> A polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention may be useful in treating deficiencies or disorders of the immune system, by activating or inhibiting the proliferation, differentiation, or mobilization (chemotaxis) of immune cells. Immune cells develop through a process called hematopoiesis, producing myeloid (platelets, red blood cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) and lymphoid (B and T lymphocytes) cells from pluripotent stem cells. The etiology of these immune deficiencies or disorders may be genetic, somatic, such as cancer or some autoimmune disorders, acquired (e.g., by chemotherapy or toxins), or infectious. Moreover, a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention can be used as a marker or detector of a particular immune system disease or disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0837" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0837&rsqb;</number> A polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention may be useful in treating or detecting deficiencies or disorders of hematopoietic cells. A polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention could be used to increase differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells, including the pluripotent stem cells, in an effort to treat those disorders associated with a decrease in certain (or many) types hematopoietic cells. Examples of immunologic deficiency syndromes include, but are not limited to: blood protein disorders (e.g. agammaglobulinemia, dysgammaglobulinemia), ataxia telangiectasia, common variable immunodeficiency, Digeorge Syndrome, HIV infection, HTLV-BLV infection, leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome, lymphopenia, phagocyte bactericidal dysfunction, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCIDs), Wiskott-Aldrich Disorder, anemia, thrombocytopenia, or hemoglobinuria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0838" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0838&rsqb;</number> Moreover, a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention could also be used to modulate hemostatic (the stopping of bleeding) or thrombolytic activity (clot formation). For example, by increasing hemostatic or thrombolytic activity, a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention could be used to treat blood coagulation disorders (e.g., afibrinogenemia, factor deficiencies), blood platelet disorders (e.g. thrombocytopenia), or wounds resulting from trauma, surgery, or other causes. Alternatively, a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention that can decrease hemostatic or thrombolytic activity could be used to inhibit or dissolve clotting. These molecules could be important in the treatment of heart attacks (infarction), strokes, or scarring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0839" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0839&rsqb;</number> A polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention may also be useful in treating or detecting autoimmune disorders. Many autoimmune disorders result from inappropriate recognition of self as foreign material by immune cells. This inappropriate recognition results in an immune response leading to the destruction of the host tissue. Therefore, the administration of a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention that inhibits an immune response, particularly the proliferation, differentiation, or chemotaxis of T-cells, may be an effective therapy in preventing autoimmune disorders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0840" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0840&rsqb;</number> Examples of autoimmune disorders that can be treated or detected by the present invention include, but are not limited to: Addison&apos;s Disease, hemolytic anemia, antiphospholipid syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatitis, allergic encephalomyelitis, glomerulonephritis, Goodpasture&apos;s Syndrome, Graves&apos; Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Myasthenia Gravis, Neuritis, Ophthalmia, Bullous Pemphigoid, Pemphigus, Polyendocrinopathies, Purpura, Reiter&apos;s Disease, Stiff-Man Syndrome, Autoimmune Thyroiditis, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Autoimmune Pulmonary Inflammation, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, insulin dependent diabetes mellitis, and autoimmune inflammatory eye disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0841" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0841&rsqb;</number> Similarly, allergic reactions and conditions, such as asthma (particularly allergic asthma) or other respiratory problems, may also be treated by a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention. Moreover, these molecules can be used to treat anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity to an antigenic molecule, or blood group incompatibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0842" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0842&rsqb;</number> A polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention may also be used to treat and/or prevent organ rejection or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Organ rejection occurs by host immune cell destruction of the transplanted tissue through an immune response. Similarly, an immune response is also involved in GVHD, but, in this case, the foreign transplanted immune cells destroy the host tissues. The administration of a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention that inhibits an immune response, particularly the proliferation, differentiation, or chemotaxis of T-cells, may be an effective therapy in preventing organ rejection or GVHD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0843" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0843&rsqb;</number> Similarly, a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention may also be used to modulate inflammation. For example, the polypeptide or polynucleotide may inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of cells involved in an inflammatory response. These molecules can be used to treat inflammatory conditions, both chronic and acute conditions, including inflammation associated with infection (e.g., septic shock, sepsis, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)), ischemia-reperfusion injury, endotoxin lethality, arthritis, complement-mediated hyperacute rejection, nephritis, cytokine or chemokine induced lung injury, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn&apos;s disease, or resulting from over production of cytokines (e.g., TNF or IL-1.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0844" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0844&rsqb;</number> Hyperproliferative Disorders </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0845" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0845&rsqb;</number> A polypeptide or polynucleotide can be used to treat or detect hyperproliferative disorders, including neoplasms. A polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention may inhibit the proliferation of the disorder through direct or indirect interactions. Alternatively, a polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention may proliferate other cells which can inhibit the hyperproliferative disorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0846" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0846&rsqb;</number> For example, by increasing an immune response, particularly increasing antigenic qualities of the hyperproliferative disorder or by proliferating, differentiating, or mobilizing T-cells, hyperproliferative disorders can be treated. This immune response may be increased by either enhancing an existing immune response, or by initiating a new immune response. Alternatively, decreasing an immune response may also be a method of treating hyperproliferative disorders, such as a chemotherapeutic agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0847" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0847&rsqb;</number> Examples of hyperproliferative disorders that can be treated or detected by a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention include, but are not limited to neoplasms located in the: abdomen, bone, breast, digestive system, liver, pancreas, peritoneum, endocrine glands (adrenal, parathyroid, pituitary, testicles, ovary, thymus, thyroid), eye, head and neck, nervous (central and peripheral), lymphatic system, pelvic, skin, soft tissue, spleen, thoracic, and urogenital. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0848" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0848&rsqb;</number> Similarly, other hyperproliferative disorders can also be treated or detected by a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention. Examples of such hyperproliferative disorders include, but are not limited to: hypergammaglobulinemia, lymphoproliferative disorders, paraproteinemias, purpura, sarcoidosis, Sezary Syndrome, Waldenstron&apos;s Macroglobulinemia, Gaucher&apos;s Disease, histiocytosis, and any other hyperproliferative disease, besides neoplasia, located in an organ system listed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0849" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0849&rsqb;</number> Infectious Disease </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0850" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0850&rsqb;</number> A polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention can be used to treat or detect infectious agents. For example, by increasing the immune response, particularly increasing the proliferation and differentiation of B and/or T cells, infectious diseases may be treated. The immune response may be increased by either enhancing an existing immune response, or by initiating a new immune response. Alternatively, the polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention may also directly inhibit the infectious agent, without necessarily eliciting an immune response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0851" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0851&rsqb;</number> Viruses are one example of an infectious agent that can cause disease or symptoms that can be treated or detected by a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention.

<paragraph id="P-0856" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0856&rsqb;</number> A polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention can be used to differentiate, proliferate, and attract cells, leading to the regeneration of tissues. (See, Science 276:59-87 (1997).) The regeneration of tissues could be used to repair, replace, or protect tissue damaged by congenital defects, trauma (wounds, burns, incisions, or ulcers), age, disease (e.g. osteoporosis, osteocarthritis, periodontal disease, liver failure), surgery, including cosmetic plastic surgery, fibrosis, reperfusion injury, or systemic cytokine damage. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0861" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0861&rsqb;</number> A polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention may have chemotaxis activity. A chemotaxic molecule attracts or mobilizes cells (e.g., monocytes, fibroblasts, neutrophils, T-cells, mast cells, eosinophils, epithelial and/or endothelial cells) to a particular site in the body, such as inflammation, infection, or site of hyperproliferation. The mobilized cells can then fight off and/or heal the particular trauma or abnormality. </paragraph>

These chemotactic molecules can then be used to treat inflammation, infection, hyperproliferative disorders, or any immune system disorder by increasing the number of cells targeted to a particular location in the body. For example, chemotaxic molecules can be used to treat wounds and other trauma to tissues by attracting immune cells to the injured location. Chemotactic molecules of the present invention can also attract fibroblasts, which can be used to treat wounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0863" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0863&rsqb;</number> It is also contemplated that a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the present invention may inhibit chemotactic activity.

<paragraph id="P-0866" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0866&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the molecule is closely related to the natural ligand of the polypeptide, e.g., a fragment of the ligand, or a natural substrate, a ligand, a structural or functional mimetic. (See, Coligan et al., Current Protocols in Immunology 1(2):Chapter 5 (1991).) Similarly, the molecule can be closely related to the natural receptor to which the polypeptide binds, or at least, a fragment of the receptor capable of being bound by the polypeptide (e.g., active site). In either case, the molecule can be rationally designed using known techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0867" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0867&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the screening for these molecules involves producing appropriate cells which express the polypeptide, either as a secreted protein or on the cell membrane. Preferred cells include cells from mammals, yeast, Drosophila, or <highlight><italic>E. coli. </italic></highlight>Cells expressing the polypeptide (or cell membrane containing the expressed polypeptide) are then preferably contacted with a test compound potentially containing the molecule to observe binding, stimulation, or inhibition of activity of either the polypeptide or the molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0868" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0868&rsqb;</number> The assay may simply test binding of a candidate compound to the polypeptide, wherein binding is detected by a label, or in an assay involving competition with a labeled competitor. Further, the assay may test whether the candidate compound results in a signal generated by binding to the polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0869" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0869&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the assay can be carried out using cell-free preparations, polypeptide/molecule affixed to a solid support, chemical libraries, or natural product mixtures. The assay may also simply comprise the steps of mixing a candidate compound with a solution containing a polypeptide, measuring polypeptide/molecule activity or binding, and comparing the polypeptide/molecule activity or binding to a standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0870" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0870&rsqb;</number> Preferably, an ELISA assay can measure polypeptide level or activity in a sample (e.g., biological sample) using a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody. The antibody can measure polypeptide level or activity by either binding, directly or indirectly, to the polypeptide or by competing with the polypeptide for a substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0871" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0871&rsqb;</number> All of these above assays can be used as diagnostic or prognostic markers. The molecules discovered using these assays can be used to treat disease or to bring about a particular result in a patient (e.g., blood vessel growth) by activating or inhibiting the polypeptide/molecule. Moreover, the assays can discover agents which may inhibit or enhance the production of the polypeptide from suitably manipulated cells or tissues. </paragraph>

Nos. 5,128,256 and 5,286,636), Zap Express (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,128,256 and 5,286,636), pBluescript (pBS) (Short, J. M. et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 16:7583-7600 (1988); Alting-Mees, M. A. and Short, J. M., Nucleic Acids Res. 17:9494 (1989)) and pBK (Alting-Mees, M. A. et al., Strategies 5:58-61 (1992)) are commercially available from Stratagene Cloning Systems, Inc., 11011 N. Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, Calif., 92037. pBS contains an ampicillin resistance gene and pBK contains a neomycin resistance gene. Both can be transformed into <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain XL-1 Blue, also available from Stratagene. pBS comes in 4 forms SK&plus;, SK&minus;, KS&plus; and KS. The S and K refers to the orientation of the polylinker to the T7 and T3 primer sequences which flank the polylinker region (&ldquo;S&rdquo; is for SacI and &ldquo;K&rdquo; is for KpnI which are the first sites on each respective end of the linker). &ldquo;&plus;&rdquo; or &ldquo;&minus;&rdquo; refer to the orientation of the fl origin of replication (&ldquo;ori&rdquo;), such that in one orientation, single stranded rescue initiated from the f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> ori generates sense strand DNA and in the other, antisense. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0929" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0929&rsqb;</number> Vectors pSport1, pCMVSport 2.0 and pCMVSport 3.0, were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., P. O. Box 6009, Gaithersburg, Md. 20897. All Sport vectors contain an ampicillin resistance gene and may be transformed into <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain DH10B, also available from Life Technologies. (See, for instance, Gruber, C. E., et al., Focus 15:59 (1993).) Vector lafmid BA (Bento Soares, Columbia University, NY) contains an ampicillin resistance gene and can be transformed into <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain XL-1 Blue. Vector pCR&reg;2.1, which is available from Invitrogen, 1600 Faraday Avenue, Carlsbad, Calif. 92008, contains an ampicillin resistance gene and may be transformed into <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain DH10B, available from Life Technologies. (See, for instance, Clark, J. M., Nuc. Acids Res. 16:9677-9686 (1988) and Mead, D. et al., Bio/Technology 9: (1991).) Preferably, a polynucleotide of the present invention does not comprise the phage vector sequences identified for the particular clone in Table 1, as well as the corresponding plasrnid vector sequences designated above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0930" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0930&rsqb;</number> The deposited material in the sample assigned the ATCC Deposit Number cited in Table 1 for any given cDNA clone also may contain one or more additional plasmids, each comprising a cDNA clone different from that given clone. Thus, deposits sharing the same ATCC Deposit Number contain at least a plasmid for each cDNA clone identified in Table 1. Typically, each ATCC deposit sample cited in Table 1 comprises a mixture of approximately equal amounts (by weight) of about 50 plasmid DNAs, each containing a different cDNA clone; but such a deposit sample may include plasmids for more or less than 50 cDNA clones, up to about 500 cDNA clones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0931" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0931&rsqb;</number> Two approaches can be used to isolate a particular clone from the deposited sample of plasmid DNAs cited for that clone in Table 1. First, a plasmid is directly isolated by screening the clones using a polynucleotide probe corresponding to SEQ ID NO:X. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0932" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0932&rsqb;</number> Particularly, a specific polynucleotide with 30-40 nucleotides is synthesized using an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer according to the sequence reported. The oligonucleotide is labeled, for instance, with <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-&ggr;-ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified according to routine methods. (E.g., Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring, N.Y. (1982).) The plasmid mixture is transformed into a suitable host, as indicated above (such as XL-1 Blue (Stratagene)) using techniques known to those of skill in the art, such as those provided by the vector supplier or in related publications or patents cited above. The transformants are plated on 1.5% agar plates (containing the appropriate selection agent, e.g., ampicillin) to a density of about 150 transformants (colonies) per plate. These plates are screened using Nylon membranes according to routine methods for bacterial colony screening (e.g., Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edit., (1989), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, pages 1.93 to 1.104), or other techniques known to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0933" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0933&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, two primers of 17-20 nucleotides derived from both ends of the SEQ ID NO:X (i.e., within the region of SEQ ID NO:X bounded by the 5&prime; NT and the 3&prime; NT of the clone defined in Table 1) are synthesized and used to amplify the desired cDNA using the deposited cDNA plasmid as a template. The polymerase chain reaction is carried out under routine conditions, for instance, in 25 &mgr;l of reaction mixture with 0.5 ug of the above cDNA template. A convenient reaction mixture is 1.5-5 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 0.01% (w/v) gelatin, 20 &mgr;M each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 25 pmol of each primer and 0.25 Unit of Taq polymerase. Thirty five cycles of PCR (denaturation at 94&deg; C. for 1 min; annealing at 55&deg; C. for 1 min; elongation at 72&deg; C. for 1 min) are performed with a Perkin-Elmer Cetus automated thermal cycler. The amplified product is analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the DNA band with expected molecular weight is excised and purified. The PCR product is verified to be the selected sequence by subcloning and sequencing the DNA product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0934" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0934&rsqb;</number> Several methods are available for the identification of the 5&prime; or 3&prime; non-coding portions of a gene which may not be present in the deposited clone. These methods include but are not limited to, filter probing, clone enrichment using specific probes, and protocols similar or identical to 5&prime; and 3&prime; &ldquo;RACE&rdquo; protocols which are well known in the art. For instance, a method similar to 5&prime; RACE is available for generating the missing 5&prime; end of a desired full-length transcript: (Fromont-Racine et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 21(7):1683-1684 (1993).) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0935" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0935&rsqb;</number> Briefly, a specific RNA oligonucleotide is ligated to the 5&prime; ends of a population of RNA presumably containing full-length gene RNA transcripts. A primer set containing a primer specific to the ligated RNA oligonucleotide and a primer specific to a known sequence of the gene of interest is used to PCR amplify the 5&prime; portion of the desired full-length gene. This amplified product may then be sequenced and used to generate the full length gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0936" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0936&rsqb;</number> This above method starts with total RNA isolated from the desired source, although poly-A&plus; RNA can be used. The RNA preparation can then be treated with phosphatase if necessary to eliminate 5&prime; phosphate groups on degraded or damaged RNA which may interfere with the later RNA ligase step. The phosphatase should then be inactivated and the RNA treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase in order to remove the cap structure present at the 5&prime; ends of messenger RNAs. This reaction leaves a 5&prime; phosphate group at the 5&prime; end of the cap cleaved RNA which can then be ligated to an RNA oligonucleotide using T4 RNA ligase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0937" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0937&rsqb;</number> This modified RNA preparation is used as a template for first strand cDNA synthesis using a gene specific oligonucleotide. The first strand synthesis reaction is used as a template for PCR amplification of the desired 5&prime; end using a primer specific to the ligated RNA oligonucleotide and a primer specific to the known sequence of the gene of interest. The resultant product is then sequenced and analyzed to confirm that the 5&prime; end sequence belongs to the desired gene. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0941" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0941&rsqb;</number> Tissue distribution of mRNA expression of polynucleotides of the present invention is determined using protocols for Northern blot analysis, described by, among others, Sambrook et al. For example, a cDNA probe produced by the method described in Example 1 is labeled with P<highlight><superscript>32 </superscript></highlight>using the rediprime&trade; DNA labeling system (Amersham Life Science), according to manufacturer&apos;s instructions. After labeling, the probe is purified using CHROMA SPIN-100&trade; column (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.), according to manufacturer&apos;s protocol number PT1200-1. The purified labeled probe is then used to examine various human tissues for mRNA expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0942" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0942&rsqb;</number> Multiple Tissue Northern (MTN) blots containing various human tissues (H) or human immune system tissues (IM) (Clontech) are examined with the labeled probe using ExpressHyb&trade; hybridization solution (Clontech) according to manufacturer&apos;s protocol number PT1190-1. Following hybridization and washing, the blots are mounted and exposed to film at &minus;70&deg; C. overnight, and the films developed according to standard procedures. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0944" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0944&rsqb;</number> An oligonucleotide primer set is designed according to the sequence at the 5&prime; end of SEQ ID NO:X. This primer preferably spans about 100 nucleotides. This primer set is then used in a polymerase chain reaction under the following set of conditions: 30 seconds, 95&deg; C.; 1 minute, 56&deg; C.; 1 minute, 70&deg; C. This cycle is repeated 32 times followed by one 5 minute cycle at 70&deg; C. Human, mouse, and hamster DNA is used as template in addition to a somatic cell hybrid panel containing individual chromosomes or chromosome fragments (Bios, Inc). The reactions is analyzed on either 8% polyacrylamide gels or 3.5% agarose gels. Chromosome mapping is determined by the presence of an approximately 100 bp PCR fragment in the particular somatic cell hybrid. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0945" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0945&rsqb;</number> Bacterial Expression of a Polypeptide </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0946" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0946&rsqb;</number> A polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention is amplified using PCR oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends of the DNA sequence, as outlined in Example 1, to synthesize insertion fragments. The primers used to amplify the cDNA insert should preferably contain restriction sites, such as BamHI and XbaI, at the 5&prime; end of the primers in order to clone the amplified product into the expression vector. For example, BamHI and XbaI correspond to the restriction enzyme sites on the bacterial expression vector pQE-9. (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, Calif.). This plasmid vector encodes antibiotic resistance (Amp<highlight><superscript>r</superscript></highlight>), a bacterial origin of replication (ori), an IPTG-regulatable promoter/operator (P/O), a ribosome binding site (RBS), a 6-histidine tag (6-His), and restriction enzyme cloning sites. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0947" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0947&rsqb;</number> The pQE-9 vector is digested with BamHI and XbaI and the amplified fragment is ligated into the pQE-9 vector maintaining the reading frame initiated at the bacterial RBS. The ligation mixture is then used to transform the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain M15/rep4 (Qiagen, Inc.) which contains multiple copies of the plasmid pREP4, which expresses the lacI repressor and also confers kanamycin resistance (Kan<highlight><superscript>r</superscript></highlight>). Transformants are identified by their ability to grow on LB plates and ampicillin/kanamycin resistant colonies are selected. Plasmid DNA is isolated and confirmed by restriction analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0948" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0948&rsqb;</number> Clones containing the desired constructs are grown overnight (O/N) in liquid culture in LB media supplemented with both Amp (100 ug/ml) and Kan (25 ug/ml). The O/N culture is used to inoculate a large culture at a ratio of 1:100 to 1:250. The cells are grown to an optical density 600 (O.D.<highlight><superscript>600</superscript></highlight>) of between 0.4 and 0.6. IPTG (Isopropyl-B-D-thiogalacto pyranoside) is then added to a final concentration of 1 mM. IPTG induces by inactivating the lacI repressor, clearing the P/O leading to increased gene expression. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0949" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0949&rsqb;</number> Cells are grown for an extra 3 to 4 hours. Cells are then harvested by centrifugation (20 mins at 6000&times;g). The cell pellet is solubilized in the chaotropic agent 6 Molar Guanidine HCl by stirring for 3-4 hours at 4&deg; C. The cell debris is removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the polypeptide is loaded onto a nickel-nitrilo-tri-acetic acid (&ldquo;Ni-NTA&rdquo;) affinity resin column (available from QIAGEN, Inc., supra). Proteins with a 6&times;His tag bind to the Ni-NTA resin with high affinity and can be purified in a simple one-step procedure (for details see: The QIAexpressionist (1995) QIAGEN, Inc., supra). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0950" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0950&rsqb;</number> Briefly, the supernatant is loaded onto the column in 6 M guanidine-HCl, pH 8, the column is first washed with 10 volumes of 6 M guanidine-HCl, pH 8, then washed with 10 volumes of 6 M guanidine-HCl pH 6, and finally the polypeptide is eluted with 6 M guanidine-HCl, pH 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0951" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0951&rsqb;</number> The purified protein is then renatured by dialyzing it against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 50 mM Na-acetate, pH 6 buffer plus 200 mM NaCl. Alternatively, the protein can be successfully refolded while immobilized on the Ni-NTA column. The recommended conditions are as follows: renature using a linear 6M-1M urea gradient in 500 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, containing protease inhibitors. The renaturation should be performed over a period of 1.5 hours or more. After renaturation the proteins are eluted by the addition of 250 mM immidazole. Immidazole is removed by a final dialyzing step against PBS or 50 mM sodium acetate pH 6 buffer plus 200 mM NaCl. The purified protein is stored at 4&deg; C. or frozen at &minus;80&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0952" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0952&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above expression vector, the present invention further includes an expression vector comprising phage operator and promoter elements operatively linked to a polynucleotide of the present invention, called pHE4a. (ATCC Accession Number 209645, deposited on Feb. 25, 1998.) This vector contains: 1) a neomycinphosphotransferase gene as a selection marker, 2) an <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>origin of replication, 3) a T5 phage promoter sequence, 4) two lac operator sequences, 5) a Shine-Delgarno sequence, and 6) the lactose operon repressor gene (lacIq). The origin of replication (oriC) is derived from pUC19 (LTI, Gaithersburg, Md.). The promoter sequence and operator sequences are made synthetically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0953" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0953&rsqb;</number> DNA can be inserted into the pHEa by restricting the vector with NdeI and XbaI, BamHI, XhoI, or Asp718, running the restricted product on a gel, and isolating the larger fragment (the stuffer fragment should be about 310 base pairs). The DNA insert is generated according to the PCR protocol described in Example 1, using PCR primers having restriction sites for NdeI (5&prime; primer) and XbaI, BamHI, XhoI, or Asp718 (3&prime; primer). The PCR insert is gel purified and restricted with compatible enzymes. The insert and vector are ligated according to standard protocols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0954" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0954&rsqb;</number> The engineered vector could easily be substituted in the above protocol to express protein in a bacterial system. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0956" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0956&rsqb;</number> The following alternative method can be used to purify a polypeptide expressed in <highlight><italic>E coli </italic></highlight>when it is present in the form of inclusion bodies. Unless otherwise specified, all of the following steps are conducted at 4-10&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0957" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0957&rsqb;</number> Upon completion of the production phase of the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>fermentation, the cell culture is cooled to 4-10&deg; C. and the cells harvested by continuous centrifugation at 15,000 rpm (Heraeus Sepatech). On the basis of the expected yield of protein per unit weight of cell paste and the amount of purified protein required, an appropriate amount of cell paste, by weight, is suspended in a buffer solution containing 100 mM Tris, 50 mM EDTA, pH 7.4. The cells are dispersed to a homogeneous suspension using a high shear mixer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0958" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0958&rsqb;</number> The cells are then lysed by passing the solution through a microfluidizer (Microfuidics, Corp. or APV Gaulin, Inc.) twice at 4000-6000 psi. The homogenate is then mixed with NaCl solution to a final concentration of 0.5 M NaCl, followed by centrifugation at 7000&times;g for 15 min. The resultant pellet is washed again using 0.5M NaCl, 100 mM Tris, 50 mM EDTA, pH 7.4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0959" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0959&rsqb;</number> The resulting washed inclusion bodies are solubilized with 1.5 M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) for 2-4 hours. After 7000&times;g centrifugation for 15 min., the pellet is discarded and the polypeptide containing supernatant is incubated at 4&deg; C. overnight to allow further GuHCl extraction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0960" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0960&rsqb;</number> Following high speed centrifugation (30,000&times; g) to remove insoluble particles, the GuHCl solubilized protein is refolded by quickly mixing the GuHCI extract with 20 volumes of buffer containing 50 mM sodium, pH 4.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA by vigorous stirring. The refolded diluted protein solution is kept at 4&deg; C. without mixing for 12 hours prior to further purification steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0961" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0961&rsqb;</number> To clarify the refolded polypeptide solution, a previously prepared tangential filtration unit equipped with 0.16 &mgr;m membrane filter with appropriate surface area (e.g., Filtron), equilibrated with 40 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0 is employed. The filtered sample is loaded onto a cation exchange resin (e.g., Poros HS-50, Perseptive Biosystems). The column is washed with 40 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0 and eluted with 250 mM, 500 mM, 1000 mM, and 1500 mM NaCl in the same buffer, in a stepwise manner. The absorbance at 280 nm of the effluent is continuously monitored. Fractions are collected and further analyzed by SDS-PAGE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0962" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0962&rsqb;</number> Fractions containing the polypeptide are then pooled and mixed with 4 volumes of water. The diluted sample is then loaded onto a previously prepared set of tandem columns of strong anion (Poros HQ-50, Perseptive Biosystems) and weak anion (Poros CM-20, Perseptive Biosystems) exchange resins. The columns are equilibrated with 40 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0. Both columns are washed with 40 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0, 200 mM NaCl. The CM-20 column is then eluted using a 10 column volume linear gradient ranging from 0.2 M NaCl, 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.0 to 1.0 M NaCl, 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 6.5. Fractions are collected under constant A<highlight><subscript>280 </subscript></highlight>monitoring of the effluent. Fractions containing the polypeptide (determined, for instance, by 16% SDS-PAGE) are then pooled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0963" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0963&rsqb;</number> The resultant polypeptide should exhibit greater than 95% purity after the above refolding and purification steps. No major contaminant bands should be observed from Commassie blue stained 16% SDS-PAGE gel when 5 &mgr;g of purified protein is loaded. The purified protein can also be tested for endotoxin/LPS contamination, and typically the LPS content is less than 0.1 ng/ml according to LAL assays. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0964" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0964&rsqb;</number> Cloning and Expression of a Polypeptide in a Baculovirus Expression System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0965" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0965&rsqb;</number> In this example, the plasmid shuttle vector pA2 is used to insert a polynucleotide into a baculovirus to express a polypeptide. This expression vector contains the strong polyhedrin promoter of the <highlight><italic>Autographa californica </italic></highlight>nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) followed by convenient restriction sites such as BamHI, Xba I and Asp718. The polyadenylation site of the simian virus 40 (&ldquo;SV40&rdquo;) is used for efficient polyadenylation. For easy selection of recombinant virus, the plasmid contains the beta-galactosidase gene from <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>under control of a weak Drosophila promoter in the same orientation, followed by the polyadenylation signal of the polyhedrin gene. The inserted genes are flanked on both sides by viral sequences for cell-mediated homologous recombination with wild-type viral DNA to generate a viable virus that express the cloned polynucleotide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0966" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0966&rsqb;</number> Many other baculovirus vectors can be used in place of the vector above, such as pAc373, pVL941, and pAcIM1, as one skilled in the art would readily appreciate, as long as the construct provides appropriately located signals for transcription, translation, secretion and the like, including a signal peptide and an in-frame AUG as required. Such vectors are described, for instance, in Luckow et al., Virology 170:31-39 (1989). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0967" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0967&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the cDNA sequence contained in the deposited clone, including the AUG initiation codon and the naturally associated leader sequence identified in Table 1, is amplified using the PCR protocol described in Example 1. If the naturally occurring signal sequence is used to produce the secreted protein, the pA2 vector does not need a second signal peptide. Alternatively, the vector can be modified (pA2 GP) to include a baculovirus leader sequence, using the standard methods described in Summers et al., &ldquo;A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures,&rdquo; Texas Agricultural Experimental Station Bulletin No. 1555 (1987). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0968" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0968&rsqb;</number> The amplified fragment is isolated from a 1% agarose gel using a commercially available kit (&ldquo;Geneclean,&rdquo; BIO 101 Inc., La Jolla, Calif.). The fragment then is digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and again purified on a 1% agarose gel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0969" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0969&rsqb;</number> The plasmid is digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes and optionally, can be dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphatase, using routine procedures known in the art. The DNA is then isolated from a 1% agarose gel using a commercially available kit (&ldquo;Geneclean&rdquo; BIO 101 Inc., La Jolla, Calif.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0970" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0970&rsqb;</number> The fragment and the dephosphorylated plasmid are ligated together with T4 DNA ligase. <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>HB101 or other suitable <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>hosts such as XL-1 Blue (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, Calif.) cells are transformed with the ligation mixture and spread on culture plates. Bacteria containing the plasmid are identified by digesting DNA from individual colonies and analyzing the digestion product by gel electrophoresis. The sequence of the cloned fragment is confirmed by DNA sequencing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0971" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0971&rsqb;</number> Five &mgr;g of a plasmid containing the polynucleotide is co-transfected with 1.0 &mgr;g of a commercially available linearized baculovirus DNA (&ldquo;BaculoGold&trade; baculovirus DNA&rdquo;, Pharningen, San Diego, Calif.), using the lipofection method described by Felgner et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:7413-7417 (1987). One &mgr;g of BaculoGold&trade; virus DNA and 5 &mgr;g of the plasmid are mixed in a sterile well of a microtiter plate containing 50 &mgr;l of serum-free Grace&apos;s medium (Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.). Afterwards, 10 &mgr;l Lipofectin plus 90 &mgr;l Grace&apos;s medium are added, mixed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Then the transfection mixture is added drop-wise to Sf9 insect cells (ATCC CRL 1711) seeded in a 35 mm tissue culture plate with 1 ml Grace&apos;s medium without serum. The plate is then incubated for 5 hours at 27&deg; C. The transfection solution is then removed from the plate and 1 ml of Grace&apos;s insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum is added. Cultivation is then continued at 27&deg; C. for four days. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0972" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0972&rsqb;</number> After four days the supernatant is collected and a plaque assay is performed, as described by Summers and Smith, supra. An agarose gel with &ldquo;Blue Gal&rdquo; (Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg) is used to allow easy identification and isolation of gal-expressing clones, which produce blue-stained plaques. (A detailed description of a &ldquo;plaque assay&rdquo; of this type can also be found in the user&apos;s guide for insect cell culture and baculovirology distributed by Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, page 9-10.) After appropriate incubation, blue stained plaques are picked with the tip of a micropipettor (e.g., Eppendorf). The agar containing the recombinant viruses is then resuspended in a microcentrifuge tube containing 200 &mgr;l of Grace&apos;s medium and the suspension containing the recombinant baculovirus is used to infect Sf9 cells seeded in 35 mm dishes. Four days later the supernatants of these culture dishes are harvested and then they are stored at 4&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0973" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0973&rsqb;</number> To verify the expression of the polypeptide, Sf9 cells are grown in Grace&apos;s medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. The cells are infected with the recombinant baculovirus containing the polynucleotide at a multiplicity of infection (&ldquo;MOI&rdquo;) of about 2. If radiolabeled proteins are desired, 6 hours later the medium is removed and is replaced with SF900 II medium minus methionine and cysteine (available from Life Technologies Inc., Rockville, Md.). After 42 hours, 5 &mgr;Ci of <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S-methionine and 5 &mgr;Ci <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S-cysteine (available from Amersham) are added. The cells are further incubated for 16 hours and then are harvested by centrifugation. The proteins in the supernatant as well as the intracellular proteins are analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography (if radiolabeled). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0974" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0974&rsqb;</number> Microsequencing of the amino acid sequence of the amino terminus of purified protein may be used to determine the amino terminal sequence of the produced protein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0975" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0975&rsqb;</number> Expression of a Polypeptide in Mammalian Cells </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0976" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0976&rsqb;</number> The polypeptide of the present invention can be expressed in a mammalian cell. A typical mammalian expression vector contains a promoter element, which mediates the initiation of transcription of mRNA, a protein coding sequence, and signals required for the termination of transcription and polyadenylation of the transcript. Additional elements include enhancers, Kozak sequences and intervening sequences flanked by donor and acceptor sites for RNA splicing. Highly efficient transcription is achieved with the early and late promoters from SV40, the long terminal repeats (LTRs) from Retroviruses, e.g., RSV, HTLVI, HIVI and the early promoter of the cytomegalovirus (CMV). However, cellular elements can also be used (e.g., the human actin promoter). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0977" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0977&rsqb;</number> Suitable expression vectors for use in practicing the present invention include, for example, vectors such as pSVL and pMSG (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), pRSVcat (ATCC 37152), pSV2dhfr (ATCC 37146), pBC12MI (ATCC 67109), pCMVSport 2.0, and pC-MVSport 3.0. Mammalian host cells that could be used include, human Hela, 293, H9 and Jurkat cells, mouse NIH3T3 and C127 cells, Cos 1, Cos 7 and CV1, quail QC1-3 cells, mouse L cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0978" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0978&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the polypeptide can be expressed in stable cell lines containing the polynucleotide integrated into a chromosome. The co-transfection with a selectable marker such as dhfr, gpt, neomycin, hygromycin allows the identification and isolation of the transfected cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0979" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0979&rsqb;</number> The transfected gene can also be amplified to express large amounts of the encoded protein. The DHFR (dihydrofolate reductase) marker is useful in developing cell lines that carry several hundred or even several thousand copies of the gene of interest. (See, e.g., Alt, F. W., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 253:1357-1370 (1978); Hamnlin, J. L. and Ma, C., Biochem. et Biophys. Acta, 1097:107-143 (1990); Page, M. J. and Sydenham, M. A., Biotechnology 9:64-68 (1991).) Another useful selection marker is the enzyme glutamine synthase (GS) (Murphy et al., Biochem J. 227:277-279 (1991); Bebbington et al., Bio/Technology 10:169-175 (1992). Using these markers, the mammalian cells are grown in selective medium and the cells with the highest resistance are selected. These cell lines contain the amplified gene(s) integrated into a chromosome. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and NSO cells are often used for the production of proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0980" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0980&rsqb;</number> Derivatives of the plasmid pSV2-dhfr (ATCC Accession No. 37146), the expression vectors pC4 (ATCC Accession No. 209646) and pC6 (ATCC Accession No.209647) contain the strong promoter (LTR) of the Rous Sarcoma Virus (Cullen et al., Molecular and Cellular Biology, 438-447 (March, 1985)) plus a fragment of the CMV-enhancer (Boshart et al., Cell 41:521-530 (1985).) Multiple cloning sites, e.g., with the restriction enzyme cleavage sites BamHI, XbaI and Asp718, facilitate the cloning of the gene of interest. The vectors also contain the 3&prime; intron, the polyadenylation and termination signal of the rat preproinsulin gene, and the mouse DHFR gene under control of the SV40 early promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0981" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0981&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the plasmid pC6, for example, is digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and then dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphates by procedures known in the art. The vector is then isolated from a 1% agarose gel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0982" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0982&rsqb;</number> A polynucleotide of the present invention is amplified according to the protocol outlined in Example 1. If the naturally occurring signal sequence is used to produce the secreted protein, the vector does not need a second signal peptide. Alternatively, if the naturally occurring signal sequence is not used, the vector can be modified to include a heterologous signal sequence. (See, e.g., WO 96/34891.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0983" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0983&rsqb;</number> The amplified fragment is isolated from a 1% agarose gel using a commercially available kit (&ldquo;Geneclean,&rdquo; BIO 101 Inc., La Jolla, Calif.). The fragment then is digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and again purified on a 1% agarose gel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0984" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0984&rsqb;</number> The amplified fragment is then digested with the same restriction enzyme and purified on a 1% agarose gel. The isolated fragment and the dephosphorylated vector are then ligated with T4 DNA ligase. <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>HB101 or XL-1 Blue cells are then transformed and bacteria are identified that contain the fragment inserted into plasmid pC6 using, for instance, restriction enzyme analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0985" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0985&rsqb;</number> Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking an active DHFR gene is used for transfection. Five &mgr;g of the expression plasmid pC6 is cotransfected with 0.5 &mgr;g of the plasmid pSVneo using lipofectin (Felgner et al., supra). The plasmid pSV2-neo contains a dominant selectable marker, the neo gene from Tn5 encoding an enzyme that confers resistance to a group of antibiotics including G418. The cells are seeded in alpha minus MEM supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418. After 2 days, the cells are trypsinized and seeded in hybridoma cloning plates (Greiner, Germany) in alpha minus MEM supplemented with 10, 25, or 50 ng/ml of metothrexate plus 1 mg/ml G418. After about 10-14 days single clones are trypsinized and then seeded in 6-well petri dishes or 10 ml flasks using different concentrations of methotrexate (50 nM, 100 nM, 200 nM, 400 nM, 800 nM). Clones growing at the highest concentrations of methotrexate are then transferred to new 6-well plates containing even higher concentrations of methotrexate (1 &mgr;M, 2 &mgr;M, 5 &mgr;M, 10 mM, 20 mM). The same procedure is repeated until clones are obtained which grow at a concentration of 100-200 &mgr;M. Expression of the desired gene product is analyzed, for instance, by SDS-PAGE and Western blot or by reversed phase HPLC analysis. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0986" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0986&rsqb;</number> Protein Fusions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0987" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0987&rsqb;</number> The polypeptides of the present invention are preferably fused to other proteins. These fusion proteins can be used for a variety of applications. For example, fusion of the present polypeptides to His-tag, HA-tag, protein A, IgG domains, and maltose binding protein facilitates purification. (See Example 5; see also EP A 394,827; Traunecker, et al., Nature 331:84-86 (1988).) Similarly, fusion to IgG-1, IgG-3, and albumin increases the halflife time in vivo. Nuclear localization signals fused to the polypeptides of the present invention can target the protein to a specific subcellular localization, while covalent heterodimer or homodimers can increase or decrease the activity of a fusion protein. Fusion proteins can also create chimeric molecules having more than one function. Finally, fusion proteins can increase solubility and/or stability of the fused protein compared to the non-fused protein. All of the types of fusion proteins described above can be made by modifying the following protocol, which outlines the fusion of a polypeptide to an IgG molecule, or the protocol described in Example 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0988" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0988&rsqb;</number> Briefly, the human Fc portion of the IgG molecule can be PCR amplified, using primers that span the 5&prime; and 3&prime; ends of the sequence described below. These primers also should have convenient restriction enzyme sites that will facilitate cloning into an expression vector, preferably a manamalian expression vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0989" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0989&rsqb;</number> For example, if pC4 (Accession No. 209646) is used, the human Fc portion can be ligated into the BamHlI cloning site. Note that the 3&prime; BamHI site should be destroyed. Next, the vector containing the human Fc portion is re-restricted with BamHI, linearizing the vector, and a polynucleotide of the present invention, isolated by the PCR protocol described in Example 1, is ligated into this BamHI site. Note that the polynucleotide is cloned without a stop codon, otherwise a fusion protein will not be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0990" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0990&rsqb;</number> If the naturally occurring signal sequence is used to produce the secreted protein, pC4 does not need a second signal peptide. Alternatively, if the naturally occurring signal sequence is not used, the vector can be modified to include a heterologous signal sequence. (See, e.g., WO 96/34891.)

<paragraph id="P-0991" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0991&rsqb;</number> Production of an Antibody from a Polypeptide </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0992" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0992&rsqb;</number> The antibodies of the present invention can be prepared by a variety of methods. (See, Current Protocols, Chapter 2.) For example, cells expressing a polypeptide of the present invention is administered to an animal to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies. In a preferred method, a preparation of the secreted protein is prepared and purified to render it substantially free of natural contaminants. Such a preparation is then introduced into an animal in order to produce polyclonal antisera of greater specific activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0993" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0993&rsqb;</number> In the most preferred method, the antibodies of the present invention are monoclonal antibodies (or protein binding fragments thereof). Such monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using hybridoma technology. (K&ouml;hler et al., Nature 256:495 (1975); K&ouml;hler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 6:511 (1976); K&ouml;hler et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 6:292 (1976); Hammerling et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-Cell Hybridomas, Elsevier, N.Y., pp. 563-681 (1981).) In general, such procedures involve immunizing an animal (preferably a mouse) with polypeptide or, more preferably, with a secreted polypeptide-expressing cell. Such cells may be cultured in any suitable tissue culture medium; however, it is preferable to culture cells in Earle&apos;s modified Eagle&apos;s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (inactivated at about 56&deg; C.), and supplemented with about 10 g/l of nonessential amino acids, about 1,000 U/ml of penicillin, and about 100 &mgr;/ml of streptomycin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0994" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0994&rsqb;</number> The splenocytes of such mice are extracted and fused with a suitable myeloma cell line. Any suitable myeloma cell line may be employed in accordance with the present invention; however, it is preferable to employ the parent myeloma cell line (SP2O), available from the ATCC. After fusion, the resulting hybridoma cells are selectively maintained in HAT medium, and then cloned by limiting dilution as described by Wands et al. (Gastroenterology 80:225-232 (1981).) The hybridoma cells obtained through such a selection are then assayed to identify clones which secrete antibodies capable of binding the polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0995" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0995&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, additional antibodies capable of binding to the polypeptide can be produced in a two-step procedure using anti-idiotypic antibodies. Such a method makes use of the fact that antibodies are themselves antigens, and therefore, it is possible to obtain an antibody which binds to a second antibody. In accordance with this method, protein specific antibodies are used to immunize an animal, preferably a mouse. The splenocytes of such an animal are then used to produce hybridoma cells, and the hybridoma cells are screened to identify clones which produce an antibody whose ability to bind to the protein-specific antibody can be blocked by the polypeptide. Such antibodies comprise anti-idiotypic antibodies to the protein-specific antibody and can be used to immunize an animal to induce formation of further protein-specific antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0996" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0996&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that Fab and F(ab&prime;)2 and other fragments of the antibodies of the present invention may be used according to the methods disclosed herein. Such fragments are typically produced by proteolytic cleavage, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab&prime;)2 fragments). Alternatively, secreted protein-binding fragments can be produced through the application of recombinant DNA technology or through synthetic chemistry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0997" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0997&rsqb;</number> For in vivo use of antibodies in humans, it may be preferable to use &ldquo;humanized&rdquo; chimeric monoclonal antibodies. Such antibodies can be produced using genetic constructs derived from hybridoma cells producing the monoclonal antibodies described above. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. (See, for review, Morrison, Science 229:1202 (1985); Oi et al., BioTechniques 4:214 (1986); Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Taniguchi et al., EP 171496; Morrison et al., EP 173494; Neuberger et al., WO 8601533; Robinson et al., WO 8702671; Boulianne et al., Nature 312:643 (1984); Neuberger et al., Nature 314:268 (1985).) </paragraph>

With a small volume multi-channel pipetter, aliquot approximately 2 ug of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide insert, produced by the methods described in Examples 8 or 9, into an appropriately labeled 96-well round bottom plate.

<paragraph id="P-1009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1009&rsqb;</number> One signal transduction pathway involved in the differentiation and proliferation of cells is called the Jaks-STATs pathway. Activated proteins in the Jaks-STATs pathway bind to gamma activation site &ldquo;GAS&rdquo; elements or interferon-sensitive responsive element (&ldquo;ISRE&rdquo;), located in the promoter of many genes. The binding of a protein to these elements alter the expression of the associated gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1010&rsqb;</number> GAS and ISRE elements are recognized by a class of transcription factors called Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription, or &ldquo;STATs.&rdquo; There are six members of the STATs family. Stat1 and Stat3 are present in many cell types, as is Stat2 (as response to IFN-alpha is widespread). Stat4 is more restricted and is not in many cell types though it has been found in T helper class I, cells after treatment with IL-12. Stat5 was originally called mammary growth factor, but has been found at higher concentrations in other cells including myeloid cells. It can be activated in tissue culture cells by many cytokines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1011&rsqb;</number> The STATs are activated to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon tyrosine phosphorylation by a set of kinases known as the Janus Kinase (&ldquo;Jaks&rdquo;) family. Jaks represent a distinct family of soluble tyrosine kinases and include Tyk2, Jak1, Jak2, and Jak3. These kinases display significant sequence similarity and are generally catalytically inactive in resting cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1012&rsqb;</number> The Jaks are activated by a wide range of receptors summarized in the Table below. (Adapted from review by Schidler and Damell, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 64:621-51 (1995).) A cytokine receptor family, capable of activating Jaks, is divided into two groups: (a) Class 1 includes receptors for IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-9, IL-11, IL-12, IL-15, Epo, PRL, GH, G-CSF, GM-CSF, LIF, CNTF, and thrombopoietin; and (b) Class 2 includes IFN-a, IFN-g, and IL-10. The Class 1 receptors share a conserved cysteine motif (a set of four conserved cysteines and one tryptophan) and a WSXWS motif (a membrane proximal region encoding Trp-Ser-Xxx-Trp-Ser (SEQ ID NO:2)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1013&rsqb;</number> Thus, on binding of a ligand to a receptor, Jaks are activated, which in turn activate STATs, which then translocate and bind to GAS elements. This entire process is encompassed in the Jaks-STATs signal transduction pathway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1014&rsqb;</number> Therefore, activation of the Jaks-STATs pathway, reflected by the binding of the GAS or the ISRE element, can be used to indicate proteins involved in the proliferation and differentiation of cells. For example, growth factors and cytokines are known to activate the Jaks-STATs pathway. (See Table below.) Thus, by using GAS elements linked to reporter molecules, activators of the Jaks-STATs pathway can be identified.

<paragraph id="P-1018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1018&rsqb;</number> With this GAS promoter element linked to the SV40 promoter, a GAS:SEAP2 reporter construct is next engineered. Here, the reporter molecule is a secreted alkaline phosphatase, or &ldquo;SEAP.&rdquo; Clearly, however, any reporter molecule can be instead of SEAP, in this or in any of the other Examples. Well known reporter molecules that can be used instead of SEAP include chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), luciferase, alkaline phosphatase, B-galactosidase, green fluorescent protein (GFP), or any protein detectable by an antibody. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1019&rsqb;</number> The above sequence confirmed synthetic GAS-SV40 promoter element is subcloned into the pSEAP-Promoter vector obtained from Clontech using HindIII and XhoI, effectively replacing the SV40 promoter with the amplified GAS:SV40 promoter element, to create the GAS-SEAP vector. However, this vector does not contain a neomycin resistance gene, and therefore, is not preferred for mammalian expression systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1020&rsqb;</number> Thus, in order to generate mammalian stable cell lines expressing the GAS-SEAP reporter, the GAS-SEAP cassette is removed from the GAS-SEAP vector using SalI and NotI, and inserted into a backbone vector containing the neomycin resistance gene, such as pGFP-1 (Clontech), using these restriction sites in the multiple cloning site, to create the GAS-SEAP/Neo vector. Once this vector is transfected into mammalian cells, this vector can then be used as a reporter molecule for GAS binding as described in Examples 13-14. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1021&rsqb;</number> Other constructs can be made using the above description and replacing GAS with a different promoter sequence. For example, construction of reporter molecules containing NFK-B and EGR promoter sequences are described in Examples 15 and 16. However, many other promoters can be substituted using the protocols described in these Examples. For instance, SRE, IL-2, NFAT, or Osteocalcin promoters can be substituted, alone or in combination (e.g., GAS/NF-KB/EGR, GAS/NF-KB, Il-2/NFAT, or NF-KB/GAS).

<paragraph id="P-1023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1023&rsqb;</number> The following protocol is used to assess T-cell activity by identifying factors, such as growth factors and cytokines, that may proliferate or differentiate T-cells. T-cell activity is assessed using the GAS/SEAP/Neo construct produced in Example 12. Thus, factors that increase SEAP activity indicate the ability to activate the Jaks-STATS signal transduction pathway. The T-cell used in this assay is Jurkat T-cells (ATCC Accession No. TIB-152), although Molt-3 cells (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1552) and Molt-4 cells (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1582) cells can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1024&rsqb;</number> Jurkat T-cells are lymphoblastic CD4&plus; Th1 helper cells. In order to generate stable cell lines, approximately 2 million Jurkat cells are transfected with the GAS-SEAP/neo vector using DMRIE-C (Life Technologies)(transfection procedure described below). The transfected cells are seeded to a density of approximately 20,000 cells per well and transfectants resistant to 1 mg/ml genticin selected. Resistant colonies are expanded and then tested for their response to increasing concentrations of interferon gamma. The dose response of a selected clone is demonstrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1025&rsqb;</number> Specifically, the following protocol will yield sufficient cells for 75 wells containing 200 ul of cells. Thus, it is either scaled up, or performed in multiple to generate sufficient cells for multiple 96 well plates. Jurkat cells are maintained in RPMI &plus;10% serum with 1% Pen-Strep. Combine 2.5 mls of OPTI-MEM (Life Technologies) with 10 ug of plasmid DNA in a T25 flask. Add 2.5 ml OPTI-MEM containing 50 ul of DMRIE-C and incubate at room temperature for 15-45 mins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1026&rsqb;</number> During the incubation period, count cell concentration, spin down the required number of cells (10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>per transfection), and resuspend in OPTI-MEM to a final concentration of 10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml. Then add 1 ml of 1&times; 10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>cells in OPTI-MEM to T25 flask and incubate at 37&deg; C. for 6 hrs. After the incubation, add 10 ml of RPMI&plus;15% serum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1027&rsqb;</number> The Jurkat:GAS-SEAP stable reporter lines are maintained in RPMI <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> 10% serum, 1 mg/ml Genticin, and 1% Pen-Strep. These cells are treated with supernatants containing a polypeptide as produced by the protocol described in Example 11. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1028&rsqb;</number> On the day of treatment with the supernatant, the cells should be washed and resuspended in fresh RPMI&plus;10% serum to a density of 500,000 cells per ml. The exact number of cells required will depend on the number of supernatants being screened. For one 96 well plate, approximately 10 million cells (for 10 plates, 100 million cells) are required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1029&rsqb;</number> Transfer the cells to a triangular reservoir boat, in order to dispense the cells into a 96 well dish, using a 12 channel pipette. Using a 12 channel pipette, transfer 200 ul of cells into each well (therefore adding 100,000 cells per well). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1030&rsqb;</number> After all the plates have been seeded, 50 ul of the supernatants are transferred directly from the 96 well plate containing the supernatants into each well using a 12 channel pipette. In addition, a dose of exogenous interferon gamma (0.1, 1.0, 10 ng) is added to wells H9, H10, and H11 to serve as additional positive controls for the assay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1031&rsqb;</number> The 96 well dishes containing Jurkat cells treated with supernatants are placed in an incubator for 48 hrs (note: this time is variable between 48-72 hrs). 35 ul samples from each well are then transferred to an opaque 96 well plate using a 12 channel pipette. The opaque plates should be covered (using sellophene covers) and stored at &minus;20&deg; C. until SEAP assays are performed according to Example 17. The plates containing the remaining treated cells are placed at 4&deg; C. and serve as a source of material for repeating the assay on a specific well if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1032&rsqb;</number> As a positive control, 100 Unit/ml interferon gamma can be used which is known to activate Jurkat T cells. Over 30 fold induction is typically observed in the positive control wells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1033&rsqb;</number> The above protocol may be used in the generation of both transient, as well as, stable transfected cells, which would be apparent to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>

Myeloid cell activity is assessed using the GAS/SEAP/Neo construct produced in Example 12. Thus, factors that increase SEAP activity indicate the ability to activate the Jaks-STATS signal transduction pathway. The myeloid cell used in this assay is U937, a pre-monocyte cell line, although TF-1, HL60, or KG1 can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1036&rsqb;</number> To transiently transfect U937 cells with the GAS/SEAP/Neo construct produced in Example 12, a DEAE-Dextran method (Kharbanda et. al., 1994, Cell Growth &amp; Differentiation, 5:259-265) is used. First, harvest 2&times; 10e<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>U937 cells and wash with PBS. The U937 cells are usually grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBES) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1037&rsqb;</number> Next, suspend the cells in 1 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml DEAE-Dextran, 8 ug GAS-SEAP2 plasmid DNA, 140 mnM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 375 uM Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>HPO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>.7H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, 1 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and 675 uM CaCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-1039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1039&rsqb;</number> The GAS-SEAP/U937 stable cells are obtained by growing the cells in 400 ug/ml G418. The G418-free medium is used for routine growth but every one to two months, the cells should be re-grown in 400 ug/ml G418 for couple of passages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1040&rsqb;</number> These cells are tested by harvesting 1&times; 10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>cells (this is enough for ten 96-well plates assay) and wash with PBS.

<paragraph id="P-1043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1043&rsqb;</number> When cells undergo differentiation and proliferation, a group of genes are activated through many different signal transduction pathways. One of these genes, EGR1 (early growth response gene 1), is induced in various tissues and cell types upon activation. The promoter of EGR1 is responsible for such induction. Using the EGR1 promoter linked to reporter molecules, activation of cells can be assessed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1044&rsqb;</number> Particularly, the following protocol is used to assess neuronal activity in PC12 cell lines. PC12 cells (rat phenochromocytoma cells) are known to proliferate and/or differentiate by activation with a number of mitogens, such as TPA (tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate), NGF (nerve growth factor), and EGF (epidermal growth factor). The EGR1 gene expression is activated during this treatment. Thus, by stably transfecting PC12 cells with a construct containing an EGR promoter linked to SEAP reporter, activation of PC12 cells can be assessed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1045&rsqb;</number> The EGR/SEAP reporter construct can be assembled by the following protocol. The EGR-1 promoter sequence (&minus;633 to &plus;1)(Sakamoto K et al., Oncogene 6:867-871 (1991)) can be PCR amplified from human genomic DNA using the following primers:

<paragraph id="P-1068" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;1068&rsqb;</number> High-Throughput Screening Assay Identifying Changes in Small Molecule Concentration and Membrane Permeability </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1069&rsqb;</number> Binding of a ligand to a receptor is known to alter intracellular levels of small molecules, such as calcium, potassium, sodium, and pH, as well as alter membrane potential. These alterations can be measured in an assay to identify supernatants which bind to receptors of a particular cell. Although the following protocol describes an assay for calcium, this protocol can easily be modified to detect changes in potassium, sodium, pH, membrane potential, or any other small molecule which is detectable by a fluorescent probe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1070&rsqb;</number> The following assay uses Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (&ldquo;FLIPR&rdquo;) to measure changes in fluorescent molecules (Molecular Probes) that bind small molecules. Clearly, any fluorescent molecule detecting a small molecule can be used instead of the calcium fluorescent molecule, fluo-4 (Molecular Probes, Inc.; catalog no. F-14202), used here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1071&rsqb;</number> For adherent cells, seed the cells at 10,000-20,000 cells/well in a Co-star black 96-well plate with clear bottom. The plate is incubated in a CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>incubator for 20 hours. The adherent cells are washed two times in Biotek washer with 200 ul of HBSS (Hank&apos;s Balanced Salt Solution) leaving 100 ul of buffer after the final wash. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1072&rsqb;</number> A stock solution of 1 mg/ml fluo-4 is made in 10% pluronic acid DMSO. To load the cells with fluo4 , 50 ul of 12 ug/ml fluo-4 is added to each well. The plate is incubated at 37&deg; C. in a CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>incubator for 60 min. The plate is washed four times in the Biotek washer with HBSS leaving 100 ul of buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1073&rsqb;</number> For non-adherent cells, the cells are spun down from culture media. Cells are re-suspended to 2-5&times; 10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml with HBSS in a 50-ml conical tube. 4 ul of 1 mg/ml fluo-4 solution in 10% pluronic acid DMSO is added to each ml of cell suspension. The tube is then placed in a 37&deg; C. water bath for 30-60 min. The cells are washed twice with HBSS, resuspended to 1&times; 10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml, and dispensed into a microplate, 100 ul/well. The plate is centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The plate is then washed once in Denley CellWash with 200 ul, followed by an aspiration step to 100 ul final volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1074&rsqb;</number> For a non-cell based assay, each well contains a fluorescent molecule, such as fluo-4. The supernatant is added to the well, and a change in fluorescence is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1075&rsqb;</number> To measure the fluorescence of intracellular calcium, the FLIPR is set for the following parameters: (1) System gain is 300-800 mW; (2) Exposure time is 0.4 second; (3) Camera F/stop is F/2; (4) Excitation is 488 nm; (5) Emission is 530 nm; and (6) Sample addition is 50 ul. Increased emission at 530 nm indicates an extracellular signaling event which has resulted in an increase in the intracellular Ca<highlight><superscript>&plus;&plus;</superscript></highlight> concentration. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-1076" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;1076&rsqb;</number> High-Throughput Screening Assay Identifying Tyrosine Kinase Activity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1077&rsqb;</number> The Protein Tyrosine Kinases (PTK) represent a diverse group of transmembrane and cytoplasmic kinases. Within the Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase RPTK) group are receptors for a range of mitogenic and metabolic growth factors including the PDGF, FGF, EGF, NGF, HGF and Insulin receptor subfamilies. In addition there are a large family of RPTKs for which the corresponding ligand is unknown. Ligands for RPTKs include mainly secreted small proteins, but also membrane-bound and extracellular matrix proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1078&rsqb;</number> Activation of RPTK by ligands involves ligand-mediated receptor dimerization, resulting in transphosphorylation of the receptor subunits and activation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases include receptor associated tyrosine kinases of the src-family (e.g., src, yes, lck, lyn, fyn) and non-receptor linked and cytosolic protein tyrosine kinases, such as the Jak family, members of which mediate signal transduction triggered by the cytokine superfamily of receptors (e.g., the Interleukins, Interferons, GM-CSF, and Leptin). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1079&rsqb;</number> Because of the wide range of known factors capable of stimulating tyrosine kinase activity, the identification of novel human secreted proteins capable of activating tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathways are of interest. Therefore, the following protocol is designed to identify those novel human secreted proteins capable of activating the tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1080&rsqb;</number> Seed target cells (e.g., primary keratinocytes) at a density of approximately 25,000 cells per well in a 96 well Loprodyne Silent Screen Plates purchased from Nalge Nunc (Naperville, Ill.). The plates are sterilized with two 30 minute rinses with 100% ethanol, rinsed with water and dried overnight. Some plates are coated for 2 hr with 100 ml of cell culture grade type I collagen (50 mg/ml), gelatin (2%) or polylysine (50 mg/ml), all of which can be purchased from Sigma Chemicals (St. Louis, Mo.) or 10% Matrigel purchased from Becton Dickinson (Bedford, Mass.), or calf serum, rinsed with PBS and stored at 4&deg; C. Cell growth on these plates is assayed by seeding 5,000 cells/well in growth medium and indirect quantitation of cell number through use of alamarBlue as described by the manufacturer Alamar Biosciences, Inc. (Sacramento, Calif.) after 48 hr. Falcon plate covers &num;3071 from Becton Dickinson (Bedford, Mass.) are used to cover the Loprodyne Silent Screen Plates. Falcon Microtest III cell culture plates can also be used in some proliferation experiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1081&rsqb;</number> To prepare extracts, A431 cells are seeded onto the nylon membranes of Loprodyne plates (20,000/200 ml/well) and cultured overnight in complete medium. Cells are quiesced by incubation in serum-free basal medium for 24 hr. After 5-20 minutes treatment with EGF (60 ng/ml) or 50 ul of the supernatant produced in Example 11, the medium was removed and 100 ml of extraction buffer ((20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM Na4P2O7 and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (&num; 1836170) obtained from Boeheringer Mannheim (Indianapolis, Ind.) is added to each well and the plate is shaken on a rotating shaker for 5 minutes at 4&deg; C. The plate is then placed in a vacuum transfer manifold and the extract filtered through the 0.45 mm membrane bottoms of each well using house vacuum. Extracts are collected in a 96-well catch/assay plate in the bottom of the vacuum manifold and immediately placed on ice. To obtain extracts clarified by centrifugation, the content of each well, after detergent solubilization for 5 minutes, is removed and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4&deg; C. at 16,000&times; g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1082&rsqb;</number> Test the filtered extracts for levels of tyrosine kinase activity. Although many methods of detecting tyrosine kinase activity are known, one method is described here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1083&rsqb;</number> Generally, the tyrosine kinase activity of a supernatant is evaluated by determining its ability to phosphorylate a tyrosine residue on a specific substrate (a biotinylated peptide). Biotinylated peptides that can be used for this purpose include PSK1 (corresponding to amino acids 6-20 of the cell division kinase cdc2-p34) and PSK2 (corresponding to amino acids 1-17 of gastrin). Both peptides are substrates for a range of tyrosine kinases and are available from Boehringer Mannheim. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1084&rsqb;</number> The tyrosine kinase reaction is set up by adding the following components in order. First, add 10 ul of 5 uM Biotinylated Peptide, then 10 ul ATP/Mg<highlight><subscript>2&plus;</subscript></highlight> (5 mM ATP/50 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), then 10 ul of 5&times; Assay Buffer (40 mM imidazole hydrochloride, pH7.3, 40 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 1 mM EGTA, 100 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 5 mM MnCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 0.5 mg/ml BSA), then 5 ul of Sodium Vanadate(1 mM), and then 5 ul of water. Mix the components gently and preincubate the reaction mix at 30&deg; C. for 2 min. Initial the reaction by adding 10 ul of the control enzyme or the filtered supernatant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1085&rsqb;</number> The tyrosine kinase assay reaction is then terminated by adding 10 ul of 120 mm EDTA and place the reactions on ice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1086&rsqb;</number> Tyrosine kinase activity is determined by transferring 50 ul aliquot of reaction mixture to a microtiter plate (MTP) module and incubating at 37&deg; C. for 20 min. This allows the streptavadin coated 96 well plate to associate with the biotinylated peptide. Wash the MTP module with 300 ul/well of PBS four times. Next add 75 ul of anti-phospotyrosine antibody conjugated to horse radish peroxidase(anti-P-Tyr-POD(0.5 u/ml)) to each well and incubate at 37&deg; C. for one hour. Wash the well as above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1087&rsqb;</number> Next add 100 ul of peroxidase substrate solution (Boehringer Mannheim) and incubate at room temperature for at least 5 mins (up to 30 min). Measure the absorbance of the sample at 405 nm by using ELISA reader. The level of bound peroxidase activity is quantitated using an ELISA reader and reflects the level of tyrosine kinase activity. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-1088" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;1088&rsqb;</number> High-Throughput Screening Assay Identifying Phosphorylation Activity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1089&rsqb;</number> As a potential alternative and/or compliment to the assay of protein tyrosine kinase activity described in Example 19, an assay which detects activation (phosphorylation) of major intracellular signal transduction intermediates can also be used. For example, as described below one particular assay can detect tyrosine phosphorylation of the Erk-1 and Erk-2 kinases. However, phosphorylation of other molecules, such as Raf, JNK, p38 MAP, Map kinase kinase (MEK), MEK kinase, Src, Muscle specific kinase (MuSK), IRAK, Tec, and Janus, as well as any other phosphoserine, phosphotyrosine, or phosphothreonine molecule, can be detected by substituting these molecules for Erk-1 or Erk-2 in the following assay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1090&rsqb;</number> Specifically, assay plates are made by coating the wells of a 96-well ELISA plate with 0.1 ml of protein G (1 ug/ml) for 2 hr at room temp, (RT). The plates are then rinsed with PBS and blocked with 3% BSAIPBS for 1 hr at RT. The protein G plates are then treated with 2 commercial monoclonal antibodies (100 ng/well) against Erk-1 and Erk-2 (1 hr at RT) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). (To detect other molecules, this step can easily be modified by substituting a monoclonal antibody detecting any of the above described molecules.) After 3-5 rinses with PBS, the plates are stored at 4&deg; C. until use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1091&rsqb;</number> A431 cells are seeded at 20,000/well in a 96-well Loprodyne filterplate and cultured overnight in growth medium. The cells are then starved for 48 hr in basal medium (DMEM) and then treated with EGF (6 ng/well) or 50 ul of the supernatants obtained in Example 11 for 5-20 minutes. The cells are then solubilized and extracts filtered directly into the assay plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1092&rsqb;</number> After incubation with the extract for 1 hr at RT, the wells are again rinsed. As a positive control, a commercial preparation of MAP kinase (10 ng/well) is used in place of A431 extract. Plates are then treated with a commercial polyclonal (rabbit) antibody (1 ug/ml) which specifically recognizes the phosphorylated epitope of the Erk-1 and Erk-2 kinases (1 hr at RT). This antibody is biotinylated by standard procedures. The bound polyclonal antibody is then quantitated by successive incubations with Europium-streptavidin and Europium fluorescence enhancing reagent in the Wallac DELFIA instrument (time-resolved fluorescence). An increased fluorescent signal over background indicates a phosphorylation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-1093" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;1093&rsqb;</number> Method of Determining Alterations in a Gene Corresponding to a Polynucleotide </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1094&rsqb;</number> RNA isolated from entire families or individual patients presenting with a phenotype of interest (such as a disease) is be isolated. cDNA is then generated from these RNA samples using protocols known in the art. (See, Sambrook.) The cDNA is then used as a template for PCR, employing primers surrounding regions of interest in SEQ ID NO:X. Suggested PCR conditions consist of 35 cycles at 95&deg; C. for 30 seconds; 60-120 seconds at 52-58&deg; C.; and 60-120 seconds at 70&deg; C., using buffer solutions described in Sidransky, D., et al., Science 252:706 (1991). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1095&rsqb;</number> PCR products are then sequenced using primers labeled at their 5&prime; end with T4 polynucleotide kinase, employing SequiTherm Polymerase. (Epicentre Technologies). The intron-exon borders of selected exons is also determined and genomnic PCR products analyzed to confirm the results. PCR products harboring suspected mutations is then cloned and sequenced to validate the results of the direct sequencing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1096&rsqb;</number> PCR products is cloned into T-tailed vectors as described in Holton, T. A. and Graham, M. W., Nucleic Acids Research, 19:1156 (1991) and sequenced with T7 polymerase (United States Biochemical). Affected individuals are identified by mutations not present in unaffected individuals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1097&rsqb;</number> Genomic rearrangements are also observed as a method of determining alterations in a gene corresponding to a polynucleotide. Genomic clones isolated according to Example 2 are nick-translated with digoxigenindeoxy-uridine 5&prime;-triphosphate (Boehringer Manheim), and FISH performed as described in Johnson, Cg. et al., Methods Cell Biol. 35:73-99 (1991). Hybridization with the labeled probe is carried out using a vast excess of human cot-1 DNA for specific hybridization to the corresponding genomic locus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1098&rsqb;</number> Chromosomes are counterstained with 4,6-diamino-2-phenylidole and propidium iodide, producing a combination of C- and R-bands. Aligned images for precise mapping are obtained using a triple-band filter set (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, Vt.) in combination with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics, Tucson, Ariz.) and variable excitation wavelength filters. (Johnson, Cv. et al., Genet. Anal. Tech. Appl., 8:75 (1991).) Image collection, analysis and chromosomal fractional length measurements are performed using the ISee Graphical Program System. (Inovision Corporation, Durham, N.C.) Chromosome alterations of the genomic region hybridized by the probe are identified as insertions, deletions, and translocations. These alterations are used as a diagnostic marker for an associated disease. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-1099" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;1099&rsqb;</number> Method of Detecting Abnormal Levels of a Polypeptide in a Biological Sample </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1100&rsqb;</number> A polypeptide of the present invention can be detected in a biological sample, and if an increased or decreased level of the polypeptide is detected, this polypeptide is a marker for a particular phenotype. Methods of detection are numerous, and thus, it is understood that one skilled in the art can modify the following assay to fit their particular needs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1101&rsqb;</number> For example, antibody-sandwich ELISAs are used to detect polypeptides in a sample, preferably a biological sample. Wells of a microtiter plate are coated with specific antibodies, at a final concentration of 0.2 to 10 ug/ml. The antibodies are either monoclonal or polyclonal and are produced by the method described in Example 10. The wells are blocked so that non-specific binding of the polypeptide to the well is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1102&rsqb;</number> The coated wells are then incubated for &gt;2 hours at RT with a sample containing the polypeptide. Preferably, serial dilutions of the sample should be used to validate results. The plates are then washed three times with deionized or distilled water to remove unbounded polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1103&rsqb;</number> Next, 50 ul of specific antibody-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, at a concentration of 25-400 ng, is added and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The plates are again washed three times with deionized or distilled water to remove unbounded conjugate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1104&rsqb;</number> Add 75 ul of 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (MUP) or p-nitrophenyl phosphate (NPP) substrate solution to each well and incubate 1 hour at room temperature. Measure the reaction by a microtiter plate reader. Prepare a standard curve, using serial dilutions of a control sample, and plot polypeptide concentration on the X-axis (log scale) and fluorescence or absorbance of the Y-axis (linear scale). Interpolate the concentration of the polypeptide in the sample using the standard curve. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-1105" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;1105&rsqb;</number> Formulating a Polypeptide </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1106&rsqb;</number> The secreted polypeptide composition will be formulated and dosed in a fashion consistent with good medical practice, taking into account the clinical condition of the individual patient (especially the side effects of treatment with the secreted polypeptide alone), the site of delivery, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to practitioners. The &ldquo;effective amount&rdquo; for purposes herein is thus determined by such considerations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1107&rsqb;</number> As a general proposition, the total pharmaceutically effective amount of secreted polypeptide administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 1 &mgr;g/kg/day to 10 mg/kg/day of patient body weight, although, as noted above, this will be subject to therapeutic discretion. More preferably, this dose is at least 0.01 mg/kg/day, and most preferably for humans between about 0.01 and 1 mg/kg/day for the hormone. If given continuously, the secreted polypeptide is typically administered at a dose rate of about 1 &mgr;g/kg/hour to about 50 &mgr;g/kg/hour, either by 1-4 injections per day or by continuous subcutaneous infusions, for example, using a mini-pump. An intravenous bag solution may also be employed. The length of treatment needed to observe changes and the interval following treatment for responses to occur appears to vary depending on the desired effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1108&rsqb;</number> Pharmaceutical compositions containing the secreted protein of the invention are administered orally, rectally, parenterally, intracistemally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, gels, drops or transdermal patch), bucally, or as an oral or nasal spray. &ldquo;Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&rdquo; refers to a non-toxic solid, semisolid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. The term &ldquo;parenteral&rdquo; as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1109&rsqb;</number> The secreted polypeptide is also suitably administered by sustained-release systems. Suitable examples of sustained-release compositions include semi-permeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or mirocapsules. Sustained-release matrices include polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919, EP 58,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman, U. et al., Biopolymers 22:547-556 (1983)), poly (2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (R. Langer et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 15:167-277 (1981), and R. Langer, Chem. Tech. 12:98-105 (1982)), ethylene vinyl acetate (R. Langer et al.) or poly-D-(&minus;)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988). Sustained-release compositions also include liposomally entrapped polypeptides. Liposomes containing the secreted polypeptide are prepared by methods known per se: DE 3,218,121; Epstein et al., Proc.

Ordinarily, the liposomes are of the small (about 200-800 Angstroms) unilamellar type in which the lipid content is greater than about 30 mol. percent cholesterol, the selected proportion being adjusted for the optimal secreted polypeptide therapy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1110&rsqb;</number> For parenteral administration, in one embodiment, the secreted polypeptide is formulated generally by mixing it at the desired degree of purity, in a unit dosage injectable form (solution, suspension, or emulsion), with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, i.e., one that is non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and is compatible with other ingredients of the formulation. For example, the formulation preferably does not include oxidizing agents and other compounds that are known to be deleterious to polypeptides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1111&rsqb;</number> Generally, the formulations are prepared by contacting the polypeptide uniformly and intimately with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. Then, if necessary, the product is shaped into the desired formulation. Preferably the carrier is a parenteral carrier, more preferably a solution that is isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Examples of such carrier vehicles include water, saline, Ringer&apos;s solution, and dextrose solution. Non-aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils and ethyl oleate are also useful herein, as well as liposomes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1112&rsqb;</number> The carrier suitably contains minor amounts of additives such as substances that enhance isotonicity and chemical stability. Such materials are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, succinate, acetic acid, and other organic acids or their salts; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about ten residues) polypeptides, e.g., polyarginine or tripeptides; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids, such as glycine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or arginine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including cellulose or its derivatives, glucose, manose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; counterions such as sodium; and/or nonionic surfactants such as polysorbates, poloxamers, or PEG. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1113&rsqb;</number> The secreted polypeptide is typically formulated in such vehicles at a concentration of about 0.1 mg/ml to 100 mg/ml, preferably 1-10 mg/ml, at a pH of about 3 to 8. It will be understood that the use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of polypeptide salts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1114&rsqb;</number> Any polypeptide to be used for therapeutic administration can be sterile. Sterility is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes (e.g., 0.2 micron membranes). Therapeutic polypeptide compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1115&rsqb;</number> Polypeptides ordinarily will be stored in unit or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampoules or vials, as an aqueous solution or as a lyophilized formulation for reconstitution. As an example of a lyophilized formulation, 10-mil vials are filled with 5 ml of sterile-filtered 1% (w/v) aqueous polypeptide solution, and the resulting mixture is lyophilized. The infusion solution is prepared by reconstituting the lyophilized polypeptide using bacteriostatic Water-for-Injection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1116&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration. In addition, the polypeptides of the present invention may be employed in conjunction with other therapeutic compounds. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-1118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1118&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that conditions caused by a decrease in the standard or normal expression level of a secreted protein in an individual can be treated by administering the polypeptide of the present invention, preferably in the secreted form. Thus, the invention also provides a method of treatment of an individual in need of an increased level of the polypeptide comprising administering to such an individual a pharmaceutical composition comprising an amount of the polypeptide to increase the activity level of the polypeptide in such an individual. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1119&rsqb;</number> For example, a patient with decreased levels of a polypeptide receives a daily dose 0.1-100 ug/kg of the polypeptide for six consecutive days. Preferably, the polypeptide is in the secreted form. The exact details of the dosing scheme, based on administration and formulation, are provided in Example 23. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-1121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1121&rsqb;</number> Antisense technology is used to inhibit production of a polypeptide of the present invention. This technology is one example of a method of decreasing levels of a polypeptide, preferably a secreted form, due to a variety of etiologies, such as cancer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1122&rsqb;</number> For example, a patient diagnosed with abnormally increased levels of a polypeptide is administered intravenously antisense polynucleotides at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 mg/kg day for 21 days. This treatment is repeated after a 7-day rest period if the treatment was well tolerated. The formulation of the antisense polynucleotide is provided in Example 23. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-1124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1124&rsqb;</number> One method of gene therapy transplants fibroblasts, which are capable of expressing a polypeptide, onto a patient. Generally, fibroblasts are obtained from a subject by skin biopsy. The resulting tissue is placed in tissue-culture medium and separated into small pieces. Small chunks of the tissue are placed on a wet surface of a tissue culture flask, approximately ten pieces are placed in each flask. The flask is turned upside down, closed tight and left at room temperature over night. After 24 hours at room temperature, the flask is inverted and the chunks of tissue remain fixed to the bottom of the flask and fresh media (e.g., Ham&apos;s F12 media, with 10% FBS, penicillin and streptomycin) is added. The flasks are then incubated at 37&deg; C. for approximately one week. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1125&rsqb;</number> At this time, fresh media is added and subsequently changed every several days. After an additional two weeks in culture, a monolayer of fibroblasts emerge. The monolayer is trypsinized and scaled into larger flasks. pMV-7 (Kirschmeier, P. T. et al., DNA, 7:219-25 (1988)), flanked by the long terminal repeats of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus, is digested with EcoRI and HindIII and subsequently treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. The linear vector is fractionated on agarose gel and purified, using glass beads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1126&rsqb;</number> The cDNA encoding a polypeptide of the present invention can be amplified using PCR primers which correspond to the 5&prime; and 3&prime; end sequences respectively as set forth in Example 1. Preferably, the 5&prime; primer contains an EcoRI site and the 3&prime; primer includes a HindII site. Equal quantities of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus linear backbone and the amplified EcoRI and HindIII fragment are added together, in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The resulting mixture is maintained under conditions appropriate for ligation of the two fragments. The ligation mixture is then used to transform bacteria HB101, which are then plated onto agar containing kanamycin for the purpose of confirming that the vector has the gene of interest properly inserted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1127&rsqb;</number> The amphotropic pA317 or GP&plus;am12 packaging cells are grown in tissue culture to confluent density in Dulbecco&apos;s Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) with 10% calf serum (CS), penicillin and streptomycin. The MSV vector containing the gene is then added to the media and the packaging cells transduced with the vector. The packaging cells now produce infectious viral particles containing the gene (the packaging cells are now referred to as producer cells). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1128&rsqb;</number> Fresh media is added to the transduced producer cells, and subsequently, the media is harvested from a 10 cm plate of confluent producer cells. The spent media, containing the infectious viral particles, is filtered through a millipore filter to remove detached producer cells and this media is then used to infect fibroblast cells. Media is removed from a sub-confluent plate of fibroblasts and quickly replaced with the media from the producer cells. This media is removed and replaced with fresh media. If the titer of virus is high, then virtually all fibroblasts will be infected and no selection is required. If the titer is very low, then it is necessary to use a retroviral vector that has a selectable marker, such as neo or his. Once the fibroblasts have been efficiently infected, the fibroblasts are analyzed to determine whether protein is produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1129&rsqb;</number> The engineered fibroblasts are then transplanted onto the host, either alone or after having been grown to confluence on cytodex 3 microcarrier beads. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-1130" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;1130&rsqb;</number> Method of Treatment Using Gene Therapy&mdash;in vivo </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1131&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is using in vivo gene therapy methods to treat disorders, diseases and conditions. The gene therapy method relates to the introduction of naked nucleic acid (DNA, RNA, and antisense DNA or RNA) sequences into an animal to increase or decrease the expression of the polypeptide. The polynucleotide of the present invention may be operatively linked to a promoter or any other genetic elements necessary for the expression of the polypeptide by the target tissue. Such gene therapy and delivery techniques and methods are known in the art, see, for example, WO90/11092, WO98/11779; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,693,622, 5,705,151, 5,580,859; Tabata H. et al. (1997) Cardiovasc. Res. 35(3):470-479, Chao J et al. (1997) Pharmacol. Res. 35(6):517-522, Wolff J. A. (1997) Neuromuscul. Disord. 7(5):314-318, Schwartz B. et al. (1996) Gene Ther. 3(5):405-411, Tsurumi Y. et al. (1996) Circulation 94(12):3281-3290 (incorporated herein by reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1132&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotide constructs may be delivered by any method that delivers injectable materials to the cells of an animal, such as, injection into the interstitial space of tissues (heart, muscle, skin, lung, liver, intestine and the like). The polynucleotide constructs can be delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or aqueous carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1133&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;naked&rdquo; polynucleotide, DNA or RNA, refers to sequences that are free from any delivery vehicle that acts to assist, promote, or facilitate entry into the cell, including viral sequences, viral particles, liposome formulations, lipofectin or precipitating agents and the like. However, the polynucleotides of the present invention may also be delivered in liposome formulations (such as those taught in Felgner P. L. et al. (1995) Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 772:126-139 and Abdallah B. et al. (1995) Biol. Cell 85(1):1-7) which can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1134&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotide vector constructs used in the gene therapy method are preferably constructs that will not integrate into the host genome nor will they contain sequences that allow for replication. Any strong promoter known to those skilled in the art can be used for driving the expression of DNA. Unlike other gene therapies techniques, one major advantage of introducing naked nucleic acid sequences into target cells is the transitory nature of the polynucleotide synthesis in the cells. Studies have shown that non-replicating DNA sequences can be introduced into cells to provide production of the desired polypeptide for periods of up to six months. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1135&rsqb;</number> The polynucleotide construct can be delivered to the interstitial space of tissues within the an animal, including of muscle, skin, brain, lung, liver, spleen, bone marrow, thymus, heart, lymph, blood, bone, cartilage, pancreas, kidney, gall bladder, stomach, intestine, testis, ovary, uterus, rectum, nervous system, eye, gland, and connective tissue. Interstitial space of the tissues comprises the intercellular fluid, mucopolysaccharide matrix among the reticular fibers of organ tissues, elastic fibers in the walls of vessels or chambers, collagen fibers of fibrous tissues, or that same matrix within connective tissue ensheathing muscle cells or in the lacunae of bone. It is similarly the space occupied by the plasma of the circulation and the lymph fluid of the lymphatic channels. Delivery to the interstitial space of muscle tissue is preferred for the reasons discussed below. They may be conveniently delivered by injection into the tissues comprising these cells. They are preferably delivered to and expressed in persistent, non-dividing cells which are differentiated, although delivery and expression may be achieved in non-differentiated or less completely differentiated cells, such as, for example, stem cells of blood or skin fibroblasts. In vivo muscle cells are particularly competent in their ability to take up and express polynucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1136&rsqb;</number> For the naked polynucleotide injection, an effective dosage amount of DNA or RNA will be in the range of from about 0.05 g/kg body weight to about 50 mg/kg body weight. Preferably the dosage will be from about 0.005 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg and more preferably from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg. Of course, as the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate, this dosage will vary according to the tissue site of injection. The appropriate and effective dosage of nucleic acid sequence can readily be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art and may depend on the condition being treated and the route of administration. The preferred route of administration is by the parenteral route of injection into the interstitial space of tissues. However, other parenteral routes may also be used, such as, inhalation of an aerosol formulation particularly for delivery to lungs or bronchial tissues, throat or mucous membranes of the nose. In addition, naked polynucleotide constructs can be delivered to arteries during angioplasty by the catheter used in the procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1137&rsqb;</number> The dose response effects of injected polynucleotide in muscle in vivo is determined as follows. Suitable template DNA for production of mRNA coding for polypeptide of the present invention is prepared in accordance with a standard recombinant DNA methodology. The template DNA, which may be either circular or linear, is either used as naked DNA or complexed with liposomes. The quadriceps muscles of mice are then injected with various amounts of the template DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1138&rsqb;</number> Five to six week old female and male Balb/C mice are anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 0.3 ml of 2.5% Avertin. A 1.5 cm incision is made on the anterior thigh, and the quadriceps muscle is directly visualized. The template DNA is injected in 0.1 ml of carrier in a 1 cc syringe through a 27 gauge needle over one minute, approximately 0.5 cm from the distal insertion site of the muscle into the knee and about 0.2 cm deep. A suture is placed over the injection site for future localization. and the skin is closed with stainless steel clips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1139&rsqb;</number> After an appropriate incubation time (e.g., 7 days) muscle extracts are prepared by excising the entire quadriceps. Every fifth 15 um cross-section of the individual quadriceps muscles is histochemically stained for protein expression. A time course for protein expression may be done in a similar fashion except that quadriceps from different mice are harvested at different times. Persistence of DNA in muscle following injection may be determined by Southern blot analysis after preparing total cellular DNA and HIRT supernatants from injected and control mice. The results of the above experimentation in mice can be use to extrapolate proper dosages and other treatment parameters in humans and other animals using naked DNA. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-1140" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;1140&rsqb;</number> Transgenic Animals </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1141&rsqb;</number> The polypeptides of the invention can also be expressed in transgenic animals. Animals of any species, including, but not limited to, mice, rats, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, pigs, micro-pigs, goats, sheep, cows and non-human primates, e.g., baboons, monkeys, and chimpanzees may be used to generate transgenic animals. In a specific embodiment, techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art, are used to express polypeptides of the invention in humans, as part of a gene therapy protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1142&rsqb;</number> Any technique known in the art may be used to introduce the transgene (i.e., polynucleotides of the invention) into animals to produce the founder lines of transgenic animals. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, pronuclear microinjection (Paterson et al., Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 40:691-698 (1994); Carver et al., Biotechnology (NY) 11:1263-1270 (1993); Wright et al., Biotechnology (NY) 9:830-834 (1991); and Hoppe et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,191 (1989)); retrovirus mediated gene transfer into germ lines (Van der Putten et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 82:6148-6152 (1985)), blastocysts or embryos; gene targeting in embryonic stem cells (Thompson et al., Cell 56:313-321 (1989)); electroporation of cells or embryos (Lo, 1983, Mol Cell. Biol. 3:1803-1814 (1983)); introduction of the polynucleotides of the invention using a gene gun (see, e.g., Ulmer et al., Science 259:1745 (1993); introducing nucleic acid constructs into embryonic pleuripotent stem cells and transferring the stem cells back into the blastocyst; and sperm-mediated gene transfer (Lavitrano et al., Cell 57:717-723 (1989); etc. For a review of such techniques, see Gordon, &ldquo;Transgenic Animals,&rdquo; Intl. Rev. Cytol. 115:171-229 (1989), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1143&rsqb;</number> Any technique known in the art may be used to produce transgenic clones containing polynucleotides of the invention, for example, nuclear transfer into enucleated oocytes of nuclei from cultured embryonic, fetal, or adult cells induced to quiescence (Campell et al., Nature 380:64-66 (1996); Wilmut et al., Nature 385:810-813 (1997)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1144&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides for transgenic animals that carry the transgene in all their cells, as well as animals which carry the transgene in some, but not all their cells, i.e., mosaic animals or chimeric. The transgene may be integrated as a single transgene or as multiple copies such as in concatamers, e.g., head-to-head tandems or head-to-tall tandems. The transgene may also be selectively introduced into and activated in a particular cell type by following, for example, the teaching of Lasko et al. (Lasko et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:6232-6236 (1992)). The regulatory sequences required for such a cell-type specific activation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest, and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. When it is desired that the polynucleotide transgene be integrated into the chromosomal site of the endogenous gene, gene targeting is preferred. Briefly, when such a technique is to be utilized, vectors containing some nucleotide sequences homologous to the endogenous gene are designed for the purpose of integrating, via homologous recombination with chromosomal sequences, into and disrupting the function of the nucleotide sequence of the endogenous gene. The transgene may also be selectively introduced into a particular cell type, thus inactivating the endogenous gene in only that cell type, by following, for example, the teaching of Gu et al. (Gu et al., Science 265:103-106 (1994)). The regulatory sequences required for such a cell-type specific inactivation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest, and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1145&rsqb;</number> Once transgenic animals have been generated, the expression of the recombinant gene may be assayed utilizing standard techniques. Initial screening may be accomplished by Southern blot analysis or PCR techniques to analyze animal tissues to verify that integration of the transgene has taken place. The level of mRNA expression of the transgene in the tissues of the transgenic animals may also be assessed using techniques which include, but are not limited to, Northern blot analysis of tissue samples obtained from the animal, in sitLu hybridization analysis, and reverse transcriptase-PCR (rt-PCR). Samples of transgenic gene-expressing tissue may also be evaluated immunocytochemically or immunohistochemically using antibodies specific for the transgene product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1146&rsqb;</number> Once the founder animals are produced, they may be bred, inbred, outbred, or crossbred to produce colonies of the particular animal. Examples of such breeding strategies include, but are not limited to: outbreeding of founder animals with more than one integration site in order to establish separate lines; inbreeding of separate lines in order to produce compound transgenics that express the transgene at higher levels because of the effects of additive expression of each transgene; crossing of heterozygous transgenic animals to produce animals homozygous for a given integration site in order to both augment expression and eliminate the need for screening of animals by DNA analysis; crossing of separate homozygous lines to produce compound heterozygous or homozygous lines; and breeding to place the transgene on a distinct background that is appropriate for an experimental model of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1147&rsqb;</number> Transgenic animals of the invention have uses which include, but are not limited to, animal model systems useful in elaborating the biological function of polypeptides of the present invention, studying conditions and/or disorders associated with aberrant expression, and in screening for compounds effective in ameliorating such conditions and/or disorders. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-1148" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;1148&rsqb;</number> Knock-Out Animals </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1149&rsqb;</number> Endogenous gene expression can also be reduced by inactivating or &ldquo;knocking out&rdquo; the gene and/or its promoter using targeted homologous recombination. (E.g., see Smithies et al., Nature 317:230-234 (1985); Thomas &amp; Capecchi, Cell 51:503-512 (1987); Thompson et al., Cell 5:313-321 (1989); each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). For example, a mutant, non-functional polynucleotide of the invention (or a completely unrelated DNA sequence) flanked by DNA homologous to the endogenous polynucleotide sequence (either the coding regions or regulatory regions of the gene) can be used, with or without a selectable marker and/or a negative selectable marker, to transfect cells that express polypeptides of the invention in vivo. In another embodiment, techniques known in the art are used to generate knockouts in cells that contain, but do not express the gene of interest. Insertion of the DNA construct, via targeted homologous recombination, results in inactivation of the targeted gene. Such approaches are particularly suited in research and agricultural fields where modifications to embryonic stem cells can be used to generate animal offspring with an inactive targeted gene (e.g., see Thomas &amp; Capecchi 1987 and Thompson 1989, supra). However this approach can be routinely adapted for use in humans provided the recombinant DNA constructs are directly administered or targeted to the required site in vivo using appropriate viral vectors that will be apparent to those of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1150&rsqb;</number> In further embodiments of the invention, cells that are genetically engineered to express the polypeptides of the invention, or alternatively, that are genetically engineered not to express the polypeptides of the invention (e.g., knockouts) are administered to a patient in vivo. Such cells may be obtained from the patient (i.e., animal, including human) or an MHC compatible donor and can include, but are not limited to fibroblasts, bone marrow cells, blood cells (e.g., lymphocytes), adipocytes, muscle cells, endothelial cells etc. The cells are genetically engineered in vitro using recombinant DNA techniques to introduce the coding sequence of polypeptides of the invention into the cells, or alternatively, to disrupt the coding sequence and/or endogenous regulatory sequence associated with the polypeptides of the invention, e.g., by transduction (using viral vectors, and preferably vectors that integrate the transgene into the cell genome) or transfection procedures, including, but not limited to, the use of plasmids, cosmids, YACs, naked DNA, electroporation, liposomes, etc. The coding sequence of the polypeptides of the invention can be placed under the control of a strong constitutive or inducible promoter or promoter/enhancer to achieve expression, and preferably secretion, of the polypeptides of the invention. The engineered cells which express and preferably secrete the polypeptides of the invention can be introduced . into the patient systemically, e.g., in the circulation, or intraperitoneally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1151&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the cells can be incorporated into a matrix and implanted in the body, e.g., genetically engineered fibroblasts can be implanted as part of a skin graft; genetically engineered endothelial cells can be implanted as part of a lymphatic or vascular graft. (See, for example, Anderson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,349; and Mulligan &amp; Wilson, U.S. Pat. No. 5,460,959 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1152&rsqb;</number> When the cells to be administered are non-autologous or non-MHC compatible cells, they can be administered using well known techniques which prevent the development of a host immune response against the introduced cells. For example, the cells may be introduced in an encapsulated form which, while allowing for an exchange of components with the immediate extracellular environment, does not allow the introduced cells to be recognized by the host immune system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1153&rsqb;</number> Transgenic and &ldquo;knock-out&rdquo; animals of the invention have uses which include, but are not limited to, animal model systems useful in elaborating the biological function of polypeptides of the present invention, studying conditions and/or disorders associated with aberrant expression, and in screening for compounds effective in ameliorating such conditions and/or disorders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-1154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;1154&rsqb;</number> It will be clear that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as particularly described in the foregoing description and examples. Numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and, therefore, are within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
