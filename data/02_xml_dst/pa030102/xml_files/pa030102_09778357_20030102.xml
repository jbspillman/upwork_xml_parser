<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a logging into place tool. More particularly, the present invention relates to a logging into place tool having a gamma-ray tool and an electromagnetic telemetry tool attached to a drill stem test string. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A drill-stem test (DST) system is commonly used in connection with hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation. The primary purpose of the DST is to obtain a maximum stabilized reservoir pressure, a stabilized flow rate, and representative samples formation fluids and gasses. The hydrocarbon reservoir&apos;s potential is evaluated utilizing various reservoir engineering calculations and the collected data/information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Drill stem test systems commonly have a multi-section housing which contains or supports a number of test-related devices, which collectively may be referred to as the drill stem test tool or DST tool. The housing sections are formed with internal conduits which, when the housing sections are assembled, co-operate to define a network of fluid flow paths required for the testing procedure. The housing sections are assembled at the surface and then lowered on the end of the drill string (e.g., drill pipes or tubings) to the desired test depth corresponding to a prospective zone of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Inflatable (or otherwise expandable) packers carried by certain of the housing sections engage the wellbore to isolate a test region. A single packer may be provided if only the bottom of the wellbore is to be tested, but it is common practice to provide a pair of packers which permit a test region intermediate of the top and bottom of the wellbore to be isolated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For conventional testing, weight may be set down on the drill string to expand the packers against the wellbore. For inflate testing, a pump may be positioned in the drill-stem test string to pump wellbore drill fluid (commonly referred to as &ldquo;mud&rdquo;) into the packers for inflation. Once the packers are set, a test valve is opened to introduce a flow of fluid from the test region into one of the channels formed in the drill stem test string. Upon completion of the initial flow period, the test valve is then closed (i.e., shut-in) to allow the formation to recover and build back to its original shut-in pressure. Repetitive flows and shut-ins are routinely performed to gather additional reservoir evaluation data. The drill stem test system is then retrieved to permit interpretation of the recorded pressure and temperature data and analysis of the fluids and/or gas samples trapped by the DST tool during the flow period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Typically, the DST tool is conveyed downhole using tubing or drill-pipe to a prospective zone of interest based upon previously measured depth and formation correlation from open hole wireline logs, e.g., a gamma-ray well log. However, during the process of conveying the DST tool with tubing or drill-pipe, improper or inaccurate measurements of the length of the drill string may take place due to inconsistent lengths of collars and drill-pipes, pipe stretch, pipe tabulation errors, etc., resulting in erroneous placement of the DST tool. Thus, DST tests may be performed in the wrong zone of interest, and incorrect decisions may result as to whether the formations being tested is a hydrocarbon-bearing formation. Furthermore, repeating the drill-stem test may be very costly both in expenses and time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a need exists for an apparatus and method for accurately logging a drill-stem test tool into place as the DST tool is conveyed by drill pipe or tubing to the desired location. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of a well testing system incorporating a drill stem test tool, an electromagnetic telemetry tool having a gamma ray tool according to the invention. The gamma ray tool and the electromagnetic telemetry tool instrumentation may be encapsulated in a pressure housing mounted within a drill-stem test tool. The well testing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> generally comprises a surface unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a downhole test string <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The surface unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may include one or more processors, computers, controllers, data acquisition systems, signal transmitter/receiver or transceivers, interfaces, power supplies and/or power generators and other components. In one embodiment, the surface unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is housed in a mobile truck. An antenna <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, such as a metal ground stake or other receiving instrumentation may be disposed or driven into the ground and connected to the surface unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to receive and/or transmit signals to and/or from components in the downhole test string <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the antenna <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is disposed at about 100 feet (radial distance) away from the surface unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with another connection from the surface unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the Blow Out Preventor (BOP) or other electrically conductive path to the drill string. The downhole string <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of drill-pipe or tubing <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, an electromagnetic telemetry tool having a gamma ray tool attached thereon <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, one or more packers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and a drill stem test (DST) tool <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The plurality of drill-pipe or tubing <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are connected from the surface to extend to the other components of the test string downhole. The electromagnetic telemetry tool <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> includes a transceiver for communicating with the surface unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The one or more packers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> provide a sealed section of the zone of interest in the wellbore to be tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of an electromagnetic telemetry tool having a gamma ray tool according to the invention. The electromagnetic telemetry tool <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> generally includes a pressure and temperature sensor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, a power ampifier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, a downlink receiver <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, a central processing unit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, a gamma ray tool <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, and a battery unit <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. The electromagnetic telemetry tool <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is selectively controlled by signals from the surface unit to operate in a pressure/temperature sensing mode which provides for a record of pressure versus time or in a gamma ray mode which records gamma counts as the DST tool is raised or lowered past a correlative formation marker. The record of gamma counts is then transmitted to surface and merged with the surface system depth/time management software to produce a gamma-ray mini-log which is later compared to the wireline open-hole gamma ray log to evaluate the exact drill stem test tool depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The gamma ray tool <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, includes a radiation detector <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> for detecting naturally occurring gamma radiation from the formation. The detector <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> is of a type appropriate to the detection of gamma radiation and the production of an electrical signal corresponding to each detected gamma ray and having an amplitude representative of the energy of the gamma ray. The detector <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> includes a scintillation crystal or scintillator <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> which is optically coupled to a photomultiplier tube (PMT) <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>. The scintillator <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may comprise a gadolinium-containing material, such as gadolinium orthosilicate that is suitably doped, for example with cerium, to activate for use as a scintillator. The quantity of cerium in terms of number of atoms is typically of the order of about 0.1% to about 1% of the quantity of gadolinium. The scintillator may comprise other materials, such as sodium iodide doped with thalium (Nal)(Tl), bismuth germanate, cesium iodide, and other materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Electrical power for the gamma ray tool <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is supplied from the battery unit <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. The gamma ray tool <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> includes power conditioning circuitry (not shown) for feeding power at appropriate voltage and current levels to the detector <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> and other downhole circuits. These circuits include an amplifier <highlight><bold>268</bold></highlight> and associated circuitry which receives the output pulses from photomultiplier tube (PMT) <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>. The amplified pulses are then applied to a pulse height analyzer (PHA) <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> which includes an analog-to-digital converter which may be of any conventional type such as the single ramp (Wilkinson rundown) type. Other suitable analog to digital converters may be used for the gamma ray energy range to be analyzed. Linear gating circuits may also be employed for control of the time portion of the detector signal frame to be analyzed. Improved performance can be obtained by the use of additional conventional techniques such as pulse pile-up rejection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The pulse height analyzer <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> may assign each detector pulse to one of a number (typically in the range 256 to 8000) of predetermined channels according to its amplitude (i.e., the gamma ray energy), and produces a signal in suitable digital form representing the channel or amplitude of each analyzed pulse. Typically, the pulse height analyzer <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> includes memory in which the occurrences of each channel number in the digital signal are accumulated to provide an energy spectrum. The accumulated totals are then transferred via a buffer memory <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> (which can be omitted in certain circumstances) to the telemetry interface circuits <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> for transmission to the surface equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> At the surface, the signals are received by the signal processing circuits, which may be of any suitable known construction for encoding and decoding, multiplexing and demultiplexing, amplifying and otherwise processing the signals for transmission to and reception by the surface equipment. The operation of the gamma ray tool <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is controlled by signals sent downhole from the surface equipment. These signals are received by a tool programmer <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> which transmits control signals to the detector <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> and the pulse height analyzer <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The surface equipment includes various electronic circuits used to process the data received from the downhole equipment, analyze the energy spectrum of the detected gamma radiation, extract therefrom information about the formation and any hydrocarbons that it may contain, and produce a tangible record or log of some or all of this data and information, for example on film, paper or tape. These circuits may comprise special purpose hardware or alternatively a general purpose computer appropriately programmed to perform the same tasks as such hardware. The data/information may also be displayed on a monitor and/or saved in a storage medium, such as disk or a cassette. The surface system may also include a depth-measuring system for measuring a depth position of the drill string/tubing or a component on the drill string. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a schematic of one embodiment of a test string incorporating an inflatable straddle, drill stem test tool having an electromagnetic telemetry tool and a gamma ray tool according to the invention. The test string <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of drill pipe sections <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> that extend from the surface. A plurality of components may be attached to the test string to perform the drill stem test for particular well conditions. For example, the test string may comprise an inflatable straddle assembly for testing a particular section of the wellbore.

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a schematic diagram of one embodiment of a logging into place system. The logging into place system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes a downhole system <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and a surface system <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. In relation to the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and the downhole system <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> includes the downhole test string <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Referring to the block diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the downhole system <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> includes a drill stem test string <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>, a gamma-ray tool <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, central processing unit <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, a modulator <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, a pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, a power amplifier <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, and a transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. One or more of these components may be housed in the telemetry tool <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> (in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). The DST string <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight> provides for mechanical manipulation at surface to open and close downhole valves and also allow for surface manipulation in order to inflate the downhole pump in order to inflate packers against the wellbore. Housed within the DST string is the electromagnetic telemetry system with a gamma ray tool controlled by signals transmitted from the surface system. A command is transmitted from surface to downhole to start recording and storing to memory a record of gamma counts as the tool is conveyed up or down past a correlative marker (formation). As time and conveyed depth measurements are stored at surface by the surface system, the measurements are correlated to the downhole gamma counts after being transmitted. A mini gamma ray log is generated and compared to the wireline open-hole for drill-pipe conveyed depth versus the log depth from the original wireline open hole log.

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating one embodiment of a method <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> for logging into place a DST tool according to the invention. To begin the logging into place method <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, the DST tool is conveyed downhole into the wellbore with the electromagnetic telemetry tool and gamma ray tool. A plurality of drill pipes or tubings are connected onto the drill string until the measured depth is reached. (step <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>) As the drill string is lowered into the wellbore past the prospective correlative formation, the tool is stopped and a downlink command from the surface system is sent ordering the gamma ray tool to start recording data to memory. (step <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>) The drill string is then raised, for example, at a rate of approximately 5 meters per minute, to record gamma counts as the gamma ray tool passes by differing lithologies. After a distance of approximately 30 meters has logged, the complete record of downhole gamma counts is transmitted to surface. (step <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>) A partial log (or mini log) is generated by merging the recorded surface depth/time records with the downhole gamma count record. (step <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>) The partial log is then compared to a previously produced well log (e.g., open-hole gamma-ray log) and correlated to the same marker formation. (step <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight>) As the open hole gamma-ray log is considered correct, a depth position adjustment, if necessary, is calculated based on the comparison of the partial log to the open hole gamma-ray log. The drill-string is moved up or down by adding or removing drill pipe(s) or tubing(s) to adjust the position of the DST tool. (step <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>) After the DST tool has been logged into place at a correct depth, the drill stem test may commence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The drill stem test provides reservoir data under dynamic conditions, including stabilized shut-in formation pressures, flow pressures and rates. The DST also records temperature measurements and collects representative samples of the formation fluids. Additionally, the drill stem test also provides for data to calculate reservoir characteristics including but not limited to permeability, well bore damage, maximum reservoir pressure, reservoir depletion or drawdown, radius of investigation, anomaly indications, and other qualitative and quantitative information regarding the well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> While the foregoing is directed to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow. </paragraph>
