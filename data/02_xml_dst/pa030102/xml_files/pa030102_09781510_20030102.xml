<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), to the production of LIF in substantially pure form, and to the cloning and expression of recombinant LIF. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Mature blood cells are produced by the clonal proliferation and concomitant differentiation of immature precursor cells (Metcalf, D. (1984) <highlight><italic>The Hemopoetic Colony Stimulating Factors, </italic></highlight>Elsevier, Amsterdam.). For normal haemopoietic cells, the two processes of proliferation and differentiation are tightly coupled so that the short-lived mature cells are continually replenished. At least four biochemically distinct growth factors, the colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), have been shown in vitro to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of precursor cells of granulocytes and macrophages: G-CSF, M-CSF, GM-CSF and Multi-CSF (IL-3) (see Metcalf, D. (1987), Proc. R. Soc. B. 230, 389-423, for review). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In contrast to normal cells, leukaemic myeloid cells are characterized by an uncoupling of proliferation and differentiation so that immature progenitor cells accumulate, retain their proliferative capacity and fail to differentiate. There has been considerable controversy concerning the nature of biological factors that are able to induce the differentiation of myeloid leukaemic cells in vitro and whether certain factors are capable of inducing differentiation in the absence of proliferation. Indeed, it has been proposed that the events of proliferation and differentiation are necessarily mediated by different factors (Sachs, L. (1982), <highlight><italic>J. Cell. Physiol. Suppl., </italic></highlight>1, 151-164). On the one hand, two groups have described and purified an activity (MGI-2 or D-factor) capable of inducing the differentiation of the murine myeloid leukaemic cell line M1, that does not stimulate the proliferation of normal progenitor cells (Lipton, J. H. and Sachs, L. (1981), <highlight><italic>Biochem. Biophys. Acta. </italic></highlight>673, 552-569; Tomida, M., Yamamoto-Yamaguchi, Y., and Hozumi, M. (1984) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>259 , 10978-10982). On the other hand, the present inventors have previously shown that one of the CSFs, G-CSF, is a strong differentiation-inducing stimulus for the murine myeloid leukaemic cell line, WEHI-3B D<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, as well as being a proliferative and differentiative stimulus for normal cells (Nicola, N. A., Metcalf, D., Matsumoto, M. and Johnson, G. R. (1983), <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>258, 9017-9023). Moreover, Tomida, et.al. (Tomida, M., Yamamoto-Yamaguchi, Y., Hozumi, M., Okabe, T. and Takaka, F. (1986), <highlight><italic>FEBS Lett., </italic></highlight>207, 271-275) have shown that recombinant G-CSF is also able to induce the macrophage differentiation of M1 cells. The relationship between these factors has been a matter of debate. The situation was further complicated by the finding that tumour necrosis factor a(TNF&agr;) is capable of stimulating the differentiation of the human myeloblastic cell line ML-1 (Takeda, K., Iwamoto, S., Sugimoto, H., Takuma,T., Kawatani, N., Noda, M., Masaki, A., Morise, H., Arimura, H. and Konno, K. (1986) <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>323, 338-340). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In an attempt to resolve the discrepancies between the data of these groups, the present inventors have biochemically fractionated the medium conditioned by Krebs II ascites tumour cells used in a number of previous studies and shown it to contain not only authentic G-CSF and GM-CSF, active on normal progenitor cells as well as WEHI-3B D<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> cells, but also two biochemically distinct, but functionally similar, factors capable of inducing the differentiation of M1 cells. These latter factors have been termed leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-A and LIF-B because of their ability to suppress the proliferation of M1 leukaemic cells in vitro and it has been shown that they do not induce the differentiation of WEHI-3B D<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> cells and do not stimulate the proliferation of normal granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cells. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the present investigation of LIF, in particular with a view to providing alternative sources of this glycoprotein of both murine and human origin to enable use in clinical and other applications, murine LIF has been purified from Krebs II ascites tumour cells by an efficient purification procedure and has been subjected to partial amino acid sequence analysis as a first step towards chemical or biosynthetic production of this factor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> LIF radioactively derivatized with I<highlight><superscript>125 </superscript></highlight>has been used in a receptor competition assay to identify cells and tissues of murine and human origin that synthesize and produce LIF. As a result of this survey, a recombinant DNA library of DNA copies of mRNA from one of these sources has been screened and murine LIF-encoding clones identified by hybridization with radioactively-labelled oligonucleotides encoding portions of the previously determined murine LIF amino acid sequence, and the aforementioned murine LIF cDNA clones subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. Moreover, the cloned murine LIF encoding sequence has been used as a hybridization probe to identify a human gene encoding a homologue of murine LIF and hybridization conditions established under which said cross-species hybridization can be effectively performed. As a result, recombinant DNA clones containing DNA sequences encoding the human homologue of murine LIF have been identified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As a result of this construction of LIF-encoding sequences, recombinant DNA molecules have been constructed that use cloned murine or human LIF-encoding DNA sequences to direct the synthesis of clonally pure LIF, either completely or in part, for example in cultured mammalian cells, in yeast or in bacteria. This invention thus extends to substantially pure LIF produced in this manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In one particular embodiment, this invention relates to the expression of the cloned human and murine LIF genes in yeast cells, in fibroblasts and in <highlight><italic>E.coli, </italic></highlight>and to the modification of the cloned gene so that it may be so expressed, as well as to the establishment of the biological and biochemical properties of recombinant human and murine LIF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment also, the present invention relates to recombinant DNA molecules containing nucleotide sequences encoding human or murine LIF (or substantially similar analogues thereof), either completely or in part, in a form in which said nucleotide sequences are able to direct the synthesis and production of human or murine LIF in yeast cells, fibroblasts or <highlight><italic>E.coli, </italic></highlight>either completely or in part. This invention also provides cloning vectors (such as plasmids) and host cells having such recombinant DNA molecules inserted therein. Furthermore, the invention extends to synthetic human or murine LIF, either complete or in part, or substantially similar homologues thereof, produced by expression of such recombinant DNA molecules in yeast cells. In one embodiment of the present work relating to LIF, the human and murine LIF gene sequences have been modified and installed in a yeast expression vector, YEpsecl. Yeast cells have been transformed with the resulting recombinants and the medium conditioned by yeast cells so transformed has been shown to contain a factor with biological properties analogous to those of native human and murine LIF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In view of the potential of LIF for use in the treatment of patients with some forms of myeloid leukaemia and patients with certain infections, the present invention also extends to pharmaceutical compositions comprising LIF, particularly human LIF, either completely or in part, produced for example using cloned LIF-encoding DNA sequences or by chemical synthesis, and to pharmaceutical compositions of analogues of LIF, for example produced by chemical synthesis or derived by mutagenesis of aforesaid cloned LIF-encoding DNA sequences. The pharmaceutical compositions may also contain at least one other biological regulator of blood cells, such as G-CSF or GM-CSF. Furthermore, the invention also extends to diagnostic reagents for use in detecting genetic rearrangements, alterations or lesions associated with the human LIF gene in diseases of blood cell formation, including leukaemia and congenital diseases associated with susceptibility to infection. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Step 1 Krebs II tumour cells (1&times;6<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>) are injected intraperitoneally into C57B16/6fj/WEHI mice and after 7 days the mice are sacrificed and the peritoneal fluid removed. The cells are centrifuged, resuspended at 5&times;1<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cells/ml in Dulbecco&apos;s modified Eagle&apos;s medium containing <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>lipopolysaccharide (200 ng/ml) and incubated for 24 hrs at 37&deg; C. in a humidified incubator containing 10% CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in air. The cells are again centrifuged, the conditioned medium removed, made up to 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide and stored at 4&deg; C. Thirty-six liters of conditioned medium are concentrated to 100 ml using a HIP10-8 hollow fibre cartridge in an Amicon DC2A concentrator, exchanged into 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH8.0 containing 1 mM phenylmethyl sulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), sodium azide (0.02% w/v) and Tween 20 (0.02% v/v) and re-concentrated to 20 ml over a YM-10 membrane in an Amicon stirred cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Step 2. The concentrate is applied to a column (2.5&times;30 cm) of DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted with 200 ml of equilibration buffer followed by a 400 ml linear gradient to 0.3M NaCl in the same buffer. The flow rate is 25 ml/hr and 5.8 ml fractions are collected and assayed. (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Step 3. The fractions of protein which failed to bind to the gel during the pre-gradient step and which contained activity on murine M1 cells are pooled, concentrated over a YM-10 membrane, exchanged into 100 mM sodium acetate buffer pH6.0 containing 1 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 1 mM PMSF, 0.2% sodium azide and 0.02% Tween 20 and applied to a column (1&times;4 cm ) of Lentil lectin-sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column is eluted with 25 ml of equilibration buffer and then a 100 ml linear gradient to 0.5 M &agr;-methyl-D-mannopyranoside in the same buffer at a flow rate of 10 ml/hr. Fractions of 3 ml are collected and assayed. (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Step 4. The fractions of proteins which bind to the gel and are eluted by the sugar and have activity on M1 cells are pooled, concentrated and exchanged into 100 mM sodium acetate buffer pH5.0- containing 1 mM PMSF, 0.02% sodium azide and 0.02% Tween 20 and applied to a column (1.0&times;4.0 cm) of CM-Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column is eluted with 25 ml equilibration buffer and then a 100 ml linear gradient to 1.0 m NaCl in the same buffer and then by 25 ml of 1.0M NaCl adjusted to pH10 with NaOH. The flow rate is 2.0 ml/hr and 3.0 ml fractions are collected. (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Step 5. The fractions of proteins which bind to the gel and are eluted by the NaCl gradient and have activity on M1 cells are pooled, concentrated to 2 ml over a YM-10 membrane and exchanged into 20 mM ammonium acetate buffer pH5.0 containing 0.02% Tween 20 and then filtered through a 0.45&mgr; Millipore filter. The pool is loaded into the injector of a high performance liquid chromatography system (Beckman) equipped with a Waters fatty acid analysis column and dual pumps with gradient programmer. The column is equilibrated in water containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), the sample is injected,. and the column is then eluted with a 5 min linear gradient to 34.8% (v/v) acetonitrile in water and 0.1% TFA and then eluted with a 50 min linear gradient to 49.8% (v/v) acetonitrile in water and 0.1% TFA. The flow rate is 1 ml/min and 1 ml fractions are collected into polypropylene tubes containing 50 &mgr;l of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 0.4% Tween 20. (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The fractions with activity on M1 cells from step 5 consisted of two overlapping ultraviolent-absorbing peaks. Each peak was associated with activity on M1 cells and each peak corresponded to a single protein band of Mr 58,000 on sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gels using silver staining. In each case, the protein band of Mr 58,000 contained the biological activity on M1 cells as assessed by cutting a parallel track on the gel (also loaded with LIF) into M1 strips, extracting the protein from the gel strips and assaying the extracted protein for its ability to suppress proliferation and induce differentiation in M1 cells in semi-solid agar cultures.

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The following Example sets out the steps used in obtaining the N-terminal amino acid sequence and amino acid sequences of various peptides generated by proteolytic cleavage with trypsin or Staphylococcal V8 protease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> LIF purified by the procedure of Example 1 (15 &mgr;g) was applied to a microbore (2 mm) column packed with Brownlee RP300 beads (C8) and eluted on a HPLC system with a linear gradient from 0-60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The protein eluted as a single peak in a volume of 100 &mgr;l. This was applied to a glass fibre disc and allowed to dry and then placed in the sequencing chamber of an Applied Biosystem (Model 470A) gas phase protein sequencer. The protein was sequenced by Edman chemistry and the phenylthiohydantoin derivatives of the individual amino acids identified by HPLC on an Applied Biosystems 120A PTH analyser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A separate aliquot of LIF (20 &mgr;g) also purified by the aforementioned procedure, was diluted to 2 ml in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.2M Tris-HCL buffer pH8.5, 2 mM dithiothreitol and incubated at 37&deg; C. for 2 hrs. Then a 30-fold molar excess of iodoacetic acid was added and the solution incubated at 3&deg; C. for a further 15 min. The solution was applied to the same microbore HPLC column and eluted as described above. The reduced and carboxy-methylated derivative of LIF (RCM-LIF) eluted 3 min later from the column than the untreated LIF and RCM-LIF (200 &mgr;l ) was diluted to 1 ml with 0.1 M Tris-HCL buffer pH8.0 containing 0.02% Tween 20, 1 mM CaCl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 2 &mgr;g of TPCK-treated trypsin. This incubation was allowed to proceed for 18 hr at 37&deg; C. and the mixture was again applied to the microbore column and eluted in the same way as described above. Individual peptides appeared as UV-absorbing peaks, and were collected individually. Some of these peptides were sequenced directly as described above while others were repurified on the same column but using an 0-60% acetonitrile gradient in 0.9% NaCl pH6.0 before being sequenced. </paragraph>

A portion of the amino acid sequence of murine LIF near the N-terminus (residues 15-26, see Example 2) is shown on the top line, the possible combinations of mRNA sequences that could encode this peptide in the middle, and the oligonucleotide probe complementary to this mRNA sequence, below. Note that for all amino acid residues except Cys 17 and His 18, the oligonucleotide is complementary only to the codons most frequently used in mammalian coding regions (Grantham et.al., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>9:43-77, 1981). For Cys 17, the sequence is complementary to both codons. For His 18, the oligonucleotide is complementary to the less frequent CAU codon. It was considered unlikely that the CAC codon would be used as it would generate, in conjunction with the neighbouring Gly codon, the infrequent CpG dinucleotide (Swartz et.al., <highlight><italic>J.

The sequence of the mRNA-synonymous strand of the cDNA is listed 5&prime; to 3&prime; with the predicted amino acid sequence of LIF given above; numbers at the end of lines indicate the position of the final residue (amino acid or nucleotide) on that line. The amino acid sequence is numbered consecutively from the first residue encoded in this clone. Regions of amino acid sequence determined by analysis of the protein are overlined; there are no discordancies between the two. Pro 9 was the N-terminal residue determined by direct amino acid sequence analysis (Example 2). Seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Neuberger, A. et al in <highlight><italic>Glycoproteins, </italic></highlight>Gottschalk, A, ed., Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp 450-490, 1972) are indicated with asterisks and four potential O-linked glycosylation sites (Takahashi, N. et al, <highlight><italic>Proc.

<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Step 1: Preparation of RNA Containing the LIF mRNA </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Cells of the cloned murine T cell line LB3 (Kelso, A. and Metcalf, D. <highlight><italic>Exptl. Hematol. </italic></highlight>13:7-15, 1985) were stimulated with the lectin concanavalin A for 6 hours to enhance the accumulation in the cytoplasm of mRNAs encoding various factors which regulate the growth and differentiation of haemopoietic cells. (Kelso, A., Metcaif, D. and Gough, N. M. <highlight><italic>J. Immunol. </italic></highlight>361:1718-1725, 1986). (For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the increased production of mRNAs encoding the haemopoietic growth factors GM-CSF and Multi-CSF in cells so stimulated). Cytoplasmic RNA was prepared from 5&times;10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>concanavalin A-stimulated LB3 cells using a technique described previously (Gough, N. M. <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>165:683-699, 1983). Polyadenylated mRNA molecules were partitioned from ribosomal RNA by two cycles of chromatography on oligo-dT cellulose using standard procedures (Maniatis, T. et.al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1982). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> It was found subsequently by Northern blot analysis that unlike the mRNAs for GM-CSF and Multi-CSF, the LIF mRNA is present constitutively in LB3 cells and its abundance is not enhanced by concanavalin A stimulation (Gearing D. P. et al. <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>6: 3995-4002, 1987). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Step 2: Synthesis and Cloning of a Library of LB3 cDNA Molecules </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Double-stranded DNA copies of the LB3 mRNA prepared as described above were synthesized by standard procedures (Maniatis, T. et.al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1982 and Gough, N. M. et.al. <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>309:763-767, 1984). Briefly, 10 &mgr;g of cytoplasmic polyadenylated LB3 mRNA were used as a template for synthesis of single-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) in a reaction catalyzed by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and primed with oligo-dT. After completion of this reaction, the mRNA was degraded by incubation at 65&deg; C. for 1 hour in 0.3 M NaOH, 1 mM EDTA. After neutralisation of the base and recovery of the cDNA by ethanol precipitation, the single-stranded cDNA was converted to duplex form in a reaction catalyzed by the Klenow fragment of <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>DNA polymerase I. The &ldquo;hairpin loop&rdquo; structure of the cDNA was then cleaved by treatment with the single-strand specific nuclease S1 and then tails of deoxycytidine residues (approximately 20-30 residues long) were appended to each end of the double-stranded cDNA using the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase as described (Michelson, A. M. and Orkin, S. <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>257:14773-14782, 1982). The dC-tailed cDNA was fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and molecules greater than 500 bp in length recovered and annealed to a plasmid DNA molecule (pJL3, Gough, N. M. et.al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>4:645:653, 1984) that had been cleaved with the restriction endonuclease Sac 1 and to which tails of deoxyguanosine residues had been appended (Michelson, A. M. and Orkin, J., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>257:14773-14782, 1982). The tailed cDNA and plasmid molecules were annealed as described (Gough, N. M. et.al., <highlight><italic>Biochemistry </italic></highlight>19:2702-2710, 1980) and <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>MC1061 (Casadaban, M. and Cohen, S., <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>138:179-207, 1980) transformed with the annealed cDNA/plasmid mixture and approximately 50,000 independently transformed bacterial colonies selected by growth on agar plates containing 10 &mgr;g/ml ampicillin. The transformed bacterial colonies were removed from the agar plates by washing with liquid growth medium containing 50 &mgr;g/ml ampicillin and stored as 10 independent pools in 10% glycerol at &minus;70&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Step 3: Design of Oligonucleotide Probes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A sequence of 26 amino acids at the amino terminus of LIF and residues from 11 different peptides derived by digestion of LIF with trypsin and VB protease have been determined (see Example 2). These amino acid sequences provided the basis for the design of oligonucleotides complementary to certain defined regions of the mRNA encoding LIF for use as hybridization probes to identify cDNA clones corresponding to the LIF mRNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Each naturally occurring amino acid is encoded in its corresponding mRNA by a specific combination of 3 ribonucleoside triphosphates (a codon) (eg Watson, J. <highlight><italic>Molecular Biology of the Gene. </italic></highlight>3rd ed., Benjamin/Cummings, Menlo Park, Calif., 1976). Certain amino acids are specified by only one codon, whereas others are specified by as many as 6 different codons (eg Watson, J. <highlight><italic>Molecular biology of the Gene, </italic></highlight>supra). Since therefore a large number of different combinations of nucleotide sequences could in fact encode any particular amino acid sequence, a large number of different degenerate oligonucleotides would need to be constructed in order to cater for every possible sequence potentially encoding that peptide. There are however, certain technical constraints in the use of highly degenerate oligonucleotides as hybridization probes. However, since for a given amino acid not all codons are employed with equivalent frequency (Grantham, R. et.al. <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>9:43-73, 1981) and since in the mammalian genome the CpG dinucleotide is underrepresented, occurring at only 20-25% of the frequency expected from base composition (Swartz, M. N. et.al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>238:1961-1967, 1962), it is often possible to predict the likely nucleotide sequence encoding a given peptide and thus reduce the complexity of a given oligonucleotide probe. Given the foregoing considerations, a number of oligonucleotides corresponding to different LIF peptides were designed and synthesized by standard procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Step 4: Screening of an LB3 cDNA Library for LIF-encoding Clones </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> For screening colonies of bacteria by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes, 10,000-15,000 bacterial colonies from each pool of the aforementioned LB3 cDNA library were grown on agar plates (containing 50 &mgr;g/ml ampicilin), transferred to nitrocellulose filter disks and plasmid DNA amplified by incubation of the filters on agar plates containing 200 &mgr;g/ml chloramphenicol (Hanahan, D. and Meselson, M. <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>10:63-67, 1980). After regrowth of colonies on the original plate, a second nitrocellulose filter was prepared as above. The master plate was regrown a second time and then stored at 4&deg; C. Plasmid DNA was released from the bacterial colonies and fixed to the nitrocellulose filters as previously described (Maniatis, T. et.al. <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1982). Before hybridization, filters were incubated for several hours at 37&deg; C. in 0.9M NaCl, 0.09 M sodium citrate, 0.2% Ficoll., 0.2% polyvinyl-pyrollidone, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 50 &mgr;g/ml heat denatured salmon sperm DNA, 50 &mgr;g/ml <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>tRNA, 0.1M ATP and 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate. Hybridization was performed in the same solution, containing in addition 0.1% NP40, at 37&deg; C. for 18 hours. 500 ng of the synthetic oligonucleotide shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, was radioactively labelled in a reaction catalyzed by polynucleotide kinase and containing 500 &mgr;Ci of &lsqb;&ggr;-<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb;ATP (specific activity 2,000-3,000 ci/mmol). Unincorporated &lsqb;&ggr;-<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb;ATP was then separated from the radioactively labelled oligonucleotide by ion exchange chromatography on a NACS-PREPAC column (Bethesda Research Laboratories) according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions. The radioactively labelled oligonucleotide was included in the hybridization reaction at a concentration of approx. 20 ng/ml. After hybridization, filters were washed extensively in 0.9M NaCl, 0.09M sodium citrate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate at various temperatures (as described below) and after each wash, autoradiographed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The rationale behind performing successive rounds of washing was that at lower temperatures, all clones having even a small degree of homology with the oligonucleotide (as little as approximately 15 nucleotides) would be revealed as autoradiographic spots appearing on duplicate filters. As the temperature is increased, the oligonucleotide probe would be melted from clones with the lowest level of homology and the corresponding autoradiographic signals would thus be lost. Clones with the highest degree of homology (and thus clones which represent the best candidates for containing LIF cDNA sequences) will retain hybridization at the highest temperature. By this strategy it is thus possible to focus directly on the strongest candidate clones. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the performance of a set of clones on a duplicate pair of filters containing 15,000 LB3 cDNA clones as the washing temperature was raised from 46&deg; C. to 66&deg; C. Several clones retained hybridization to the oligonucleotide only at lower temperatures whereas several retained hybridization even at 66&deg; C. (for example, clones 1 and 2). The latter clones were thus selected for further analysis and the corresponding bacterial colonies removed from the master plates, purified and plasmid DNA prepared from each bacterial clone by standard procedures (Maniatis, T. et.al. <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor, 1982). Preliminary structural analysis of these clones (by assessing the size of the inserted cDNA, by mapping the locations of cleavage sites for various restriction endonucleases and by testing for hybridization with various oligonucleotides corresponding to different LIF peptides) indicated that each of these clones were in fact identical; that is, they represented different isolates of the same original cloning event. Thus further detailed analysis was performed on only one clone, pLIF7.2b. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Step 5: Determination of the Nucleotide Sequence of PLIF7.2b </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA portion of clone pLIF7.2b was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method (Sanger, F. et.al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>74:5463-5467, 1977), using alkaline or heat denatured double-stranded plasmid DNA as template, a variety of oligonucleotides complementary both to the regions of the vector (pJL3) flanking the cDNA and to sequences within the cDNA insert as primers, and using both the Klenow fragment of <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>DNA polymerase I and the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase as polymerases in the sequencing reactions. The sequence so determined for the cDNA portion of clone pLIF7.2b is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Such analysis confirmed that this clone does indeed contain a DNA copy of a mRNA with the capacity to encode the LIF molecule, since within the only translational reading frame that spans the entire cDNA uninterrupted by stop codons, all of the amino acid sequences previously determined for various peptides of the LIF molecule may be found. This clone does not however contain a complete copy of the LIF coding region since (a) it does not extend at the 5&prime; end through a region encoding a presumed hydrophobic leader sequence initiated by a methionine codon and (b) it does not include at its 3&prime; end an in-frame translational stop codon. It does however extend at the 5&prime; end past the start of the region encoding the mature protein, determined by comparison with the previously determined amino-terminal amino acid sequence (residue Pro 9 in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

At the 5&prime; end, the cDNA encodes 8 residues N-terminal to the first residue determined by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis (Pro 9 in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). At the 3&prime; end however, pLIF7.2b is incomplete as it does not contain an in-frame translational stop codon. Inspection of the amino acid sequence of two LIF peptides determined by direct amino acid sequencing (Example 2) suggested that pLIF7.2b was lacking only 27 nucleotides of coding region at the 3&prime; end. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> V8-derived peptide started at residue Ala 162 of the cDNA sequence and extended the amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA clone by 9 residues. A tryptic peptide contained within the V8 peptide terminated at the same residue, suggesting that Phe 187 is the C-terminal residue of the protein. In order to confirm this conclusion, a LIF cDNA clone overlapping with pLIF7.2b and extending 3&prime;-ward was isolated and subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> In order to construct and screen an appropriate cDNA library from which to isolate such a clone, a series of different mRNA samples were screened by Northern blot hybridization to identify the RNA samples with the highest concentration of LIF mRNA molecules. Cytoplasmic polyadenylated RNA, prepared essentially as described previously (Gough, N. M. <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>165: 683-699, 1983), was fractionated on 1% agarose gels containing 20 mM morpholinopropane sulfonic acid (MOPS), 5 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.0), plus 6% v/v formaldehyde, filters containing RNA were soaked in 2&times;SSC, containing 0.2% Ficoll, 0.2% polyvinyl-pyrollidone, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM ATP, 50 &mgr;g/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and 50 &mgr;g/ml <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>tRNA, at 67&deg; C. for several hours. Hybridization was in the same buffer plus 0.1% SDS at 67&deg; C. The probe used to detect LIF transcripts consisted of an approx. 750 bp Eco RI-Hind III fragment containing the cDNA insert of pLIF7.2b subcloned in pSP65. This fragment contains not only the cDNA sequence but also G-C tails and approx. 150 bp of pJL3 vector sequence. Riboprobes of approx. 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>9 </superscript></highlight>cpm/&mgr;g were derived by transcription of this SP6 subclone using reagents supplied by BRESA (Adelaide). The probe was included in hybridization at approx. 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>cpm/ml. Filters were washed extensively in 2&times;SSC, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS at 67&deg; C. and finally in 0.2&times;SSC at 67&deg; C. prior to autoradiography. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Such analysis revealed that LIF transcripts were present at low levels in a wide variety of haemopoietic cell lines and that there was considerable variation in the level of LIF mRNA in different batches of Krebs RNA. Two batches of Krebs ascites tumour cell RNA were selected for synthesis of two cDNA libraries. cDNA libraries were constructed using the reagents supplied by Amersham (Product numbers RPN.1256 and RPN.1257) and using the manufacturer&apos;s instructions; the cloning vector was &lgr;GT10. Approximately 4&times;10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>recombinant clones were obtained and screened by hybridization with an oligonucleotide corresponding to a sequence of 36 residues at the 3&prime; end of the pLIF7.2b sequence: nucleotides 500-535 (inclusive) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Phage plaques representing the Krebs cDNA library were grown at a density of approx. 50,000 plaques per 10 cm petri dish, transferred in duplicate to nitrocellulose and treated using standard techniques (Maniatis, T. et al, <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor, 1982). Prior to hybridization, filters were incubated for several hours at 37&deg; C. in 6&times;SSC (SSC&equals;0.15M NaCl, 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% Ficoll, 0.2% polyvinyl-pyrollidone, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM ATPD 50 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and 50 &mgr;/ml <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>tRNA. Hybridization was in the same solution containing 0.1% NP40, at 37&deg; C. for 16-18 hours. The aforementioned oligonucleotide probe, radioactively labelled using &lsqb;&ggr;-<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb; ATP and polynucleotide kinase to a specific activity of approx. 10<highlight><superscript>9 </superscript></highlight>cpm&mgr;pg and separated from unincorporated label by ion exchange chromatography on a NACS column (Bethesda Research Laboratories), was included in the hybridization at a concentration of approx. 20 ng/ml. After hybridization, filters were extensively washed in 6&times;SSC, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate at 60&deg; C. One plaque representing clone &lgr;LIFNK1, positive on duplicate filters, was picked and rescreened at lower density, as before. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The cDNA insert of approx. 950 bp in &lgr;LIFNK1, which hybridized with the aforementioned oligonucleotide, was subcloned into a plasmid vector (pEMBL8&plus;, Dente, L. et al, <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acids Res. </italic></highlight>11: 1645-1655, 1983) to generate clone pLIFNK1. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA insert in pLIFNK1 was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method (Sanger, F. et al, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>74: 5463-5467, 1977) using alkaline denatured double-stranded plasmid DNA as template (Chen, E. Y. and Seeburg, P. H., <highlight><italic>DNA </italic></highlight>4: 165-170, 1985), a variety of oligonucleotides complementary both to regions of the vector flanking the cDNA and to sequences within the cDNA insert as primers, and using both the Klenow fragment of <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>DNA polymerase and AMV reverse transcriptase as polymerases in the sequencing reactions. The nucleotide sequence of a portion of the cDNA insert in pLIFNK1 is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The amino acid sequence specified by pLIFNK1 is identical at the C-terminus with the 9 amino acids predicted by direct amino acid sequencing to constitute the C-terminus of LIF, and confirms that Phe 187 is the C-terminal residue of LIF, since in the pLIFNK1 cDNA sequence the codon for this residue is immediately followed by an in-frame translational stop codon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Step 2: Construction of a LIF Codon Region in a Yeast Expression Vector </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Initial production of the protein encoded by the LIF cDNA clones was achieved in a eukaryotic system (yeast), so that the expressed product would be glycosylated, secreted and correctly folded. The expression vector used, YEpsec1 (Baldari, C. et al, <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>6: 229-234, 1987), provides an N-terminal leader sequence derived from the killer toxin gene of <highlight><italic>Kluyveromyces lactis, </italic></highlight>shown previously to direct the efficient secretion of interleukin 1 (Baldari, C. et al, <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>6: 229-234, 1987), transcribed from a galactose-inducible hybrid GAL-CYC promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In order to express the protein encoded by pLIF7.2b in this vector, it was necessary to modify the cDNA in several ways (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). At the 5&prime; end it was necessary not only to remove the few nucleotides specifying the partial mammalian leader sequence, but also to include an appropriate restriction endonuclease cleavage site (Bam HI) to allow insertion in-frame with the <highlight><italic>K. lactis </italic></highlight>leader and retain an appropriate signal peptidase cleavage site (Gly-Ser). At the 3&prime; end, two versions of the coding region for LIF were constructed. One version (LIFmut1) was constructed so that a stop codon immediately followed the last codon of pLIF7.2b (Gln 178). The other version (LIFmut2) was constructed to append a sequence encoding the 9 amino acid residues known to be missing from PLIF7.2b (see above), followed by an in-frame translational stop codon. An appropriate restriction endonuclease cleavage site (Hind III) completed both constructs. All of these modifications were achieved by oligonucleotide- mediated mutagenesis: The approx.750 bp Eco RI-Hind III fragment carrying the 535 bp cDNA insert of pLIF7.2b, bounded by G-C tails and a portion of the pJL3 vector was subcloned into plasmid pEMBL8&plus; (Dente, L. et al, <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acids Res. </italic></highlight>11: 1645-1655, 1983) and single-stranded DNA was prepared as described (Cesarini, G. and Murray, J. A. H. in Setlow, J. K. and Hollaender, A. (eds), <highlight><italic>Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods. </italic></highlight>Plenum Press, New York, Vol. 8, 1987 (in press)). In vitro mutagenesis was performed as described (Nisbet, I. T. and Beilharz, M. W. <highlight><italic>Gene Anal. Techn. </italic></highlight>2: 23-29, 1985), using oligonucleotides of 35, 51 and 61 bases respectively, to modify the 5&prime; end and the 3&prime; end of the cDNA as outline above. Bam HI-Hind III fragments containing the modified LIF cDNA sequences were ligated into plasmid YEpsec1 and the nucleotide sequence of the inserts in the resulting recombinants was determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Step 3: Introduction of the YEpsec1/LIF Recombinants into Yeast Cells </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>S. cerevisiae </italic></highlight>strain GY41 (leu2. ura3 adel his4 met2 trp5 gall cir&plus;; &times;4003-5b from Yeast Genetic Stock Centre, Berkeley) was transformed by the polyethylene glycol method (Klebe, R. J. et al, <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>25: 333-341, 1983). Transformants were selected and maintained on synthetic minimal medium (2% carbon source, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco) supplemented with 50&mgr;g/ml of the required amino acids) under uracil deprivation. Expression of insert sequences in plasmid YEpsec1 was achieved by growing transformants in either non-selective complete medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) or in synthetic minimal medium, each containing 2% galactose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Step 4: Determination of the Biological Properties of Yeast-derived LIF </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Assays for differentiation-inducing activity and leukaemia-suppressive activity of yeast conditioned medium were performed in 1 ml cultures containing 300 M1 cells (provided by Dr. M. Hozumi, Saitama Cancer Research Centre, Japan) in Dulbecco&apos;s Modified Eagle&apos;s Medium with a final concentration of 20% foetal calf serum and 0.3% agar. Material to be assayed was added in serially diluted 0.1 ml volumes to the culture dish prior to the addition of the cell suspension in agar medium. Cultures were incubated for 7 days in a fully humidified atmosphere at 10% CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Cultures were scored using a dissection microscope at &times;35 magnification, scoring as differentiated any colonies with a corona of dispersed cells or composed wholly of dispersed cells. Morphological examination of colonies was performed by fixing the entire culture with 1 ml 2.5% glutaraldehyde then staining the dried cultures on microscope slides using acetylcholinesterase/Luxol Fast Blue/Haematoxylin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Assays for colony stimulating activity were performed using 75,000 C57BL bone marrow cells as described previously (Metcalf, D. <highlight><italic>The Hemopoietic Colony Stimulating Factors </italic></highlight>Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1984). Assays for differentiation inducing activity on WEHI-3B D<highlight><superscript>30 </superscript></highlight> cells were performed as described previously (Nicola, N. et al, <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>258: 9017-9023, 1983). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Medium from cultures of yeast containing the full-length coding region (LIFmut2), but not from cultures of non-transformed yeast, yeast containing the vector YEpsec1alone, or yeast containing the incomplete coding region (LIFmut1), was able to induce typical macrophage differentiation in cultures of M1 colonies (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</cross-reference>). As with purified native LIF, with increasing concentrations the yeast-derived material also progressively reduced the number and size of M1 colonies developing (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</cross-reference>). Comparison with purified native LIF indicated that the yeast conditioned medium contained up to 16,000 Units/ml (approximately 130 ng/ml) of LIF. Yeast-derived LIF, like purified native LIF-A, failed to stimulate colony formation by normal granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells or to induce differentiation in, or suppress proliferation, of WEHI-3B D<highlight><superscript>30 </superscript></highlight> leukaemic colonies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Size fractionation on a Sephacryl S-200 column, indicated that yeast-derived LIF co-eluted with proteins of apparent molecular weight 67,000 to 150,000 Daltons, compared with 58,000 Daltons for LIF derived from Krebs cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The absence of LIF activity in medium conditioned by yeast containing an incomplete coding region (LIFmut1) suggests that the nine hydrophobic C-terminal residues missing from this construct might be required for LIF function. Whilst these residues might interact with the receptor, they may also constitute part of a hydrophobic core within the protein, and thus their absence may prevent proper folding. Alternatively they might in some way be required for efficient secretion of LIF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Step 5: Receptor Binding Specificity of Yeast-derived Murine LIF and Purified Native LIF-A from Krebs II Ascites Cell Conditioned Medium </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Purified murine LIF-A (Example 1) was iodinated as disclosed previously (Example 3). Peritoneal cells were harvested by lavage from mice in which a high level of macrophages had been induced in the peritoneal cavity with thioglycollate. These cells were washed and resuspended at 2.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>/50&mgr;l in Hepes-buffered RPMI medium containing 10% foetal calf serum. Cells in 50 &mgr;l aliquots were incubated with 200,000 cpm of <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I-LIF-A (10 &mgr;l in the same medium) and 10 &mgr;l of control medium or serial two-fold dilutions of unlabelled pure murine LIF-A or yeast-derived murine LIF. At appropriate concentrations, supernatant from galactose-induced yeast containing the LIFmut2 construct (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) competed for binding of <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I-LIF-A to its receptors on peritoneal cells while uninduced yeast supernatant did not (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>). The degree of competition was equal to that of authentic native LIF-A, indicating that the yeast-derived LIF-A contained all the information required for binding to LIF-A cellular receptors. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The following example sets out the steps used to express recombinant murine LIF in mammalian cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The accompanying <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> relates to step 1 of the method described below: The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA portion of clone pLIFNK3. The nucleotide sequence of the mRNA-synonymous strand is presented in the 5&prime; to 3&prime; orientation with the inferred amino acid sequence of LIF given above. The N-terminal amino acid residue previously determined is indicated as &plus;1. The Eco R1 site at the 5&prime; end of the cDNA and the Xba I site spanning the stop codon (used in inserting the LIF coding region into pMP-Zen in step 2) are indicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Step 1: Determination of the Amino Acid Sequence of the N-terminal Leader Sequence of Murine LIF </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The cDNA clones pLIF7.2b and pLIFNK1 (see above) contain incomplete copies of the LIF mRNA. Although they contain, together, the complete coding region for the mature portion of the LIF protein, they do not contain the complete hydrophobic leader sequence, required for secretion of LIF from mammalian cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> In order to isolate a cDNA clone containing the region encoding the hydrophobic leader, a further 10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cDNA clones constructed as above (Example 5), using the same batch of Krebs mRNA as a template, were screened (as above) using as probes two oligonucleotides corresponding to a sequence of 35 residues at the 5&prime; end and 36 residues at the 3&prime; end of the pLIF7.2b sequence (nucleotides 67-102 and 500-535, inclusive, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Two plaques representing clones &lgr;LIFNK2 and &lgr;LIFNK3, positive on duplicate filters were picked and rescreened at lower density, as previously. Since &lgr;LIFNK3 was shown to hybridize with each of the two oligonucleotides used, it was selected for further analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The cDNA insert of approx. 1400 bp in &lgr;LIFNK3 was subcloned into the plasmid vector pEMBL 8<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> (Dente, L., et.al., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>11:1645-1655, 1983) to generate clone pLIFNK3. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA insert of pLIFNK3 was performed as for pLIF7.2b and pLIFNK1 (above). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA insert in pLIFNK3 is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, and indicates that pLIFNK3 contains a complete LIF coding region: there is an initiation codon (AUG) at position 23-25 in the pLIFNK3 sequence, preceding a sequence encoding a typical hydrophobic leader sequence of 24 amino acid residues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> The coding region extends to the same translational stop codon as defined previously by pLIFNK1 (above). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Step 2: Introduction of a LIF Coding Region into a Mammalian Expression Vector </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The mammalian expression vector chosen initially was the retroviral expression vector pMP-Zen. The vector is derived from the Moloney murine leukaemia virus-based vector pZIPNeo SV(X) (Cepko, C. L. et.al., <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>37:1053-1062, 1984) by deletion of the neo<highlight><superscript>R </superscript></highlight>gene together with nearby SV40 and plasmid sequences, leaving an Xho I expression site. The 3&prime; region of the vector is also modified to incorporate the enhancer from the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV) (Bowtel, D. D. L. et. al., <highlight><italic>Mol. Biol. Med. </italic></highlight>4:229-250, 1987). This vector was chosen, firstly since the LIF/PMP-Zen recombinant may be packaged into helper-free infectious retroviral particles by passage through &psgr;2 cells (Mann, R., et.al. <highlight><italic>Cell, </italic></highlight>33:153-159, 1983). Such viral particles may then be used to efficiently introduce (by infection) the LIF/pMP-Zen recombinant into a wide variety of murine cell types (Mann, R. et.al. <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>33:153-159, 1983). Secondly, this particular vector, which employs the MPSV LTRs for expression of the foreign coding region, has been shown to direct the efficient expression of certain other haemopoietic growth and differentiation factors including GM-CSF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The segment of pLIFNK3 chosen for insertion into pMP-Zen extended from position 1 (an Eco R1 site) to position 630 (an Xba 1 site spanning the stop codon)&mdash;see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. This segment was chosen since it contains little more than the coding region of pre-LIF and excludes all of the 3&prime; untranslated region, which may contain sequences conferring mRNA instability (e.g. Shaw, G. and Kamen, R. <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>46:659-667, 1986; Verma, I. M. and Sassone-Corsi, P., <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>51 : 513-514, 1987 ). In order to insert this segment into pMP-Zen, it was first inserted between the Eco R1 and Xba I sites of pIC20H (Marsh, J. L. et.al. <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>32: 481-485, 1984) by standard techniques (Maniatis et.al., 1982, supra). The cDNA insert was then recovered from the polylinker of the pIC20H plasmid by Sal I plus Xho I digestion, thus generating a LIF cDNA fragment with cohesive ends appropriate for inserting into the Xho I cloning site of pMP-Zen. The insertion of the LIf cDNA fragment into pMP-Zen was achieved by standard techniques (Maniatis et.al., 1982, supra). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Step 3: Introduction of the pMP-Zen/LIF Recombinant into Murine Fibroblasts </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> pMP-Zen/LIF DNA was introduced into &psgr;2 fibroblasts by electroporation (Potter et.al., <highlight><italic>PNAS </italic></highlight>81:7161-7165, 1984). 30 &mgr;g pMP-Zen/LIF DNA plus 3 &mgr;g pSV2Neo DNA (Southern, P. J. and Berg, P. <highlight><italic>J. Mol. App. Genet. </italic></highlight>1:327-341, 1982) were mixed with 1&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>&psgr;2 fibroblasts in 1 ml of DME/10% FCS (Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium containing 10% foetal calf serum) and subjected to a pulse of 500 v at a capacitance of 25 &mgr;F (using a BioRad Gene-Pulser model No. 1652078). Transfectants were initially selected on the basis of resistance to the antibiotic G418 conferred by the pSV2Neo DNA. G418-resistant &psgr;2 cells were selected in 400 &mgr;g/ml G418 by standard procedures (Mann, R. et al, <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>33: 153-159, 1983). Of 19 G418-resistant clones examined, 2 also contained the pMP-Zen/LIF construct as assessed by LIF activity detectable in &psgr;2 conditioned media. </paragraph>

These clones should therefore be applicable to the infection of normal murine haemopoietic progenitor cells which can be used to reconstitute the haemopoietic system of irradiated mice in order to study the effects of high level expression of native LIF on normal murine haemopoiesis, in a manner analogous to that used for Zen/GM-CSF viral infection. </paragraph>

The C-terminus of the glutathione S-transferase, the thrombin cleavage site and the N-terminus of the murine LIF portions of the tripartite fusion protein, along with the nucleotide sequence encoding this amino acid sequence, are shown. The expected site of cleavage by thrombin is indicated by an arrow. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The expression vector used for expressing LIF in <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>was pGEX-2T (Smith, D. B. and Johnson, K. S., <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>(in press), 1988), which directs the synthesis of foreign polypeptides as fusions with the C-terminus of Sj26, a 26 kD glutathione S-transferase (E.C. 2.5.1.18) encoded by the parasitic helminth <highlight><italic>Schistosoma japonicum. </italic></highlight>In the majority of cases, fusion proteins have been shown to be soluble in aqueous solutions and can be purified from crude bacterial lysates under non-denaturing conditions by affinity chromatography on immobilized glutathione. The particular vector pGEX-2T has been engineered so that the glutathione S-transferase carrier can be cleaved from the fusion protein by digestion with the site-specific protease thrombin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The complete coding region of murine LIF, derived from plasmid pLIFmut2 (see Example 5 and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> above) was introduced as a Bam HI-Eco R1 fragment into the multiple cloning site of pGEX-2T (Smith, D. B. and Johnson, K. S., supra), thus positioning the LIF coding region 3&prime; of, and in the same translational reading frame as, that of the glutathione S-transferase and the thrombin cleavage site. Thus the LIF protein would be located C-terminal to these elements in a tripartite glutathione S-transferase/thrombin cleavage site/LIF fusion protein (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). Note that the position of the thrombin cleavage site is such that two amino acid residues (Gly-Ser) will be appended to the N-terminus of the LIF protein after thrombin cleavage. The construction of the aforementioned plasmid, pGEX-2T/LIF, was achieved by standard techniques, and the plasmid was introduced into <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>NM522 (Gough, J.

<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In order to induce the expression of the glutathione S-transferase/LIF fusion protein, 10 ml cultures of <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>NM522 cells containing pGEX-2T/LIF were grown to logarithmic phase in Luria broth, and isopropyl &bgr;-D-thiogalactopyranoside added to a concentration of 0.1 mM. After a further 4 hours growth, during which time the glutathione S-transferase/LIF gene is expressed, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml mouse tonicity phosphate-buffered saline (MTPBS: 150 NaCl, 16 mM Na<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>HPO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, 4 mM NaH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, pH7.3). Cells were lysed on ice by mild sonication and after adding Triton X-100 to 1%, cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10,000 g, 5 min, 4&deg; C.). The clarified supernatant was mixed at room temperature in a 50 ml polypropylene tube on a rotating platform with 200 &mgr;l 50% glutathione-agarose beads (sulphur linkage, Sigma). (Before use, beads were pre-swollen in MTPBS, washed twice in the same buffer and stored in MTPBS at 4&deg; C. as a 50% solution v/v). After absorption (5 min.), beads were collected by centrifugation (500 g, 1 min) and washed three times in MTPBS/Triton X-100. The glutathione S-transferase/LIF fusion protein was then eluted by competition with free glutathione: beads were incubated with 100 &mgr;l 50 mM Tris. HCl, 5 mM reduced glutathione (pH 7.5) for 2 min at room temperature and the beads removed by centrifugation. The elution step was performed twice, and the two 100 &mgr;l aliquots of eluate pooled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> 100 &mgr;l of the glutathione S-transferase/LIF fusion protein was treated with thrombin as described (Smith, D. B. and Johnson, K. S., supra). </paragraph>

After staining with Coomassie Blue, a single major protein species of relative molecular weight &tilde;46 kDa was revealed in the uncleaved preparation, and in the thrombin-cleaved preparation two major bands of &tilde;26 kDa and &tilde;20 kDa (corresponding to the expected sizes of the fusion protein (46 kDa), the glutathione S-transferase (26 kDa) and the LIF proteins (20 kDa) respectively). By estimating the mass of the Coomassie-stained bands on this gel, the yield of glutathione S-transferase/LIF protein from the original 10 ml <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>culture was estimated to be &tilde;1.5 &mgr;g. </paragraph>

In the left hand panel, hybridization was at 65&deg; C. in 2&times;SSC, and final washing at 65&deg; C. in 0.2&times;SSC. In the right hand panel, hybridization and washing were both in 6&times;SSC at 65&deg; C. In the left hand panel, linear pLIF7.2b plasmid DNA (5.6 kb) was included at an amount equivalent to 10 and 1 copies per haploid mouse genome (400 pg and 40 pg respectively) assuming a molecular weight for the haploid mouse genome of 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>9 </superscript></highlight>bp (Laird, C.

<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Step 1: Determination of the Number of LIF-related Genes in the Murine Genome </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> In view of the data (Example 1) that medium conditioned by Krebs II cells contains two biochemically separable but functionally similar factors capable of inducing the differentiation of M1 cells (LIF-A and LIF-B) we wished to determine how many genes there are in the murine genome related to the species we have purified and cloned. Southern blots of murine genomic DNA digested with various restriction endonucleases were therefore hybridized with a probe derived from pLIF7.2b tinder conditions of both high and low stringency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> 20 &mgr;g aliquots of high molecular weight genomic DNA from BALB/c mouse livers were digested to completion with various restriction endonucleases, fractionated by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Prior to hybridization, filters were incubated for several hours at 65&deg; C. in either 6&times;SSC (low stringency) or 2&times;SSC (high stringency) (SSC&equals;0.15M NaCl, 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% Ficoll, 0.2% polyvinyl-pyrollidone, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM ATP, 50 &mgr;g/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and 50 &mgr;g/ml <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>tRNA. Hybridization was in the same solution containing 0.1% SDS, at 65&deg; C. for 16-18 hours. Filters were then washed in either 6&times;SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65&deg; C. (low stringency) or in 2&times;SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65&deg; C., followed by 0.2&times;SSC, 65&deg; C. (high stringency) as detailed in the legend to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. The hybridization probe used was as previously disclosed the approx. 750 bp Eco RI-Hind III fragment spanning the cDNA insert of pLIF7.2b radiolabelled to a specific activity of approx. 4&times;10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>cpm/&mgr;g by nick-translation and included in the hybridization at a concentration of approx. 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>cpm/ml. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> In mouse liver DNA (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>) as well as in DNA from Krebs II cells, LB3 T cells and WEHI265 monocytic cells (not shown) the LIF probe detected unique Eco RI, Bam HI, and Hind III fragments of approximately 11, 3 and 13 kbp respectively. The same pattern of hybridization was evident at both high (0.2&times;SSC, 65&deg; C.) and low stringency (6&times;SSC, 65&deg; C.) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>); under low stringency hybridization and washing conditions no additional bands were evident. Similarly, unique hybridizing fragments were also detected in Pst I, Stu I, Sac I, Eco R5 and Bg1 II-digested genomic DNA (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>). Moreover, in the experiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, pLIF7.2b plasmid DNA was included at a concentration equivalent to 10 and 1 copies per haploid mouse genome (tracks 1 and 2); the hybridization intensity of the genomic LIF sequences was not significantly different from the intensity of the unique gene standard (track 2). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> Taken together, the foregoing data indicate that the LIF gene is unique in the murine genome, with no close relatives. Thus the two species of LIF are not likely to be products of different genes, but rather are more likely to represent post- transcriptional or post-translational variants of the same gene product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Step 2: Derivation of a Restriction Endonuclease Cleavage Map of the Murine LIF Gene </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> In order to determine the disposition of restriction endonuclease cleavage sites in and around the murine LIF gene, and thus provide a molecular fingerprint of this gene, DNA from mouse livers or from Krebs ascites tumour cells was digested with various restriction endonucleases and subjected to Southern blot analysis as described in Step 1 (under high stringency hybridization and washing conditions). Examples of such experiments are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>. Analysis of the size of the digestion products enables one to generate a map of the location of each cleavage site around the LIF gene (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Step 3: Chromosome Assignment of the Murine LIF Gene </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> To determine the chromosome on which the mouse LIF gene is located, DNA was examined from six mouse-Chinese hamster ovary somatic cell hybrid cell lines which retain various mouse chromosomes (Cory, S. et al, <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>2: 213-216, 1983; Francke, U. et al, <highlight><italic>Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. </italic></highlight>19: 57-84, 1977). Southern blot analysis performed as described in Step 1 (using high stringency hybridization and washing conditions) indicated that the 3 kbp Bam HI fragment containing the murine LIF gene was absent from all of the hybrids (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>). Since chromosome 11 is the only mouse chromosome not retained in any of these lines (Cory, S. et al, <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>2: 213-216, 1983), a characteristic of mouse-Chinese hamster hybrids (Francke, U. et al, <highlight><italic>Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. </italic></highlight>19: 57- 84, 1977), it is likely that the LIF gene is on this chromosome. On the same basis, the murine GM-CSF gene (Barlow, D. P. et al, <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>6: 617-623, 1987) and Multi-CSF gene (Ihle, J. N. and Kozak, C. A., <highlight><italic>National Cancer Institute. Frederick Cancer Research Facility, Annual Report, </italic></highlight>1984) have also been assigned to chromosome 11, an assignment confirmed by genetic linkage studies (Barlow, D. P. et al, <highlight><italic>EMBO J. </italic></highlight>6: 617-623, 1987). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> 200 ng of pLIF7.2 cDNA fragment thus purified was radioactively labelled to a specific activity of approximately 3&times;10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>cpm/&mgr;g by nick-translation (Rigby, P.

<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> A method has been previously disclosed for using a radioactively labelled fragment of the mouse LIF cDNA clone pLIF7.2b as a hybridization probe to detect the human LIF gene. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> demonstrates that this method allows the human LIF gene to be detected in human genomic DNA digested with a variety of restriction endonucleases. Analyses such as this, and other gels not shown, revealed the sizes of DNA fragments generated by a variety of restriction endonucleases on which the human LIF gene is located. Such data is of importance in subsequent steps of this example, not only to establish conditions under which the mouse probe can be used as a hybridization probe to detect the human, but also to provide diagnostic restriction mapping data to aid in identifying human genomic LIF clones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> A high degree of homology between the mouse and human LIF sequences was apparent when mouse and human genomic DNA digested with Bam HI was hybridized with a mouse LIF cDNA probe under a variety of conditions of hybridization and washing (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference>). As the stringency of hybridization and washing was raised, so the background smear was reduced, revealing a unique fragment of &tilde;3 kbp hybridizing with the mouse probe. Significantly, the human gene retained substantial hybridization even at 65&deg; C. in 0.2&times;SSC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Step 2: Screening of a Human Genomic Library and Isolation of a Clone Containing the LIF Gene </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> A library of human genomic DNA, partially digested with Sau 3A and ligated into the lambda phage cloning vector EMBL3A, was screened for LIF gene-containing clones by hybridization with the mouse cDNA as a probe. The fragment of LIF cDNA was radioactively labelled and the conditions of hybridization were as disclosed previously (Example 4). Briefly, phage plaques representing the genomic library were grown at a density of &tilde;50,000 plaques per 10 cm petri dish and transferred to nitrocellulose as described (Maniatis, T. et al, <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor, 1982). Prior to hybridization, filters were incubated for several hours at 65&deg; C. in 6&times;SSC (SSC&equals;0.15M NaCl, 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% Ficoll, 0.2% polyvinyl-pyrollidone, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM ATP, 50 &mgr;g/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and 50 &mgr;g/ml <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>tRNA. Hybridization as in the same solution containing 0.1% SDS, at 65&deg; C. for 16-18 hours. The LIF cDNA fragment, radioactively labelled by nick-translation using &lsqb;&agr;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb; dATP to a specific activity of &tilde;2&times;10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>cpm/&mgr;g was included in the hybridization at a concentration of &tilde;2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>cpm/ml. After hybridization, filters were extensively washed in 6&times;SSC, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate at 65&deg; C. and then autoradiographed. Plaques positive on duplicate filters were picked and rescreened at lower density, as before. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Three clones were thus identified and purified: &lgr;HGLIF1, 2 and 3. In order to determine the relationship between these clones and to determine which, if any, contain the human LIF gene, DNA was prepared from each clone and digested with these restriction endonucleases: Sal I which liberates the entire segment of cloned genomic DNA and Bam HI and Pst I which cleave in and around the LIF gene to generate characteristic fragments of &tilde;3 kbp and 1.8 kbp and 0.6 kbp respectively (as determined above). After digestion of the recombinant phage DNAs and resolution by electro-phoresis on agarose gels (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, left hand panel), the DNA was transferred to nitrocellulose and hybridized with the mouse LIF cDNA probe (under the conditions outlined above) to reveal the fragments containing the LIF gene (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, right hand panel). This analysis revealed that </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> (a) all three clones appeared to be identical; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> (b) all contain an &tilde;9 kbp segment of genomic DNA containing a region homologous with the mouse LIF probe; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> (c) the region of homology with the mouse cDNA is present on a 3 kbp Bam HI fragment and on 1.8 and 0.6 kbp Pst I fragments, characteristics of the human LIF gene (see above). Thus it was concluded that all three clones contain a segment of chromosomal DNA encompassing the human LIF gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Step 3: Determination of the Nucleotide Sequence of the Human LIF Gene </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> The &tilde;3 kbp Bam HI fragment of &lgr;HGLIF1 shown above to hybridize with the mouse LIF cDNA probe was recloned into the plasmid vector pEMBL8<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, giving rise to clone pHGLIFBaml, and subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. Nucleotide sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method (Sanger, F et al, <highlight><italic>Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. </italic></highlight>74: 5463-5467, 1977) using alkaline denatured double-stranded plasmid DNA as template, a variety of oligonucleotides complementary to sequences within the gene as primers, and using both the Klenow fragment of <highlight><italic>E.coli </italic></highlight>DNA polymerase I and the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase as polymerases in the sequencing reactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> The entire nucleotide sequence of the Bam HI fragment spanning the LIF gene (2840 bp) was determined, of which 1297 bp is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>. Alignment of this sequence with the murine LIF mRNA sequence revealed that the sequences encoding the mature human LIF protein are present on two exons separated by an intron of 693 bp (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>). For the region encoding the mature protein there is a high degree of homology between the two species at both the nucleotide and the amino acid sequence level. Within exon 1 there is 88% nucleic acid sequence homology (114/129 residues compared) and 91% amino acid sequence homology (39/43) for the region encoding the mature protein (position 58-186). Exon 2 is somewhat less homologous, 77% at the nucleotide level (318/411) and 74% at the amino acid level (101/136) within the coding region. Considering the mature protein as a whole, mouse and human LIF sequences determined here are identical at 140 of 179 positions (78%) with no insertions or deletions (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>). Moreover, many of the differences are highly conservative substitutions (Lys:Arg, Glu:Asp and Leu:Val:Ala). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> 5&prime; of the codon for the N-terminal proline residue of mature LIF, (position 58 in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference>) the human gene is homologous with the murine LIF mRNA sequence through a region encoding most of the hydrophobic leader. However, the entire leader is not encoded on this exon, since the mRNA and gene sequences diverge at a typical RNA splice site (TCCCCAG) (Mount, S. M., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>10:459-472, 1982). The exon specifying the 5&prime; untranslated region and the first residues of the leader is not present within 1097 bp 5&prime; of this splice site. In the mouse LIF gene, the exon specifying the first 6 amino acid residues of the hydrophobic leader is located &tilde;1.5 kbp 5&prime; of the analogous splice site. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> In order to determine the disposition of the restriction endonuclease cleavage sites in and around the human LIF gene, and thus provide a molecular fingerprint of this gene, human genomic DNA (from the RAMOS cell line) was digested with various restriction endonucleases singly and in pair-wise combinations and subject to Southern blot analysis as described in Example 8, except that the probe used was the 3 kbp Bam HI fragment derived from pHGLIFBam1 described in Step 3 above and radio-labelled by nick-translation. Analysis of the data so-derived (not shown), as well as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> and derived from analysis of &lgr;HGLIF1 and pHGLIFBam1, gave rise to the restriction endonuclease cleavage map shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> In order to express the protein encoded by the human LIF gene in this vector it was necessary to modify the gene in several ways. At the 5&prime; end of the region encoding the mature protein a cleavage site for the restriction endonuclease Bam HI was introduced to allow insertion in frame with the <highlight><italic>K. lactis </italic></highlight>leader and retain an appropriate signal peptidase cleavage site (Gly-Ser). The same modification as previously applied to the mouse cDNA (pLIF7.2b) was made here. In the middle, the 693 bp intervening sequence was removed, fusing the two exons in the same translational reading frame. At the 3&prime; end, a second translational stop codon was introduced immediately 3&prime; of the natural stop codon, followed by a Hind III site for insertion into YEpsecl. All of the modifications were achieved by oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis: the &tilde;3 kbp Bam HI fragment spanning the LIF gene was subcloned into the plasmid pEMBL8<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, (Dente, L. et al, <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>11:1645-1655, 1983) and single-stranded DNA prepared by F1 superinfection.

Transformants were selected and maintained on synthetic minimal medium (2% carbon source, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco) supplemented with 50 &mgr;g/ml of the required amino acids) under uracil deprivation.

<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> In view of the high degree of sequence similarity between mouse and human LIF, the activity of yeast derived human LIF on murine M1 cells was assessed. Assays for differentiation-inducing activity and leukaemia-suppressive activity of yeast conditioned medium were performed in 1 ml cultures containing 300 murine M1 cells (provided by Dr M. Hozumi, Saitama Cancer Research Centre, Japan) in Dulbecco&apos;s Modified Eagle&apos;s medium with a final concentration of 20% foetal calf serum and 0.3% agar. Material to be assayed was added in serially diluted 0.1 ml volumes to the culture dish prior to the addition of the cell suspension in agar medium. Cultures were incubated for 7 days in a fully humidified atmosphere of 10% CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>in air. Cultures were scored using a dissection microscope at &times;35 magnification, scoring as differentiated any colonies with a corona of dispersed cells or composed wholly of dispersed cells. Morphological examination of colonies was performed by fixing the entire culture with 1 ml 2.5% glutaraldehyde then staining the dried cultures on microscope slides using acetylcholinesterase/Luxol Fast Blue/Haematoxylin. </paragraph>

As with murine LIF, with increasing concentrations the yeast-derived human material also progressively reduced the number and size of M1 colonies developing. Comparison with purified native murine LIF indicated that the yeast conditioned medium contained up to 50,000 Units/ml of human LIF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> Step 4: Receptor Binding Specificity of Yeast-derived Human LIF </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> Purified murine LIF-A (Example 1) was iodinated as disclosed previously. M1 cells were washed and resuspended at 2.5&times;10<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>/50 &mgr;l in Hepes-buffered RPMI medium containing 10% foetal calf serum.

<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> Medium conditioned by galactose-induced yeast cells containing the YEpsec1/HLIF recombinant was able to compete for the binding of native murine <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I-LIF-A to specific cellular receptors on murine M1 cells to the same extent as native and recombinant murine LIF-A, at 37&deg; C. (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>) and at 0&deg; C. (not shown). Medium from uninduced yeast cells and from yeast cells containing the vector YEpsec1 alone did not. Thus there appears to be a strong IS conservation of the receptor binding domain in murine and human LIFs, compatible with the high degree of primary amino acid sequence similarity. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> Human LIF in medium conditioned by galactose-induced yeast cells containing the YEpsec 1/HLIF recombinant was purified using steps 2 and 4 of Example 1, except that the LIF activity binding to the DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column and eluted with the salt gradient was pooled in step 2. Purified yeast-derived human LIF was radioiodinated by incubating 1 &mgr;g of human LIF in 50 &mgr;l of 0.2M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, with 1 mCi of Na <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I (2.7 &mgr;l) and 5 &mgr;l of 0.2 mM IC1 in 2M NaCl for 60 sec. <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I-LIF was separated from unincorporated <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I by passage of the reaction mixture through a column of Sephadex G-25M (Pharmacia) equilibrated in phosphate buffered (20 mM, pH 7.4) saline (0.15M) containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 0.02% sodium azide. Human <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I-LIF electrophoresed on a 8-25% gradient sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel as a single broad band with apparent molecular weight of 170,000.

Purified yeast-derived human LIF (approx. 10 &mgr;g) was subjected to amino-terminal amino acid sequencing as described in Example 2 and gave a single sequence of:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> This is identical to the predicted amino acid sequence of human LIF (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>) except that the sequence begins at the fourth amino acid compared to the start of the murine sequence (see Example 2) which is:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> This indicates that the purified yeast-derived human LIF is missing the corresponding first three amino acids of the mouse sequence but is still biologically active and still able to bind to the murine LIF receptor.

<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> Step 1: Medium conditioned by several human cell lines were assayed for their capacity to induce the differentiation and inhibit the proliferation of M1 murine myeloid leukaemic cells in semi-solid agar cultures (as described in Example 5, Step 4 of the present application). Several cell lines produced such an activity, of which the bladder carcinoma cell line 5637 produced the highest levels. However, the 5637 cell line has been shown previously to produce human G-CSF (Nicola, N. A. et al, <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>314: 625-628, 1985; Welte, K. et al, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>82: 1526-1530, 1985) which is also active in inducing differentiation of M1 cells (Tomida, M. et al, <highlight><italic>FEBS Lett. </italic></highlight>207: 271-275, 1986; Neckers, L. M. and Pluznik, D. H. <highlight><italic>Exp. Hematol. </italic></highlight>15: 700-703, 1987). To confirm that 5637 cells produced authentic human LIF (in addition to G-CSF), 5637-conditioned medium was further subjected to Steps 2 and 3 below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> Step 2: Medium conditioned by 5637 cells was concentrated 20-fold and tested for its ability to compete for the binding of native murine <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I-LIF-A to specific cellular receptors on murine peritoneal cells. This competition binding assay was as disclosed in Step 5 of Example 5 in the present application. 5637 cell-conditioned medium contained activity capable of competing for the binding of murine <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I-LIF-A to cellular receptors and this activity was concentrated in the DEAE non-binding fraction of 5637 CM (LIF-A) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</cross-reference>). Since human and murine G-CSF do not compete, even at very high concentrations, for <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I-LIF-A binding sites, this establishes the presence in 5637-conditioned medium of a homologous human LIF activity capable of recognizing specifically the murine LIF receptor. This indicates strong conservation of the murine and human LIFs in their receptor binding domain, compatible with the high degree of primary amino acid sequence homology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0219" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0219&rsqb;</number> Step 3: Medium conditioned by human bladder carcinoma 5637 cells (two liters in 10% v/v foetal calf serum) was concentrated to 40 ml and chromatographed sequentially on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and lentil-lectin-Sepharose 4B as described previously for murine LIF from Krebs II ascites cell-conditioned medium. M1 differentiation-inducing activity from 5637 cells (putative human LIF) chromatographed in a very similar fashion to murine LIF on DEAE-Sepharose, with some activity not binding to the column (LIF-A), while the remainder bound and was eluted during the salt gradient (LIF-B) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</cross-reference>). Similarly, the putative human LIF behaved like murine LIF on lentil-lectin-Sepharose chromatography with a proportion of activity binding to the column indicating the presence of mannose-containing carbohydrates on the glycoprotein (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</cross-reference>). Thus by its cross-reactivity in inducing murine M1 cell differentiation, its ability to recognize specifically the murine LIF cellular receptor, and its biochemical fractionation characteristics, the human activity in 5637 cell conditioned media meets the criteria of the native human analogue of murine LIF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0220" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0220&rsqb;</number> Native human LIF from 5637 cell conditioned medium. was purified by steps 2 and 4 of Example 1, pooling the non-binding LIF activity from step 2 and the binding LIF activity from step 4. This pooled LIF activity was fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC as for step 5 of Example 1 except that a Brownlee RP300 C8 column was used twice, first using a gradient from 0-60% CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>CN in 0.1% TFA and then using a gradient from 45-55% CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>CN in 0.1% TFA. In the second gradient human LIF eluted at 50% CH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>CN and when electrophoresed on 8-25% gradient sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gels showed a major silver staining band of apparent molecular weight 73,000. Native purified human LIF was radioiodinated as described in step of Example 10 and bound specifically to murine M1 cells and mouse bone marrow cells as described for yeast-derived human <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I-LIF (step 5 of Example 11). </paragraph>
