<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An optical fiber connector adapter has a sensing mechanism for determining when the adapter has a connector plug therein and when the adapter is vacant or empty. The sensing mechanism creates an indication of the state of the adapter which is transmitted to a control circuit. The control circuit responds to the indication by activating or deactivating a laser, for example, which applies optical energy to the adapter. The laser is deactivated when the adapter has no connector plug therein and is activated when there is a connector plug in place in the adapter. In two of the embodiments of the invention, the sensing mechanism signals the impending insertion or withdrawal of the connector plug relative to the adapter. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to optical connection adapters for use in fiber optical transmission and, more particularly, to an adapter for creating an electrical indication of the condition of the connector. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Optical fiber transmission systems are becoming widely used in the transmission of signals such as data, voice and the like, and in many instances, are replacing traditional electrical systems. Many of the arrangements common to electrical systems, such as coupling, interconnection, splicing, and the like have their counterparts in optical systems but, because of the totally different characteristics of the transmission media, i.e., optical fiber versus metallic wire, connectorization, splicing, and the like involve quit a different apparatus. Where, for example, it is necessary to make a great number of connections in one location, both systems may use what is referred to in the art as patch panels, which provide arrays of connector adapters for interconnection, but the interconnections themselves are generally quite different. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is common practice in the optical connector art to terminate a length of optical fiber with a connector, an example of which is the SC type connector that is shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,212,752 of Stephenson et al. There are numerous types of such fiber terminating connectors, and, inasmuch as there has been little effort directed to standardization, each type of connector generally requires a different coupling arrangement to permit interconnection of two fibers, for example. The SC and LC connectors are becoming more and more popular, and the remainder of the discussion, in the interest of simplicity, is devoted to such connectors. It is to be understood that the following description of the principles and apparatus of the invention is applicable to other types of connectors as well. As is shown in the Stephenson et al. patent, an SC connector includes a ferrule assembly including a barrel having a collar at one end and an optical fiber terminating ferrule projecting from the barrel. The ferrule assembly is disposed in a plug frame such that an end portion of the ferrule projects from one end of the frame. The plug frame is configured to snap lock into a grip member having a locating key thereon, and the grip is inserted into one side of a slotted coupler adapter, with the locating key inserted into the slot. The grip of a corresponding SC connector is inserted into the other side of the adapter so that the ends of the ferrules abut each other to form a low insertion loss optical interconnection. In the SC connector, the ferrules are spring loaded longitudinally to insure contact between the fiber containing ferrule ends. The entire interconnect operation involves linear motion only and results in a low insertion loss, mechanically stable, protected junction between the two fibers. The expenditure of time in making the interconnection is small and the operator or installer is relieved of having to perform anything other than simple linear motion in plugging the connectors into the coupling adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When large numbers of such interconnections are to be made, it is common practice to use patch panels for holding an array of a large number of coupler adapters. Thus, there can literally be hundreds of such adapters, all in close proximity to each other, mounted in the panel. As long as only a single type of connector, such as the SC connector, is involved, simple adapters may be used for plugging in the connectors from each side of the patch panel. In view of the fact that there are several different types of connectors in widespread use today, it has become common practice to replace the simple adapters with buildout blocks or buildout coupling adapters. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,274,729 of King, et al., there is shown a buildout coupling adapter system in a patch panel that makes possible interconnections among the several different types of connectors in any combination thereof. As can be seen in that patent, a buildout block at one side (or end) thereof is configured the same as a simple coupler adapter having a keyway for receiving, for example, an SC connector. The other end of the buildout block is formed to receive a buildout which may be configured to receive and hold, for example, an SC, an ST, an LC, or an FC connector. Thus, the patch panel may be, on one side thereof, pre-connectorized with optical fibers all of which are terminated by SC connectors, and the other side of the panel is ready to receive pre-connectorized fibers terminated by any one of the numerous connectors. Such an arrangement is more versatile and adaptable than those arrangements which are limited to a single type of pre-connectorized fiber. Such an arrangement also functions well in those installations where one side of the panel is not readily accessible. Thus, the panel can be pre-connectorized before mounting in position on the side which will be relatively inaccessible, after which it can be mounted in place, ready to receive the numerous connections thereto, regardless of connector type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In any such arrangement there is a potential safety hazard that is often present. Where one or more of the pre-connectorized fibers is carrying optical energy, such energy can be emitted from the end of the fiber connector and pass through the unoccupied buildout block or coupling adapter to the side of the panel where connections are to be made. This optical energy can be harmful for the operator or installer and can be especially harmful to his or her eyes. This hazard is most prevalent when an active connection has to be repaired, cleaned, or otherwise altered by removing an existing connectorized fiber and replacing it with another. In such an instance, it might be difficult or otherwise impractical to shut off the signal transmission in that particular fiber circuit, hence, the installer is forced to deal with a light emitting junction or connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This hazard has long been recognized and there are numerous arrangements in the prior art for blocking any light emanating from a fiber connection through an open adapter. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,678,268 of Stephenson, et al., there is shown a pivotable optical shutter arrangement wherein a normally closed pivotable shutter blocks the open exit of an adapter when a connector plug is removed. The shutter advantageously requires only one motion to open it to permit insertion of a plug or connector into the adapter. Such a shutter as shown in the patent is operable by only one hand instead of prior art arrangements which generally require awkward use of two hands by the installer. One of the disadvantages of any shutter arrangement however, is that they are easily &ldquo;defeatable&rdquo; in that they can be, during installation of large numbers of connectors and in the interest of expedition, for example, temporarily fixed in the open position, thus contravening their purpose. In addition, the fiber optic transmission art has progressed to the use of higher and higher light energy or power, and has reached a point where shutter arrangements in general have, because of the large light energy, become transparent to much of that energy in the form of infra-red light, which is commonly used. Additionally, when the light intensity is very high, actual damage to the optical connector and the associated fibers can occur. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention is an optical fiber connector adapter assembly wherein the adapter has a sensing mechanism comprising a switching arrangement incorporated therein for signaling associated circuitry to cut off the emission from the light source that supplies the connector plug remaining in the adapter when the first plug is removed. As a consequence, the cessation of light energy emanating from the open receptacle of the adapter assembly is complete, not subject to easy defeat, and eliminates or at least reduces the possibility of damage to the connection, fibers, and users. As will be apparent hereinafter, in some embodiments of the invention, an impending disconnect or connect is signaled, thereby eliminating possible injury to the installer during extraction of the first plug. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a first illustrative embodiment of the invention, an adapter has first and second leaf springs extending into the plug receiving opening and positional to be pressed into contact with each other when a first plug is inserted into the adapter. The springs are attached to a suitable external circuit, such as a circuit board mounted on or adjacent the adapter, which, upon contact with each other by the leaf springs produces a control signal for turning on the light source, e.g., laser, connected to the second plug already in the adapter. Conversely, when the first plug is removed from the adapter, the circuit is broken and the laser to the second plug is turned off. Thus, the two leaf springs function as a safety switch to prevent light from emanating from an open adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a second illustrative embodiment of the invention, a light emitting device, such as an LED is mounted in one side wall of the adapter and a light detector in the opposite wall thereof. Thus, light, such as a beam, from the LED directed across the plug receiving portion of the adapter to the detector is detected thereby, in the absence of a first plug, and causes a signal to be directed to a suitable control circuit to prevent the light which normally is directed to a second plug from reaching the adapter generally by extinguishing the laser. When the first plug is inserted into the adapter, it blocks the light path between the LED and detector and the control signal circuit is broken, thereby allowing the laser to the second plug to be turned on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the invention, a Hall effect device, which detects the presence of a magnetic field, is mounted in the adapter on, for example, an end wall thereof or on a circuit board mounted on or in the adapter. In this embodiment, the first plug has a small magnet mounted on the front plug end. When the first plug is inserted into the adapter it is moved forward until it seats therein, at which point the Hall effect device detects the presence of the magnet and produces a signal which, when applied to a control circuit, permits the light (laser) supplying the second plug to be turned on. When the first plug is removed, the magnet is no longer detected and the Hall effect device no longer produces a signal. In the absence of such a signal, the control circuit turns the laser off, or otherwise prevents light from reaching the connector end of the second plug. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments of the invention as thus far described the sensing mechanisms produces a signal, either make or break, upon the axial insertion or withdrawal of the first plug. It is often desirable, however, to produce an advance warning of the impending insertion or withdrawal to lessen possible exposure of the operator to light within the adapter while maintaining the simplicity of the foregoing embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment for producing an advance warning, advantage is taken of the LC connector structure which has a cantilevered latching arm thereon for latching the plug to the adapter in the operative position. In order to remove the first plug from the adapter, the latching arm must be depressed to unlatch the plug and enable its removal. In this embodiment of the invention, a Hall effect device is contained in or mounted to the adapter on the outside thereof, and the latching arm has a small magnet affixed thereto near its distal end. The location of the Hall device in the adapter, which is made of a suitable plastic material, is such that it detects the presence of the magnet when the first plug is mounted in its operative position. However, when the latching arm is depressed, the magnet moves away from the Hall device to where the magnetic field thereof is no longer easily detectable and the Hall device signals the control circuit of this condition so that the control circuit shuts off the light supplied to the second plug, even though the first plug has not yet been withdrawn. Thus, the light to the second plug is shut of in anticipation off the removal of the first plug. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment for producing an advance warning, a cantilevered leaf spring contact is disposed in the region of the adapter in which the cantilevered latching arm resides when the plug is inserted therein, and a contact pin is affixed within the region adjacent the latching shoulder. When the plug is inserted into the adapter, the latching arm is depressed until the latching lugs or shoulders thereon pair the latching shoulder in the adapter, at which time the arm springs up to engage the latch and the latching lugs and arm force the leaf spring into contact with the contact pin, completing the circuit. When the plug is to be removed, it is necessary that the latching arm first be depressed, breaking the circuit as the latch or latches are disengaged, at which point the latching lugs no longer bear against the leaf spring and it disengages from the contact to break the circuit which the plug is still within the adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In still another embodiment of the invention, use is made of the shutter arrangement of the previously mentioned U.S. Pat. No. 5,678,268. Each sidewall of the pivotable shutter has a depending leg near the distal end of one of which is a light emitting device, e.g. an LED, and the distal end of the other of which is a light detecting device. When the shutter is closed, i.e., there being no first plug in the adapter, the light circuit is completed and the power to the second plug is disabled. However, when the shutter is pivoted upward, the circuit is broken and power to the second plug is resumed. In the &apos;268 patent, it is shown how pivoting the shutter upward is a function of the plug itself, thus the plug is at least partially inserted before power to the second plug is resumed, thereby protecting the operator. On the other hand, as the first plug is withdrawn, the locations of the LED and detector are such that the power to the second plug is cut off before the first plug is fully withdrawn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The various principles and features of the present invention are, as will be seen hereinafter, adaptable to numerous other arrangements. While the safety aspects of the present invention are of paramount importance and are treated in detail, the switching capability of the adapter might readily be adapted for other uses that might occur to workers in the art. These principles and features and the advantages thereof will be more readily apparent from the following detailed description, read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective view of a quadruplex jack receptacle or adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> mounted on a panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and locked thereto by locking members <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is made of suitable plastic material and members <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are molded into the top and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> respectively. An optical connector <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of, for example, the LC type is shown mounted in one of the four rectangular cavities <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a similar connector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is shown positioned for insertion into another of the cavities <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> thereof. Each connector comprises a housing <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and cover <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that enclose fiber holding structure. Connector <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has a bend limiting boot <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and terminates a cable <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. In like manner, connector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also terminates a cable, not shown. Both connectors <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> include a plug end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is insertable in one of the cavities of adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As best seen with connector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, each connector includes latching tab or arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, molded as part of connector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which serves to lock the connector within its receptacle, the cavity. Arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a &ldquo;living hinge&rdquo; which allows it to be moved up and down relative to the central axis of the connector. Arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has first and second protruding latching lugs or shoulders <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> which, when plug or connector <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is fully inserted within adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, mate with latching surfaces <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of stop members <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> within the adapter. In order for the latch to be disengaged so that plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be removed, latching arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> must be depressed to where latching lugs <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> no longer engage surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A trigger <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is also molded as part of the connector and has a free end overlying the distal end of arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Trigger <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has a &ldquo;living hinge&rdquo; and when its distal or free end is depressed, it depresses the distal end of arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to unlatch the connector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from the adapter (or jack receptacle) <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. It is to be understood that the adapter and connection shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are intended to be representative of several different types of connectors and adapters therefor, as is the assembly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and shows a second, mating adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which mates with the adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each of the adapters having mating flanges <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which form, or are extensions of, end walls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the adapters <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Each end wall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has a protruding cylindrical member <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> having a bore therein, which, when the adapters are mated aligns with a corresponding bore in the other adapter. The two aligned bores contain an alignment sleeve <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> into which the optical fiber containing ferrules <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the two connectors <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are inserted in butting relationship. When fully inserted in the mated adapters <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the ends of ferrules <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are maintained in abutment by means of springs <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, for example. When in this configuration, optical energy is transmitted from one connector to the other with minimized loss. It can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> that if the right hand connector <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is removed, light energy in the left hand connector <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> will be directed through the now empty cavity <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the right hand adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in an unimpeded path. As discussed hereinbefore, this creates a hazardous condition, especially when the transmitted light is high intensity or power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> depict a first embodiment of the present invention which is directed to minimizing or eliminating the hazardous condition described in the foregoing. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a partial view in cross-section of that portion of the connector assembly of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> involving the region of abutment of the connector ferrules <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional elevation view taken along the line A-A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> first leaf spring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of, for example, beryllium copper, is mounted to flange <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and extends into the rectangular cavity <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, preferably bearing against wall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, spring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is positioned between cylindrical member <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and a side wall <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> of the adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Spring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be molded into the adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, or it may be riveted or otherwise mounted to flange <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. A second spring <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> extends from an opposite wall of adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, substantially parallel to and overlying spring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> with a small separation therebetween as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> thereby forming a normally open leaf spring switch. A first electrical lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is connected to the proximal end <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of spring <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and a second electrical lead <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is connected to the proximal end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. When a plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is inserted into the rectangular cavity <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> it is advanced until latching arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> latches it to the adapter. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the plug end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in this position, surrounds cylindrical member <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and penetrates to a point closely adjacent end wall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and, as a consequence, depresses second spring member <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> into contact with spring member <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, thereby completing an electrical connection between leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Thus, the combination of springs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> function as a switch, or, more generically, as a sensing mechanism which registers the presence of a fully inserted connector <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> within adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic view of the system <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the present invention, showing the mating adapters <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> mounted to the panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, with a first connector plug <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> about to be inserted into an adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to mate with (abut) a second connector plug <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> positioned and latched into its adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Connector plug <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is shown supplied with an optical input from, for example, a laser <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, hence in the arrangement shown, connector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;live&rdquo; when laser <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is on. Leads <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> lead to a control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which, when the spring contacts <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are not in contact, thereby forming an open switch, circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> generates a control signal which is applied to laser <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> through a suitable connection <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to, for example, a switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> on laser <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> to maintain it in the unenergized, or off, state. When the second plug connector <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> is inserted into its adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> until seated therein, spring members <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are pressed into contact with each other, as explained hereinbefore, and the circuit to control member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is closed. Control member <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> then generates an &ldquo;on&rdquo; signal which is applied to switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to turn the laser <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> on so that normal signal transmission can occur. From the foregoing, it can be appreciated that the switch formed by the springs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> functions as a sensing mechanism for sensing the presence or absence of a plug connector in the adapter, and signaling other circuit elements accordingly The operator or installer is thus protected from the harmful effects of laser light emerging unimpeded from an unoccupied opening or receptacle in the adapter. Control element <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can take any of a number of forms, the design of which are well within the purview of workers in the art and, where the arrangement calls for a voltage source, element <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> can so function. In addition, it is possible to eliminate the control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and apply a signal directly to the light source <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> in certain circumstances. In the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it is understood that the sensing mechanism formed by the leaf springs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is part of a circuit within control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> including a voltage (or current) source which is part of the signal generating mechanism activated upon closure of the switch formed by leaf springs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a perspective view of another embodiment of the invention, of which <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a front elevation view and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a plan view in cross-section along the line A-A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. To avoid confusion, parts in these figures that correspond to like parts in preceding figures bear the same reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> depicts first and second mated adapters <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Mounted in diametrically opposed openings in side walls <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> of adapter <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are a light source <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, such as, for example, an LED, and a light detector <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> preferably directly opposite source <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. Lead <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> which can actually be more than one wire connects the light source <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to the control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> which supplies the necessary power thereto, and lead <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which can also be, if necessary, more than one wire, connects the detector <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to the control circuit. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, in the absence of a plug connector in the receptacle <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of adapter <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, light from source <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> impinges on detector <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, thereby providing an indication of the absence of a connector to control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, which thereupon generates a control signal to turn laser <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> off. When a plug connector is inserted into receptacle <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, the light beam from source <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to detector <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is interrupted, and detector <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> does not send a light indicating signal to circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. In the absence of such a signal, the laser <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is switched on and normal operation of the connection obtained. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, insertion of a plug connector into the adapter completed a circuit to the control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, but in the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, insertion of a plug connector into the adapter, breaks a circuit of which the light beam is a part. Thus, control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is, in the first instance, programmed to turn the laser on, and, in the second instance, to turn the laser off. It is a simple matter to produce the necessary circuitry in circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to accomplish the desired response to insertion and removal of a plug connector relative to the adapter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9, 10</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> depict an embodiment of the device which makes use of a Hall effect device as the sensing mechanism. Elements in these figures that correspond to elements in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> bear the same reference numerals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, it can be seen that flanges <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> have a slot <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> cut therein at their junction which contains a circuit board <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> which extends into adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the cylindrical member <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, board <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> has a Hall Effect device <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> mounted on the lower portion thereof. As is known, such a Hall Effect device detects the presence of a magnetic field. To this end, connector plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has mounted on its front end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> a small magnet <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>. When the plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is inserted into the adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> until it is seated, as shown in dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the magnet <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> is immediately adjacent the Hall device <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which detects its magnetic field. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the Hall device <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which is biased by a voltage V<highlight><subscript>&plus;</subscript></highlight>, which is applied thereto by lead <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> from a suitable voltage source, which can be, for example, control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, when it detects a magnetic field, causes a transistor <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to be activated. Transistor <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is biased by voltage V<highlight><subscript>&plus;</subscript></highlight> over lead <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and resistor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, and generates an output signal over lead <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which is applied to control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in turn, turns on laser switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to activate laser <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. When connector plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is removed, by depressing latching arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and pulling it out of opening <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, as the magnet <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> moves away from reusing member (the Hall device <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>) its magnetic field is no longer detected in sufficient strength to activate transistor <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, whereby the signal to control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> ceases and circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> turns laser <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> off by deactivating switch <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. It is to be understood that the circuit arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is representative of any of a number of possible circuits for accomplishing the foregoing operation which are within the purview of workers in the art. From the foregoing it can be seen that the Hall device senses the presence (or absence) of a connector plug relative to adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and insures that unimpeded laser light will not be emitted through an empty or unoccupied adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a perspective view of a variation of the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 through 12</cross-reference> wherein the sensing mechanism comprises the circuit board <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> containing the Hall Effect device <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> mounted in a side wall <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> of adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with device <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> preferably being flush with the inner surface of wall <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. Mounted on or in the latching arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a magnet <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> which, when connector plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is fully seated within adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is immediately adjacent the Hall device <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> for detection of its magnetic field and thus signaling control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of its presence in the adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in the manner explained hereinbefore. When connector plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is removed from the adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, latching arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is depressed, thereby moving magnet <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> away from the Hall device <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> a distance sufficient to where its magnetic field is no longer detectable by the Hall device <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which results in laser <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> being deactivated before connector plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is removed. This arrangement signals the impending removal of the connector plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the laser <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is deactivated before the plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is fully withdrawn. Thus, the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> has the additional safety feature of deactivation of the laser <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> while the plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is still within adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, but while it is being removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14, 15</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are views of still another embodiment of the invention, which represents a modification of the optical shutter arrangement of U.S. Pat. No. 5,687,268 of Stephenson et al, which also incorporates the additional safety feature of advance warning to the control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> that a connector plug is about to be inserted into, or removed from the adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The embodiment of these figures comprises an adapter assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</cross-reference> has an adapter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which has an empty receptacle, and a pivotable shutter <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> which covers the opening of the receptacle, as shown. Shutter <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is pivoted on pivot pin <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> when a connector plug <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is inserted in the receptacle of adapter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Shutter <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> also has a flange member <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> for pivoting shutter <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> by means of connector plug <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> when the plug is being inserted into adapter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, as explained in detail in the aforementioned Stephenson et al. &apos;268 patent. Shutters <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> has first and second depending arms <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which extend below the lower surface of adapter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> which is an elevation view in cross-section along the line A-A of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. At the distal end of arm <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is mounted a light emitting device <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> such as an LED, and the distal end of arm <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> has a light detecting device <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> for detecting light emitted from device <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. Thus, when there is no connector in adapter assembly <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, more specifically, in adapter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the shutter member <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is closed and, ordinarily, light is blocked from exiting adapter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and light emitted from device <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is detected by device <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, which signals control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> that one receptacle of adapter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is empty. As a consequence, circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> deactivates laser <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, as discussed hereinbefore. This additional safety measure is most useful where the signals carried in the fibers to the adapter are of high power level, as pointed out hereinbefore. When a connector plug <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is to be inserted into adapter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the plug is used to pivot the shutter <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> upward toward the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. As the shutter <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> pivots, the light path between devices <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is interrupted and blocked by the body of adapter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Thus control circuit <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> no longer receives a signal from device <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, and, in response to the absence of the signal, activates laser <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. It will be apparent to those in the art that the length of arms <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and the location thereon of device <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> can determine at which point in the insertion or extraction of the connector plug the laser is activated or deactivated. Thus, the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14, 15</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can signal the impending insertion or removal of the connector plug, thereby adding an additional increment of safety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</cross-reference> there is shown another embodiment of the invention which, like the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, signals the impending removal of the connector plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> from the adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. As can best be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17, a</cross-reference> cantilevered leaf spring <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, which may be made of suitable conducting material having a high degree of spring to it, such as beryllium copper, is mounted in suitable fashion in adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The mounting arrangement shown is intended to represent any of a number of possible mounting arrangements which position the cantilevered leg of spring <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> in the region of space <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> that accommodates the latching arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of connector plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, with the tip <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> thereof almost aligned with latching surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It is preferable that tip <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> be positioned as shown so that it does not interfere with either plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> or latching arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is inserted into adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. At the corner formed by latching surfaces <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the wall, and extending above the tip <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> and spaced therefrom is a fixed conductive contact member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. Leads <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are connected to spring <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and contact <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, spring <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is substantially equal to the slot <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which contains latching arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> when plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is fully inserted in adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and contact <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> bridges the gap, as shown. Spring member <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> can be, if desired, wider than is shown, since it is not contained in slot <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and there is ample room within adapter <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> for a wider cantilevered spring <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. It is also possible, if desired, to offset spring <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> from the centerline of adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</cross-reference>, when connector plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is being inserted into adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, latching arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is depressed, initially by the operator and then by the downward camming action of members <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> bearing against latching lugs <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. As a consequence, initially latching arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> does not engage end <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> of spring <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, and the electrical circuit remains open, thereby reducing the hazard of laser light escaping through adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, as discussed hereinbefore. As lugs <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> pass the surfaces <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and they are no longer held down by the camming action of the bottom surfaces of stop member <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the resilience of arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> causes it to spring upward to bring the lugs <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to bear against surfaces <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. At the same time, the arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and lugs <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> engage the end <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> of spring <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and force it into electrical contact with contact member <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, closing the electrical circuit and turning the laser on. The embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17, 18</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> therefore represent a virtually completely safe arrangement. Without a plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> being inserted in adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the laser is off and the operator or installer is protected from any potentially harmful radiation. The laser is not turned only until the plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is fully inserted and the latches seated or matched. When the plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is to be withdrawn, depression of arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a necessary first step in unlatching plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> from adapter <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and such depression of arm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> turns off the laser by breaking the circuit. Thus, the operator or installer is substantially completely protected since the laser is only on when the plug is fully inserted. </paragraph>
