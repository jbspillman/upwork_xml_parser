<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an aromatic polycarbonate resin composition. More specifically, it relates to an aromatic polycarbonate resin composition which has high stiffness, high impact resistance, a good surface appearance and excellent recyclability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Aromatic polycarbonate resins and resin compositions obtained by blending thermoplastic polyesters such as a polyethylene terephthalate resin and a polybuthylene terephthalate resin or ABS resin with an aromatic polycarbonate resin are widely used in a variety of fields such as automobiles and OA equipment as a thermoplastic resin which has excellent mechanical properties such as impact strength and a material which retains excellent characteristic properties of aromatic polycarbonate resins and improves chemical resistance and moldability which are defects of aromatic polycarbonate resins, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As means of improving the stiffness and the like of aromatic polycarbonate resins and resin compositions comprising an aromatic polycarbonate resin as the main ingredient, there are proposed a method of blending a fibrous filler such as glass fiber (JP-A 54-94556, JP-A 6-49344) (the term &ldquo;JP-A&rdquo; as used herein means an &ldquo;unexamined published Japanese patent application&rdquo;) and a method of blending a scaly or platy inorganic filler such as talc or mica (JP-A 55-129444, U.S. Pat. No. 4,280,949, JP-A 5-222283). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An aromatic polycarbonate resin reinforced with a fibrous filler such as glass fiber or carbon fiber and a resin composition comprising this aromatic polycarbonate as the main ingredient have excellent mechanical strength such as stiffness. However, they have such problems that a coating film must be made extremely thick to obtain a good coating appearance because the floating of the fibrous filler such as glass fiber or carbon fiber is observed markedly in the appearances of the molded products obtained by a general molding method and that dimensional stability is not satisfactory that the molded products are readily warped because anisotropy in molding shrinkage and the like is large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, an aromatic polycarbonate resin obtained by blending a scaly or platy inorganic filler such as talc or mica and a resin composition comprising this aromatic polycarbonate resin as the main ingredient are superior in the appearances of their molded products and dimensional stability to an aromatic polycarbonate resin reinforced with a fibrous filler such as glass fiber or carbon fiber and a resin composition comprising this aromatic polycarbonate resin as the main ingredient. However, their application ranges are limited due to their small reinforcing effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Wollastonite particles are an inorganic filler which has excellent properties of the above two. The wollastonite particles have a fibrous form when they are finely ground because of the crystal structure. Therefore, they can provide characteristic properties different from those of the above fibrous and platy fillers to a resin composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> For example, JP-A 7-90118 discloses a resin composition which comprises wollastonite including trace components (Fe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) in a specific proportion and a thermoplastic resin. The publication teaches that the wollastonite easily gets a fibrous form and is hardly broken. It further discloses that the obtained resin composition has high strength and elastic modulus and excellent surface smoothness and dimensional accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> JP-A7-149948, EP639613A1 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,965,655disclose resin compositions which comprise wollastonite needle-like particles having a number average fiber length of 1 to 50 &mgr;m and a number average fiber diameter of 0.1 to 10 &mgr;m and a thermoplastic resin such as an aromatic polycarbonate resin. They teach that the wollastonite needle-like particles are preferably particles which include particles having a fiber length of 5 to 25 &mgr;m in a proportion of at least 50% of the total. They further disclose that the resin compositions disclosed by the above publications satisfy requirements such as a coating appearance with high distinctness of image and a low linear expansion coefficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> JP-A 9-12846 discloses a resin composition which comprises an aromatic polycarbonate resin, aromatic polyester resin and wollastonite having an aspect ratio of 3 to 50 in a specific ratio. The publication teaches that the resin composition has high stiffness, excellent impact resistance and provides a coated molded product having excellent surface smoothness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> JP-A 10-60251 discloses a resin composition which comprises an aromatic polycarbonate resin having a specific molecular weight, aromatic polyester resin, wollastonite having an aspect ratio of 3 to 50 and carboxyl group modified olefin wax and which has excellent blow moldability. The publication teaches that the resin composition has excellent drawdown properties required for blow molding and high chemical resistance and provides a coated molded product having excellent surface smoothness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> JP-A 10-324789 discloses a resin composition which comprises an aromatic polycarbonate resin having a specific molecular weight, thermoplastic graft copolymer such as ABS resin, wollastonite having an aspect ratio of 3 to 50 and carboxyl group modified olefin wax and which has excellent blow moldability. It teaches that the resin composition has excellent drawdown properties required for blow molding and high impact resistance and provides a coated molded product having excellent surface smoothness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> JP-A 2000-256505 discloses a resin composition which comprises wollastonite including trace components (Fe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) in a specific proportion and a thermoplastic resin. It teaches that the wollastonite preferably has an average fiber length of 20 to 50 &mgr;m, an average fiber diameter of 0.5 to 5 &mgr;m and an average aspect ratio of 7 to 100 and that the resin composition gives a molded product having high stiffness and heat resistance, excellent surface smoothness, high tinting properties and a good appearance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As described above, a resin composition having high rigidity and an excellent surface appearance can be obtained from wollastonite. Wollastonite is particularly preferred as an inorganic filler for a thermoplastic resin mainly composed of an aromatic polycarbonate resin. In the case of a thermoplastic resin mainly composed of an aromatic polycarbonate resin, as the base resin has high impact resistance, a resin composition having high stiffness and high impact resistance can be obtained. Further, in the case of a thermoplastic resin mainly composed of an aromatic polycarbonate resin, the appearance of a molded product of a resin composition containing an inorganic filler is apt to worsen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> However, the above prior art is still unsatisfactory in some points. The first point is that deterioration in the appearance of a coated molded product occurs not a little. The occurrence of a deteriorated appearance affects product yield and production efficiency. The above resin composition containing wollastonite particles is used in a molded product which must have a great coating appearance based on its excellent surface smoothness. However, projecting foreign matter may be slightly formed on the surface of the molded product. The projecting foreign matter becomes extremely conspicuous when the entire surface is flat. Therefore, the suppression of the formation of the projecting foreign matter may be required of the resin composition which comprises an aromatic polycarbonate resin and wollastonite particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The second point is the recycling of a molded product. Since the wollastonite particles are a filler which is easily broken, when melt kneading is repeated for recycling, mechanical properties such as stiffness are liable to deteriorate. Deterioration in characteristic properties is marked in the case of a resin composition mainly composed of an aromatic polycarbonate resin having a high melt viscosity. Therefore, a reduction in the change of characteristic properties caused by repeating recycling may be required of the resin composition which comprises an aromatic polycarbonate resin and wollastonite particles. </paragraph>

Thereby, a reduction in the molecular weight of the aromatic polycarbonate resin caused by a reaction with wollastonite can be suppressed. As a result, excellent recyclability can be achieved.

The reason why the electron microscope is used is that it is difficult to measure accurately the size of level to deal with using the optical microscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As for fiber diameter, wollastonite particles whose fiber diameters are to be measured are selected at random from the image obtained by observation through the electron microscope to measure the fiber diameters at a site close to the center portion. A number average fiber diameter is calculated from the obtained measurement values. Since a recent electron microscope has the function of calculating the length from its observation image, the fiber diameter can be calculated relatively easily. The magnification of observation is about 1,000&times; and the number of samples is 1,000 or more. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Any mill maybe used to mill wollastonite as the component C such that conditions for the above particle shape characteristics are satisfied, as exemplified by a high-speed rotary mill, ball mill, medium stirring mill and jet mill.

<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> It is preferred to obtain wollastonite particles of interest by classifying the milled wollastonite particles to remove a component having a large fiber length. The above classification is carried out by putting the wollastonite particles through a net sieve or by using an impactor type inertia classifier (such as a Variable Impactor), wtilizing Coanda effect type inertia classifier (such as an Elbow Jet), spiral airstream type centrifugal classifier (such as a multi-stage cyclone), free vortex helical airstream type centrifugal classifier equipped with a guide blade (such as Mikroplex or dispersion separator), forced vortex helical airstream type centrifugal classifier equipped with a rotary classifying chamber (such as Acucut or Turbo Classifier), or forced vortex helical airstream type centrifugal classifier equipped with a rotary blade (such as Micron Separator or Super Separator).

When the number average fiber length is 3 &mgr;m or more, it is advantageous in terms of stiffness and strength. Although the surface smoothness improves as the number average fiber diameter decreases, when the number average fiber diameter is 0.5 &mgr;m or more, the fibrous particles are hardly broken, which is advantageous in improving recyclability. </paragraph>

The number proportion of particles having a fiber length of more than 25 &mgr;m is preferably 4% or less, more preferably 3.5% or less of the total. The lower limit is 0.5%. </paragraph>

By satisfying the above condition, the formation of projecting foreign matter can be further suppressed, whereby deterioration in a coating appearance can be reduced. The proportion of the particles passing through a 325-mesh sieve is preferably 99.97 wt % or more. To obtain wollastonite particles which satisfies the above condition, the above net sieve or centrifugal classifier is preferably used to classify the wollastonite particles after milling. </paragraph>

The wollastonite particles are placed on a 325-mesh sieve (based on ASTM standards), water is poured onto the sieve for 3 minutes, and then the wollastonite particles on the sieve are dried with a heating lamp for 5 minutes. The sample remaining on the sieve is removed with a brush carefully and weighed by the electronic balance (the weight is &bgr; g). The proportion of the wollastonite particles passing through the 325-mesh sieve is calculated from the values &agr; (g) and &bgr; (g) based on the equation ((&agr;&minus;&bgr;)&times;100/&agr;) (wt %). </paragraph>

Further, a flame retardant having the above weight reduction temperature is also excellent in thermal stability. Therefore, when it is melt kneaded repeatedly, its volatilization from the resin composition and its thermal decomposition rarely occur. Further, the hydrolysis resistance (moist heat resistance) of the aromatic polycarbonate resin caused by the hydrolysis of the aromatic phosphate-based flame retardant is greatly improved when the flame retardant is used in conjunction with the wollastonite particle. As a result, a resin composition having excellent recyclability is obtained owing to the above effect. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Out of these, the resin component consisting of the component A and the component B-2 is particularly preferred. Since this resin component has high fluidity, high impact strength, little warpage and platability, it is suitably used to obtain thin molded housings for electronic and electric equipment which require high flame retardancy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> The aromatic polycarbonate resin composition of the present invention may contain polytetrafluoroethylene (may be abbreviated as PTFE hereinafter) as component H to further improve flame retardancy. </paragraph>

Although an aromatic polycarbonate resin composition can be suitably formulated for each purpose, an aromatic polycarbonate resin composition containing a phosphorus-based heat stabilizer is particularly preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> The phosphorus-based heat stabilizer is phosphorous acid, phosphoric acid, phosphonous acid, phosphonic acid or ester thereof. Illustrative examples of the phosphorus-based heat stabilizer include phosphite compounds such as triphenyl phosphite, tris (nonylphenyl) phosphite, tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphite, tridecyl phosphite, trioctyl phosphate, trioctadecyl phosphite, didecylmonophenyl phosphate, dioctylmonophenyl phosphite, diisopropylmonophenyl phosphate, monobutyldiphenyl phosphate, monodecyldiphenyl phosphate, monooctyldiphenyl phosphite, bis(2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenyl)pentaerythritol diphosphite, 2,2-methylenebis (4,6-di-tert-butylphenyl) octylphosphite, bis(nonylphenyl)pentaerythritol diphosphite and bis (2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphite; phosphate compounds such as tributyl phosphate, trimethyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, triphenyl phosphate, trichlorophenyl phosphate, triethyl phosphate, diphenylcresyl phosphate, diphenylmonoorthoxenyl phosphate, tributoxyethyl phosphate, dibutyl phosphate, dioctyl phosphate and diisopropyl phosphate; and phosphonite compounds such as tetrakis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)-4,4&prime;-biphenylene diphosphonite, tetrakis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)-4,3&prime;-biphenylene diphosphonite, tetrakis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)-3,3&prime;-biphenylene diphosphonite and bis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)-4-biphenylene phosphonite. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> Out of these, trisnonylphenyl phosphate, distearyl pentaerythritol diphosphite, bis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)pentaerythritol diphosphite, bis(2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenyl)pentaerythritol diphosphite, tris(2,4,-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphite, triphenyl phosphate, trimethyl phosphate, tetrakis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)-4,4&prime;-biphenylene diphosphonite and bis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)-4-biphenylene phosphonite are preferred. </paragraph>

The amount of the heat stabilizer is preferably 0.0001 to 1 part by weight, more preferably 0.0005 to 0.5 part by weight, much more preferably 0.002 to 0.3 part by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total of the component A and optionally the component B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> When the resin component consists of the aromatic polycarbonate resin (component A) and the aromatic polyester resin (component B-1), pentaerythritol diphosphite compounds such as distearyl pentaerythritol diphosphite, bis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)pentaerythritol diphosphite and bis(2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenyl)pentaerythritol diphosphite are preferred out of these. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> The reason why they are preferred is as follows. A reduction in the molecular weight of the aromatic polycarbonate resin as the component A of the resin component consisting of the components A and B-1 readily occurs along with the ester exchange reaction between the components A and B-1 at the time of melt kneading. The ester exchange reaction is promoted by the existence of a silicate filler such as a wollastonite. The pentaerythritol diphosphite compounds are hydrolyzed more easily than other phosphate compounds. The acid component formed by hydrolysis suppresses the effect of promoting the ester exchange reaction of the wollastonite, thereby making it possible to obtain an aromatic polycarbonate resin composition which rarely experiences a reduction in molecular weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The amount of the pentaerythritol diphosphite compound is preferably 0.005 to 1 part by weight, more preferably 0.05 to 1 part by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the total of the components A and B-1. </paragraph>

Hindered amine-based optical stabilizers typified by bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl)sebacate and bis(1,2,2,6,6-pentamethyl-4-piperidyl)sebacate may also be used. Further, hydroxyphenyl triazine-based compounds such as 2-(4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine-2-yl)-5-hexyloxyphenol and 2-(4,6-bis(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2-yl)-5-hexyloxyphenol may also be used.

<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> To produce the thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention, any method is employed. For example, the components A and C and optionally other components are pre-mixed and melt kneaded together and then pelletized. The pre-mixing means is a tumbler, V-shaped blender, Henschel mixer, Nauta mixer, ribbon mixer, mechanochemical device, extrusion mixer or the like. An extrusion granulator or briquetting machine may be used for granulation in the pre-mixing step. After pre-mixing, a melt kneader typified by a vented twin-screw extruder is used to melt knead the above components and a pelletizer is used to pelletize the obtained product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> The components A and C and optionally other components may be supplied into a melt kneader typified by twin-screw extruder independently without pre-mixing. Some of the components A and C and optionally other components may be pre-mixed together and supplied into a melt kneader together with the remainder. For example, the component C may be supplied into an extruder using a side feeder independently. The pre-mixing means and granulation are the same as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> When components to be mixed together include a liquid component, a so-called liquid injector or liquid adder may be used to supply it into a melt kneader.

Therefore, it is preferred to melt knead the component A or B-1 which has been dried by hot air or electromagnetic waves or under vacuum. Vent suction is preferably carried out at a not so high degree of vacuum during melt kneading. Volatiles may be discharged to the outside of the system while nitrogen gas and the like is caused to circulate in a state close to the atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Various products can be produced by obtaining moldings by injection molding pellets of the thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention. In the injection molding, not only general cold runner molding but also hot runner molding which eliminates the need of a runner can be employed to produce the moldings. In injection molding, gas assist injection molding, injection compression molding, ultra high speed injection molding, injection press molding, insert molding, molding with local high-temperature metal mold (including molding with insulated metal mold), sandwich molding, two-color molding and the like can be employed in addition to general molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there are provided moldings formed from an aromatic polycarbonate resin composition which comprises 100 parts by weight of a resin component consisting of (1) 50 to 100 wt % of an aromatic polycarbonate resin (component A) and (2) 0 to 50 wt % of at least one thermoplastic resin (component B) selected from the group consisting of a thermoplastic polyester resin (component B-1) and a styrene unit component-containing resin having a rubber component content of less than 40wt % (component B-2), and (3) 1 to 100 parts by weight of wollastonite particles (component C) having such particle shape characteristics that the particles have a number average fiber length measured by the method specified in this text of 10 &mgr;m or less and a number average fiber diameter measured by the method specified in this text of 4 &mgr;m or less and include particles having a fiber length of 5 to 25 &mgr;m in a number proportion of less than 50% of the total. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Preferably, there are provided coated moldings formed from the above polycarbonate resin compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The thus obtained moldings of the present invention have excellent surface appearance, impact strength, stiffness and recyclability. More specifically, the moldings have a retention of recyclability defined in the following Examples of at least 85%, preferably 90%, more preferably 93%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> As described above, the present invention provides an aromatic polycarbonate resin composition which has high stiffness, high impact resistance, a good surface appearance and excellent recyclability. The characteristic properties of the resin composition are useful in a wide variety of industrial fields and application purposes and particularly useful in the following fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> Firstly, the resin composition can be used in car interior parts and car exterior parts. This field requires an especially good surface appearance. The car interior parts include center panels, instrumental panels, dash boards, inner door handles, rear boards, and display housings for car navigation and car TV sets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> The car exterior parts include outer door handles, fender panels, door panels, spoilers, garnishes, pillar covers, front grilles, rear body panels, cowls for motor bicycles, and covers for the load carrying platforms of trucks. When a resin component consists of an aromatic polycarbonate resin and a thermoplastic polyester resin or when a resin component consists of an aromatic polycarbonate resin and a styrene unit component-containing resin having a rubber component content of less than 40 wt %, the resulting resin composition is particularly suitable for use in these parts. When a resin component consists of an aromatic polycarbonate resin and a thermoplastic polyester resin, the obtained resin composition is further superior in chemical resistance and fatigue strength and therefore particularly suitable for use in outer door handles which require these characteristic properties. A resin component which consists of an aromatic polycarbonate resin and a styrene unit component-containing resin having a rubber component content of less than 40 wt % is advantageous in terms of impact resistance and superior in moldability, the obtained resin composition is suitable for use in large-sized moldings such as door panels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> Secondly, the resin composition can be used in housing parts for portable precision instruments. The portable precision instruments include cameras, digital cameras, video movie players, telescopes, binoculars, portable telephones, personal disital assistant, portable notebook computer, portable tape recorders, portable optical disk players, portable navigation systems and wristwatches. The housing parts are being thinned and require high stiffness and high dimensional accuracy for positioning a precision part. Further, as these portable precision instruments are carried, high impact resistance is required and an excellent surface appearance is required to provide a high-grade impression. A resin component which consists of an aromatic polycarbonate resin and a styrene unit component-containing resin having a rubber component content of less than 40 wt % is suitable for housing parts. The resin component is advantageous for thin products in terms of dimensional accuracy and impact resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Thirdly, the resin composition can be used in housing parts for OA equipment. The OA equipment include notebook computer, personal computer bodies, CRT displays, printers, copies, drive units for recording media (such as CD and DVD), scanners and facsimiles. Since these parts require flame retardancy, a resin component which consists of an aromatic polycarbonate resin or a resin component which consists of an aromatic polycarbonate resin and a styrene unit component-containing resin having a rubber component content of less than 40 wt % is particularly suitable. The flame retardant is preferably a phosphorus-based flame retardant such as aromatic phosphate-based flame retardant, red phosphorus or phosphazene polymer-based flame retardant. When the resin component consists of an aromatic polycarbonate resin, a silicone-based flame retardant or organic salt-based flame retardant is preferred. A resin composition comprising a resin component which consists of an aromatic polycarbonate resin and a styrene unit component-containing resin having a rubber component content of less than 40 wt % and an aromatic phosphate-based flame retardant (particularly a phosphate oligomer) as a flame retardant is particularly useful from the viewpoints of flame retardancy and moldability.</paragraph>

This mixture was heated at 200&deg; C. and molten under agitation. After most of the formed phenol was distilled off in an hour under heating at a reduced pressure of 4 KPa and a polymerization reaction was carried out for 2 hours by further elevating the temperature to 270&deg; C. and at a reduced pressure of 1 Torr. 0.0035 part (about 6&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;6 </superscript></highlight>mols/1 mol of bisphenol A) of tetrabutylphosphonium dodecylbenzene sulfonate in a molten state was then added as a catalyst neutralizer to continue the reaction at 270&deg; C. and 1.33 KPa or less so as to obtain an aromatic polycarbonate resin having a viscosity average molecular weight of 23,300 and a terminal hydroxyl group concentration of 34 mol %. This aromatic polycarbonate resin was supplied into an extruder by a gear pump. 0.008 wt % of tris (2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphite was added before the extruder to obtain an aromatic polycarbonate resin pellet. This was designated as PC-3. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0223" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0223&rsqb;</number> As is obvious from these tables, it can be said that an aromatic polycarbonate resin composition comprising a resin component which consists of an aromatic polycarbonate resin, or an aromatic polycarbonate resin and a thermoplastic polyester resin or styrene unit component-containing resin, and wollastonite particles which satisfy the conditions of the present invention is excellent in mechanical properties such as stiffness and impact strength, surface appearance and recyclability. When wollastonite particles which do not satisfy the conditions of the present invention are used, the obtained resin composition contains a large number of projecting foreign matter and is inferior in recyclability though its coated surface has relatively high smoothness. It is also understood that the proportion of particles having a fiber length of more than 25 &mgr;m, the proportion of particles passing through a 325-mesh sieve and ignition loss affects the formation of projecting foreign matter and recyclability. </paragraph>
