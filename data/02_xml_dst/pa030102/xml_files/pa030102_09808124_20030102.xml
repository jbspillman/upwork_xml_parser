<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is in the fields of molecular and cellular biology. The invention is generally related to reverse transcriptase enzymes and methods for the reverse transcription of nucleic acid molecules, especially messenger RNA molecules. Specifically, the invention relates to reverse transcriptase enzymes which have been mutated or modified to increase fidelity, and/or decrease terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity, and to methods of producing, amplifying or sequencing nucleic acid molecules (particularly cDNA molecules) using these reverse transcriptase enzymes or compositions. The invention also relates to nucleic acid molecules produced by these methods and to the use of such nucleic acid molecules to produce desired polypeptides. The invention also concerns kits comprising such enzymes or compositions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> cDNA and cDNA Libraries </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In examining the structure and physiology of an organism, tissue or cell, it is often desirable to determine its genetic content. The genetic framework of an organism is encoded in the double-stranded sequence of nucleotide bases in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which is contained in the somatic and germ cells of the organism. The genetic content of a particular segment of DNA, or gene, is only manifested upon production of the protein which the gene encodes. In order to produce a protein, a complementary copy of one strand of the DNA double helix (the &ldquo;coding&rdquo; strand) is produced by polymerase enzymes, resulting in a specific sequence of ribonucleic acid (RNA). This particular type of RNA, since it contains the genetic message from the DNA for production of a protein, is called messenger RNA (mRNA). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Within a given cell, tissue or organism, there exist a myriad of mRNA species, each encoding a separate and specific protein. This fact provides a powerful tool to investigators interested in studying genetic expression in a tissue or cell&mdash;mRNA molecules may be isolated and further manipulated by various molecular biological techniques, thereby allowing the elucidation of the full functional genetic content of a cell, tissue or organism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One common approach to the study of gene expression is the production of complementary DNA (cDNA) clones. In this technique, the mRNA molecules from an organism are isolated from an extract of the cells or tissues of the organism. This isolation often employs solid chromatography matrices, such as cellulose or agarose, to which oligomers of thymidine (T) have been complexed. Since the 3&prime; termini on most eukaryotic mRNA molecules contain a string of adenosine (A) bases, and since A binds to T, the mRNA molecules can be rapidly purified from other molecules and substances in the tissue or cell extract. From these purified mRNA molecules, cDNA copies may be made using the enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT), which results in the production of single-stranded cDNA molecules. The single-stranded cDNAs may then be converted into a complete double-stranded DNA copy (i.e., a double-stranded cDNA) of the original mRNA (and thus of the original double-stranded DNA sequence, encoding this mRNA, contained in the genome of the organism) by the action of a DNA polymerase. The protein-specific double-stranded cDNAs can then be inserted into a plasmid or viral vector, which is then introduced into a host bacterial, yeast, animal or plant cell. The host cells are then grown in culture media, resulting in a population of host cells containing (or in many cases, expressing) the gene of interest. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This entire process, from isolation of mRNA to insertion of the cDNA into a plasmid or vector to growth of host cell populations containing the isolated gene, is termed &ldquo;cDNA cloning.&rdquo; If cDNAs are prepared from a number of different mRNAs, the resulting set of cDNAs is called a &ldquo;cDNA library,&rdquo; an appropriate term since the set of cDNAs represents a &ldquo;population&rdquo; of genes comprising the functional genetic information present in the source cell, tissue or organism. Genotypic analysis of these cDNA libraries can yield much information on the structure and function of the organisms from which they were derived. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Retroviral Reverse Transcriptase Enzymes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Three prototypical forms of retroviral RT have been studied thoroughly. Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV) RT contains a single subunit of 78 kDa with RNA-dependent DNA polymerase and RNase H activity. This enzyme has been cloned and expressed in a fully active form in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>(reviewed in Prasad, V. R., <highlight><italic>Reverse Transcriptase, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, p.135 (1993)). Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) RT is a heterodimer of p66 and p51 subunits in which the smaller subunit is derived from the larger by proteolytic cleavage. The p66 subunit has both a RNA-dependent DNA polymerase and an RNase H domain, while the p51 subunit has only a DNA polymerase domain. Active HIV p66/p51 RT has been cloned and expressed successfully in a number of expression hosts, including <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>(reviewed in Le Grice, S. F. J., <highlight><italic>Reverse Transcriptase, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory press, p. 163 (1993)). Within the HIV p66/p51 heterodimer, the 51-kD subunit is catalytically inactive, and the 66-kD subunit has both DNA polymerase and RNase H activity (Le Grice, S. F. J., et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO Journal </italic></highlight>10:3905 (1991); Hostomsky, Z., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Virol. </italic></highlight>66:3179 (1992)). Avian Sarcoma-Leukosis Virus (ASLV) RT, which includes but is not limited to Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) RT, Avian Myeloblastosis Virus (AMV) RT, Avian Erythroblastosis Virus (AEV) Helper Virus MCAV RT, Avian Myelocytomatosis Virus MC29 Helper Virus MCAV RT, Avian Reticuloendotheliosis Virus (REV-T) Helper Virus REV-A RT, Avian Sarcoma Virus UR2 Helper Virus UR2AV RT, Avian Sarcoma Virus Y73 Helper Virus YAV RT, Rous Associated Virus (RAV) RT, and Myeloblastosis Associated Virus (MAV) RT, is also a heterodimer of two subunits, &agr; (approximately 62 kDa) and &bgr; (approximately 94 kDa), in which &agr; is derived from &bgr; by proteolytic cleavage (reviewed in Prasad, V. R., <highlight><italic>Reverse Transcriptase, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1993), p. 135). ASLV RT can exist in two additional catalytically active structural forms, &bgr;&bgr; and &agr; (Hizi, A. and Joklik, W. K., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>252: 2281 (1977)). Sedimentation analysis suggests &agr;&bgr; and &bgr;&bgr; are dimers and that the &agr; form exists in an equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric forms (Grandgenett, D. P., et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>70: 230 (1973); Hizi, A. and Joklik, W. K., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>252: 2281 (1977); and Soltis, D. A. and Skalka, A. M., <highlight><italic>Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>85: 3372 (1988)). The ASLV &agr;&bgr; and &bgr;&bgr; RTs are the only known examples of retroviral RT that include three different activities in the same protein complex: DNA polymerase, RNase H, and DNA endonuclease (integrase) activities (reviewed in Skalka, A. M., <highlight><italic>Reverse Transcriptase, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1993), p. 193). The &agr; form lacks the integrase domain and activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Various forms of the individual subunits of ASLV RT have been cloned and expressed. These include a 98-kDa precursor polypeptide that is normally processed proteolytically to &bgr; and a 4-kDa polypeptide removed from the &bgr; carboxy end (Alexander, F., et al., <highlight><italic>J. Virol. </italic></highlight>61: 534 (1987) and Anderson, D. et al., <highlight><italic>Focus </italic></highlight>17:53 (1995)), and the mature &bgr; subunit (Weis, J. H. and Salstrom, J. S., U.S. Pat. No. 4,663,290 (1987); and Soltis, D. A. and Skalka, A. M., <highlight><italic>Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>85:3372 (1988)). Heterodimeric RSV &agr;&bgr; RT has also been purified from <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>cells expressing a cloned RSV &bgr; gene (Chernov, A. P., et al., <highlight><italic>Biomed. Sci. </italic></highlight>2:49 (1991)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Various domains of the reverse transcriptases have also been identified, for example, the thumb, fingers and palm regions. The thumb region is of particular importance in that, mutations in this region have been shown to reduce the incidence of frame shifting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Reverse Transcription Efficiency and Fidelity </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the conversion of mRNA into cDNA by RT-mediated reverse transcription is an essential step in the study of proteins expressed from cloned genes. However, the use of unmodified RT to catalyze reverse transcription is inefficient for at least two reasons. First, RT sometimes renders an RNA template unable to be copied before reverse transcription is initiated or completed, primarily due to the intrinsic RNase H activity present in RT. Second, RTs generally have low fidelity. That is, RTs incorporate mismatched bases during cDNA synthesis thus producing cDNA products having sequence errors. RTs have in fact been shown to incorporate one base error per 3000-6000 nucleotides for HIV RT, and 1/10,000 nucleotide for AMV RT during cDNA synthesis (Berger, S. L., et al., <highlight><italic>Biochemistry </italic></highlight>22:2365-2372 (1983); Krug, M. S., and Berger, S. L., <highlight><italic>Meth. Enzymol. </italic></highlight>152:316 (1987); Berger et al. <highlight><italic>Meth. Enzymol. </italic></highlight>275: 523 (1996)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Removal of the RNase H activity of RT can eliminate the first problem and improve the efficiency of reverse transcription (Gerard, G. F., et al., <highlight><italic>FOCUS </italic></highlight>11(4):60 (1989); Gerard, G. F., et al., <highlight><italic>FOCUS </italic></highlight>14(3):91 (1992)). However such RTs (&ldquo;RNase H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>&rdquo; forms) do not address the second problem of improving the fidelity of reverse transcription. The present invention addresses this need. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides reverse transcriptase enzymes, compositions comprising such enzymes and methods useful in overcoming the efficiency limitations of reverse transcription. In general, the invention provides compositions for use in high fidelity reverse transcription of a nucleic acid molecule comprising one or more polypeptides having reverse transcriptase activity of the invention. Such compositions may further comprise one or more nucleotides, a suitable buffer, and/or one or more DNA polymerases. The compositions of the invention may also comprise one or more oligonucleotide primers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The reverse transcriptases of the invention are preferably modified or mutated such that the fidelity of the enzyme is increased or enhanced. Additional embodiments of the invention include reverse transcriptases that are modified to decrease or eliminate terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) activity. The reverse transcriptases of the invention are preferably single chained (single-subunit) or multi-chained (multi-subunit), and are reduced or substantially reduced in RNase H activity, and most preferably are enzymes selected from the group consisting of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV) H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> reverse transcriptase, Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> reverse transcriptase, Avian Myeloblastosis Virus (AMV) H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> reverse transcriptase, Rous Associated Virus (RAV) H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> reverse transcriptase, Myeloblastosis Associated Virus (MAV) H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> reverse transcriptase and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> reverse transcriptase or other ASLV H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> reverse transcriptases. In preferred compositions, the reverse transcriptases are present at working concentrations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Enzymes of the invention include reverse transcriptases which exhibit reverse transcriptase activity either upon the formation of multimers (e.g., dimers) or as individual protein molecules (i.e., in monomeric form). Examples of reverse transcriptases which exhibit reverse transcriptase activity upon the formation of multimers include AMV, RSV and HIV reverse transcriptases. An example of a reverse transcriptases which exhibits reverse transcriptase activity as separate, individual proteins include M-MLV and RSV reverse transcriptase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Multimeric reverse transcriptases of the invention may form homo-multimers or hetero-multimers. In other words, the subunits of the multimeric protein complex may be identical or different. One example of a hetero-dimeric reverse transcriptase is AMV reverse transcriptase, which is composed of two subunits that differ in primary amino acid sequence. More specifically, as already discussed, AMV reverse transcriptase may be composed of two subunits wherein one of these subunits is generated by proteolytic processing of the other. Thus, dimeric AMV reverse transcriptase may be composed of subunits of differing size that share regions of amino acid sequence identity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates in particular to mutant or modified reverse transcriptases wherein one or more amino acid changes have been made which renders the enzyme more faithful (higher fidelity) in nucleic acid synthesis. The preferred sites for mutation or modification to produce higher fidelity polymerases are listed for some reverse transcriptases in Table 1. Similar or equivalent sites or corresponding sites in other reverse trancriptases can be mutated to produce higher fidelity reverse transcriptases.

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The invention further includes M-MLV RT having the following mutations: V223H, Q190F, T197A, T197E, Y64W, R116M and K152R as well as other RTs having corresponding mutations or modifications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention is also directed to mutant or modified reverse transcriptases wherein one or more amino acid changes have been made which decrease or eliminate terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) activity. The preferred sites for these mutations include, but are not limited to, F309, T197 and Y133 of M-MLV RT. Specific mutations or modifications of M-MLV RT include T197E, which reduces TdT activity to a level undetectable by assay methods described herein; and T197A, which reduces TdT activity, to a lesser extent. Similar or equivalent sites or corresponding sites in other reverse transcriptases can be mutated to produce reverse transcriptases with reduced, substantially reduced or eliminated TdT activities. Examples of such equivalent sites include, but are not limited to, W266 and I194 in HIV RT, W267 and A95 in AMV RT, and W267 and A95 in RSV RT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In specific embodiments, reverse transcriptases of the invention may not include M-MLV RT, HIV RT, AMV RT, or RSV RT. Thus, for example, in certain embodiments the invention includes RTs with increased fidelity that are not HIV RTs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention is also directed to DNA molecules (preferably vectors) containing a gene or nucleic acid molecule encoding the mutant or modified reverse transcriptases of the present invention and to host cells containing such DNA molecules. Any number of hosts may be used to express the gene or nucleic acid molecule of interest, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Preferably, prokaryotic cells are used to express the polymerases of the invention. The preferred prokaryotic host according to the present invention is <highlight><italic>E. coli. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to a method of producing the reverse transcriptases of the invention, said method comprising: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> (a) culturing the host cell comprising a gene or nucleic acid molecule encoding a reverse transcriptase of the invention (preferably such RT gene is contained by a vector within the host cell); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> (b) expressing said gene or nucleic acid molecule; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> (c) isolating said reverse transcriptase from said host cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The invention is also directed to methods for making one or more nucleic acid molecules, comprising mixing one or more nucleic acid templates (preferably one or more RNA templates and most preferably one or more messenger RNA templates) with one or more reverse transcriptases of the invention and incubating the mixture under conditions sufficient to make a first nucleic acid molecule or molecules complementary to all or a portion of the one or more nucleic acid templates. In a preferred embodiment, the first nucleic acid molecule is a single-stranded cDNA. Nucleic acid templates suitable for reverse transcription according to this aspect of the invention include any nucleic acid molecule or population of nucleic acid molecules (preferably RNA and most preferably mRNA), particularly those derived from a cell or tissue. In a preferred aspect, a population of mRNA molecules (a number of different mRNA molecules, typically obtained from cells or tissue) are used to make a cDNA library, in accordance with the invention.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In the description that follows, a number of terms used in recombinant DNA, virology and immunology are extensively utilized. In order to provide a clearer and consistent understanding of the specification and claims, including the scope to be given such terms, the following definitions are provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Cloning vector. A plasmid, cosmid or phage DNA or other DNA molecule which is able to replicate autonomously in a host cell, and which is characterized by one or a small number of restriction endonuclease recognition sites at which such DNA sequences may be cut in a determinable fashion without loss of an essential biological function of the vector, and into which DNA may be spliced in order to bring about its replication and cloning. The cloning vector may further contain a marker suitable for use in the identification of cells transformed with the cloning vector. Markers, for example, are tetracycline resistance or ampicillin resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Expression vector. A vector similar to a cloning vector but which is capable of enhancing the expression of a gene or nucleic acid molecules which has been cloned into it, after transformation into a host. The cloned gene or nucleic acid molecule is usually placed under the control of (i.e., operably linked to) certain control sequences such as promoter sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Recombinant host. Any prokaryotic or eukaryotic or microorganism which contains the desired cloned genes or nucleic acid molecule in an expression vector, cloning vector or any DNA molecule. The term &ldquo;recombinant host&rdquo; is also meant to include those host cells which have been genetically engineered to contain the desired gene or nucleic acid molecule on the host chromosome or genome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Host. Any prokaryotic or eukaryotic microorganism that is the recipient of a replicable expression vector, cloning vector or any DNA molecule. The DNA molecule may contain, but is not limited to, a structural gene, a promoter and/or an origin of replication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Promoter. A DNA sequence generally described as the 5&prime; region of a gene, located proximal to the start codon. At the promoter region, transcription of an adjacent gene(s) is initiated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Gene. A DNA sequence that contains information necessary for expression of a polypeptide or protein. It includes the promoter and the structural gene as well as other sequences involved in expression of the protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Structural gene. A DNA sequence that is transcribed into messenger RNA that is then translated into a sequence of amino acids characteristic of a specific polypeptide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Operably linked. As used herein means that the promoter is positioned to control the initiation of expression of the polypeptide encoded by the structural gene or other nucleic acid molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Expression. Expression is the process by which a gene or other nucleic acid molecule produces a polypeptide. It includes transcription of the gene or nucleic acid molecule into messenger RNA (mRNA) and the translation of such mRNA into polypeptide(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Substantially Pure. As used herein &ldquo;substantially pure&rdquo; means that the desired purified protein is essentially free from contaminating cellular contaminants which are associated with the desired protein in nature. Contaminating cellular components may include, but are not limited to, phosphatases, exonucleases, endonucleases or undesirable DNA polymerase enzymes. Prefered reverse transcriptases of the invention are substantially pure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Primer. As used herein &ldquo;primer&rdquo; refers to a single-stranded oligonucleotide that is extended by covalent bonding of nucleotide monomers during amplification or polymerization of a DNA molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Template. The term &ldquo;template&rdquo; as used herein refers to a double-stranded or single-stranded nucleic acid molecule which is to be amplified, copied or sequenced. In the case of a double-stranded DNA molecule, denaturation of its strands to form single-stranded first and second strands is performed before these molecules may be amplified, copied or sequenced. A primer, complementary to a portion of a nucleic acid template is hybridized under appropriate conditions and the reverse transcriptase of the invention may then synthesize a DNA molecule complementary to said template or a portion thereof. The newly synthesized DNA molecule, according to the invention, may be equal or shorter in length than the original template. Mismatch incorporation during the synthesis or extension of the newly synthesized DNA molecule may result in one or a number of mismatched base pairs. Thus, the synthesized DNA molecule need not be exactly complementary to the template. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Incorporating. The term &ldquo;incorporating&rdquo; as used herein means becoming a part of a DNA molecule or primer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Oligonucleotide. &ldquo;Oligonucleotide&rdquo; refers to a synthetic or natural molecule comprising a covalently linked sequence of nucleotides which are joined by a phosphodiester bond between the 3&prime; position of the pentose of one nucleotide and the 5&prime; position of the pentose of the adjacent nucleotide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Nucleotide. As used herein &ldquo;nucleotide&rdquo; refers to a base-sugar-phosphate combination. Nucleotides are monomeric units of a nucleic acid sequence (DNA and RNA) and deoxyribonucleotides are &ldquo;incorporated&rdquo; into DNA by DNA polymerases. The term nucleotide includes deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates such as dATP, dCTP, dITP, dUTP, dGTP, dTTP, or derivatives thereof. Such derivatives include, for example, &lsqb;aS&rsqb;dATP, 7-deaza-dGTP and 7-deaza-dATP. The term nucleotide as used herein also refers to dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (ddNTPs) and their derivatives. Illustrated examples of dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates include, but are not limited to, ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, ddITP, and ddTTP. According to the present invention, a &ldquo;nucleotide&rdquo; may be unlabeled or detectably labeled by well known techniques. Detectable labels include, for example, radioactive isotopes, fluorescent labels, chemiluminescent labels, bioluminescent labels and enzyme labels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Hybridization. The terms &ldquo;hybridization&rdquo; and &ldquo;hybridizing&rdquo; refer to the pairing of two complementary single-stranded nucleic acid molecules (RNA and/or DNA) to give a double-stranded molecule. As used herein, two nucleic acid molecules may be hybridized, although the base pairing is not completely complementary. Accordingly, mismatched bases do not prevent hybridization of two nucleic acid molecules provided that appropriate conditions, well known in the art, are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Terminal extension. Terminal extension, as used herein, refers to the ability of a reverse transcriptase (RT) to add additional bases on to the 3&prime; end of a newly synthesized cDNA strand beyond the 5&prime; end of the mRNA template. The activity may add bases specifically (with a nucleotide bias) or randomly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Terminal extension activity is also known as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) activity. A reverse transcriptase having decreased or eliminated TdT activity is defined as any reverse transcriptase having lower TdT activity than the specific activity of the corresponding unmutated, unmodified or wild type enzyme, particularly, less than about 75% of the specific activity of the corresponding unmutated, unmodified or wild type enzyme, less than about 50% of the specific activity of the corresponding unmutated, unmodified or wild type enzyme, less than about 25% of the specific activity of the corresponding unmutated, unmodified or wild type enzyme, less than about 15% of the specific activity of the corresponding unmutated, unmodified or wild type enzyme, less than 10% of the specific activity of the corresponding unmutated, unmodified or wild type enzyme, less than about 5% of the specific activity of the corresponding umnutated, unmodified or wild type enzyme, or less than about 1% of the specific activity of the corresponding unmutated, unmodified or wild type enzyme. Eliminated TdT activity is defined as a level of activity that is undetectable by the assay methods utilized in Example 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Strand jumping. Strand jumping, as used herein, refers to a type of random mutation caused by an RT &ldquo;skipping&rdquo; more than one (e.g., two, five, ten, fifty, one-hundred, etc.) nucleotides on the mRNA template, resulting in a deletion of the corresponding nucleotides in the resulting cDNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Hand domain. The hand domain, as used herein, refers to those amino acids which are in the area or areas that control the template, primer, or nucleotide interaction of the reverse transcriptase. This domain is further characterized by a group of three regions of secondary structure in a reverse transcriptase enzyme, the thumb, fingers and palm regions. The thumb domain is defined as residing between amino acids 240-315 of HIV RT, or between amino acids 280-355 of M-MLV RT. The fingers domain is defined as residing between amino acids 1-85 and 120-154 of HIV RT, or between 1-124 and 161-193 of M-MLV RT. The palm domain is defined as residing between amino acids 86-199 and 155-239 of HIV RT, or between amino acids 125-160 and 193-279 of M-MLV RT. These areas are generally defined, and the amino acids defining the N-termini and C-termini are approximate. Corresponding regions can also be defined for other reverse transcriptases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Fidelity. Fidelity refers to the accuracy of polymerization, or the ability of the reverse transcriptase to discriminate correct from incorrect substrates, (e.g., nucleotides) when synthesizing nucleic acid molecules which are complementary to a template. The higher the fidelity of a reverse transcriptase, the less the reverse transcriptase misincorporates nucleotides in the growing strand during nucleic acid synthesis; that is, an increase or enhancement in fidelity results in a more faithful reverse transcriptase having decreased error rate or decreased misincorporation rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> A reverse transcriptase having increased/enhanced/higher fidelity is defined as a polymerase having any increase in fidelity, preferably about 1.5 to about 10,000 fold, about 2 to about 5,000 fold, or about 2 to about 2000 fold (preferably greater than about 5 fold, more preferably greater than about 10 fold, still more preferably greater than about 50 fold, still more preferably greater than about 100 fold, still more preferably greater than about 500 fold and most preferably greater than about 100 fold) reduction in the number of misincorporated nucleotides during synthesis of any given nucleic acid molecule of a given length compared to the control reverse trancriptase. Preferably, the mutant or modified RT of the invention is compared to the corresponding unmodified or wild-type RT to determine the relative enhancement or increase in fidelity. For example, a mutated reverse transcriptase may misincorporate one nucleotide in the synthesis of a nucleic acid molecule segment of 1000 bases compared to an unmutated reverse transcriptase misincorporating 10 nucleotides in the same size segment. Such a mutant reverse transcriptase would be said to have an increase of fidelity of 10 fold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Fidelity can also be measured by the decrease in the incidence of frame shifting, as described in Example 5. A reverse transcriptase having increased fidelity is defined as a polymerase or reverse transcriptase having any increase in fidelity with respect to frame shifting, as compared to a control reverse transcriptase (e.g., a wild-type RT), for example, a reverse transcriptase having greater than about 1.5 fold increased fidelity with respect to frame shifting, having greater than about 5 fold increased fidelity with respect to frame shifting, having greater than about 10 fold increased fidelity with respect to frame shifting, having greater than about 20 fold increased fidelity with respect to frame shifting, having greater than about 30 fold increased fidelity with respect to frame shifting, or having greater than about 40 fold increased fidelity with respect to frame shifting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A reverse transcriptase having increased/enhanced/higher fidelity, with respect to frame shifting, can also be defined as a reverse transcriptase or polymerase having any increase in fidelity, such as about 1.5 to about 10,000 fold, about 2 to about 5,000 fold, about 2 to about 2000 fold, about 1.5 to about 40 fold, about 5 to about 40 fold, about 10 to about 40 fold, about 20 to about 40 fold, about 30 to about 40 fold, about 5 to about 30 fold, about 10 to about 30 fold, about 15 to about 30 fold, about 20 to about 30 fold, about 5 to about 20 fold, about 10 to about 20 fold, about 15 to about 20 fold, about 10 to about 100 fold, about 15 to about 100 fold, about 20 to about 100 fold, about 30 to about 100 fold, or about 50 to about 100 fold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A reverse transcriptase having reduced misincorporation is defined herein as either a mutated or modified reverse transcriptase that preferably has about or less than 50%, or preferably about or less than 25%, more preferably about or less than 10% and most preferably about or less than 1% of relative misincorporation compared to the corresponding unmutated, unmodified or wild type enzyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The fidelity or misincorporation rate of a reverse transcriptase can be determined by sequencing or by other methods known in the art (Eckert &amp; Kunkel, 1990, <highlight><italic>Nuc. Acids Res., </italic></highlight>3739-3744). In one example, the sequence of a DNA molecule synthesized by the unmutated and mutated reverse transcriptase can be compared to the expected (known) sequence. In this way, the number of errors (misincorporation or frame shifts) can be determined for each enzyme and compared. In another example, the unmutated and mutated reverse transcriptase may be used to sequence a DNA molecule having a known sequence. The number of sequencing errors (misincorporation or frame shifts) can be compared to determine the fidelity or misincorporation rate of the enzymes. Other means of determining the fidelity or misincorporation rate include a forward complementation assay using an RNA template as described below and previously in Boyer J. C. et al. <highlight><italic>Methods Enzymol. </italic></highlight>275: 523 (1996), and are set out in the examples. Other methods of determining the fidelity or misincorporation rate will be recognized by one of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> In general, the invention provides compositions for use in reverse transcription of a nucleic acid molecule comprising a reverse transcriptase with one or more mutations or modifications which render the reverse transcriptase more efficient, that is having higher fidelity. The invention also provides compositions for use in reverse transcription of a nucleic acid molecule comprising a reverse transcriptase with one or more mutations or modifications which decrease TdT activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The enzymes in these compositions are preferably present in working concentrations and are reduced or substantially reduced in RNase H activity. Alternatively, the reverse transcriptases used in the compositions of the invention may have RNase H activity. Preferred mutated or modified reverse transcriptases are derived from M-MLV reverse transcriptase, HIV reverse transcriptase, RSV reverse transcriptase, AMV reverse transcriptase, RAV reverse transcriptase, and MAV reverse transcriptase or other ASLV reverse transcriptases or their corresponding RNase H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> derivatives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, any number of mutations can be made to the RTs and in a preferred aspect, multiple mutations can be made to result in an additive fidelity increase. Such mutations include point mutations, frame shift mutations, deletions and insertions, with one or more point mutations preferred. Preferably, oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis is used to create the mutant polymerases which allows for all possible classes of base pair changes at any determined site along the encoding DNA molecule. In general, this technique involves annealing an oligonucleotide complementary (except for one or more mismatches) to a single stranded nucleotide sequence coding for the RT of interest. The mismatched oligonucleotide is then extended by DNA polymerase, generating a double-stranded DNA molecule which contains the desired change in sequence in one strand. The changes in sequence can of course result in the deletion, substitution, or insertion of an amino acid. The double-stranded polynucleotide can then be inserted into an appropriate expression vector, and a mutant or modified polypeptide can thus be produced. The above-described oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis can of course be carried out via PCR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The invention is also directed to methods for reverse transcription of one or more nucleic acid molecules comprising mixing one or more nucleic acid templates, which is preferably RNA or messenger RNA (mRNA) and more preferably a population of mRNA molecules, with a mutant reverse transcriptase of the present invention and incubating the mixture under conditions sufficient to make a nucleic acid molecule or molecules complementary to all or a portion of the one or more templates. To make the nucleic acid molecule or molecules complementary to the one or more templates, a primer (e.g., an oligo(dT) primer) and one or more nucleotides are used for nucleic acid synthesis in the 3&prime; to 5&prime; direction. Nucleic acid molecules suitable for reverse transcription according to this aspect of the invention include any nucleic acid molecule, particularly those derived from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell. Such cells may include normal cells, diseased cells, transformed cells, established cells, progenitor cells, precursor cells, fetal cells, embryonic cells, bacterial cells, yeast cells, animal cells (including human cells), avian cells, plant cells and the like, or tissue isolated from a plant or an animal (e.g, human, cow, pig, mouse, sheep, horse, monkey, canine, feline, rat, rabbit, bird, fish, insect, etc.). Such nucleic acid molecules may also be isolated from viruses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The invention further provides methods for amplifying or sequencing a nucleic acid molecule comprising contacting the nucleic acid molecule with a reverse transcriptase of the present invention. Preferred such methods comprise one or more polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Enzymes for use in the compositions, methods and kits of the invention include any enzyme having reverse transcriptase activity. Such enzymes include, but are not limited to, retroviral reverse transcriptase, retrotransposon reverse transcriptase, hepatitis B reverse transcriptase, cauliflower mosaic virus reverse transcriptase, bacterial reverse transcriptase, Tth DNA polymerase, Taq DNA polymerase (Saiki, R. K., et al., <highlight><italic>Science </italic></highlight>239:487-491 (1988); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,889,818 and 4,965,188), Tne DNA polymerase (WO 96/10640), Tma DNA polymerase (U.S. Pat. No. 5,374,553) and mutants, fragments, variants or derivatives thereof (see, e.g., commonly owned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,948,614 and 6,015,668, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties). Preferred reverse transcriptases for use in the invention include M-MLV RT, AMV RT, RSV RT, RAV RT, MAV RT and generally ASLV reverse transcriptases. As will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, modified reverse transcriptases may be obtained by recombinant or genetic engineering techniques that are routine and well-known in the art. Mutant reverse transcriptases can, for example, be obtained by mutating the gene or genes encoding the reverse transcriptase of interest by site-directed or random mutagenesis. Such mutations may include point mutations, deletion mutations and insertional mutations. Preferably, one or more point mutations (e.g., substitution of one or more amino acids with one or more different amino acids) are used to construct mutant reverse transcriptases of the invention. Fragments of reverse transcriptases may be obtained by deletion mutation by recombinant techniques that are routine and well-known in the art, or by enzymatic digestion of the reverse transcriptase(s) of interest using any of a number of well-known proteolytic enzymes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Preferred enzymes for use in the invention include those that are reduced or substantially reduced in RNase H activity. Such enzymes that are reduced or substantially reduced in RNase H activity may be obtained by mutating the RNase H domain within the reverse transcriptase of interest, preferably by one or more point mutations, one or more deletion mutations, and/or one or more insertion mutations as described above. By an enzyme &ldquo;substantially reduced in RNase H activity&rdquo; is meant that the enzyme has less than about 30%, less than about 25%, 20%, more preferably less than about 15%, less than about 10%, less than about 7.5%, or less than about 5%, and most preferably less than about 5% or less than about 2%, or which lacks the RNase H activity of the corresponding wildtype or RNase H<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> enzyme such as wildtype Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV), Avian Myeloblastosis Virus (AMV) or Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) reverse transcriptases. RTs having reduced or substantially reduced RNase H activity have been previously described (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,244,797; 5,405,776; 5,668,005 and 6,063,608; and WO 98/47912). The RNase H activity of any enzyme may be determined by a variety of assays, such as those described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,244,797; 5,405,776; 5,668,005 and 6,063,608; in Kotewicz, M. L., et al., <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acids Res. </italic></highlight>16:265 (1988); and in Gerard, G. F., et al., <highlight><italic>FOCUS </italic></highlight>14(5):91 (1992), the disclosures of all of which are fully incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Particularly preferred mutated or modified enzymes for use in the invention include, but are not limited to, M-MLV H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> reverse transcriptase, RSV H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> reverse transcriptase, AMV H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> reverse transcriptase, RAV H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> reverse transcriptase, MAV H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> reverse transcriptase and HIV H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> reverse transcriptase. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill, however, that any enzyme capable of producing a DNA molecule from a ribonucleic acid molecule (i.e., having reverse transcriptase activity) that is reduced or substantially reduced in RNase H activity may be equivalently used in the compositions, methods and kits of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Polypeptides having reverse transcriptase activity for use in the invention may be isolated from their natural viral or bacterial sources according to standard procedures for isolating and purifying natural proteins that are well-known to one of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., Houts, G. E., et al, <highlight><italic>J. Virol. </italic></highlight>29:517 (1979)). In addition, the polypeptides having reverse transcriptase activity may be prepared by recombinant DNA techniques that are familiar to one of ordinary skill in the art (see, e.g., Kotewicz, M. L., et al., <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acids Res. </italic></highlight>16:265 (1988); Soltis, D. A., and Skalka, A. M., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>85:3372-3376 (1988)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In a preferred aspect of the invention, mutant or modified reverse transcriptases are made by recombinant techniques. A number of cloned reverse transcriptase genes are available or may be obtained using standard recombinant techniques (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,244,797; 5,405,776; 5,668,005 and 6,063,608 and WO 98/47912). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> To clone a gene encoding a reverse transcriptase which will be modified in accordance with the invention, isolated DNA which contains the reverse transcriptase gene is used to construct a recombinant DNA library in a vector. Any vector, well known in the art, can be used to clone the reverse transcriptase of interest. However, the vector used must be compatible with the host in which the recombinant DNA library will be transformed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Prokaryotic vectors for constructing the plasmid library include plasmids such as those capable of replication in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>such as, for example, pBR322, ColE1, pSC101, pUC-vectors (pUC18, pUC19, etc.: In: <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, </italic></highlight>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1982); and Sambrook et al., In: Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual (2d ed.) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)). Bacillus plasmids include pC194, pC221, pC217, etc. Such plasmids are disclosed by Glyczan, T. In: <highlight><italic>The Molecular Biology Bacilli, </italic></highlight>Academic Press, York (1982), 307-329. Suitable Streptomyces plasmids include pIJ101 (Kendall et al., <highlight><italic>J. Bacteriol </italic></highlight>169:4177-4183 (1987)). Pseudomonas plasmids are reviewed by John et al., (<highlight><italic>Rad. Insec. Dis. </italic></highlight>8:693-704 (1986)), and Igaki, (<highlight><italic>Jpn. J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>33:729-742 (1978)). Broad-host range plasmids or cosmids, such as pCP13 (Darzins and Chakrabarbary, <highlight><italic>J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>159:9-18, 1984) can also be used for the present invention. The preferred vectors for cloning the genes of the present invention are prokaryotic vectors. Preferably, pCP13 and pUC vectors are used to clone the genes of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The preferred host for cloning the reverse transcriptase genes of interest is a prokaryotic host. The most preferred prokaryotic host is <highlight><italic>E. coli. </italic></highlight>However, the desired reverse transcriptase genes of the present invention may be cloned in other prokaryotic hosts including, but not limited to, Escherichia, Bacillus, Streptomyces, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Serratia, and Proteus. Bacterial hosts of particular interest include <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>DH10B, which may be obtained from Life Technologies, a Division of Invitrogen Corporation (Rockville, Md.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Eukaryotic hosts for cloning and expression of the reverse transcriptase of interest include yeast, fungi, and mammalian cells. Expression of the desired reverse transcriptase in such eukaryotic cells may require the use of eukaryotic regulatory regions which include eukaryotic promoters. Cloning and expressing the reverse transcriptase gene in eukaryotic cells may be accomplished by well known techniques using well known eukaryotic vector systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Once a DNA library has been constructed in a particular vector, an appropriate host is transformed by well known techniques. Transformed colonies are plated at a density of approximately 200-300 colonies per petri dish. For selection of reverse transcriptase, colonies are then screened for the expression of a reverse transcriptase as described in the Examples below. Briefly, overnight cultures of individual transformant colonies are assayed directly for RT using a labeled deoxynucleotide and analyzed for the presence of labeled product. If RT activity is detected, the mutant is sequenced to determine which amino acids maintained detectable RT activity. The gene encoding a reverse transcriptase of the present invention can be cloned using techniques known to a person in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Modifications or Mutations of Polymerases </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the polymerase domain, i.e. fingers, palm, thumb regions, as defined herein, specifically those amino acids which are in the area or areas that controls the template, primer, or nucleotide interaction of the reverse transcriptase of interest is modified or mutated in such a way as to produce a mutated or modified reverse transcriptase having increased or enhanced fidelity (decreased misincorporation rate) and/or decreased TdT activity. Modifications or mutations may also be made in other regions in accordance with the invention. One or more mutations may be made in any reverse transcriptase in order to increase fidelity or decrease the TdT activity of the enzyme in accordance with the invention. Such mutations include point mutations, frame shift mutations, deletions and insertions. Preferably, one or more point mutations, resulting in one or more amino acid substitutions, are used to produce reverse trancriptases having enhanced or increased fidelity or decreased or eliminated TdT activity. The numbering of amino acids in the M-MLV reverse transcriptase is based on the mature peptide, in which the N-terminal methionine has been proteolytically removed. In a preferred aspect of the invention, one or more mutations at positions equivalent or corresponding to position Y64, R116, D152, Q190, T197, D124, H126, Y133 and V223 of M-MLV may be made to produce RTs with increased fidelity. Most preferably, a mutation at position T197 within the palm domain of the polymerase results in reverse transcriptases having increased fidelity and/or reduced misincorporation rate. In another aspect of the invention, one or more mutations at positions equivalent or corresponding to F309, T197 or Y133 may be made to produce RTs with decreased or eliminated TdT activity. In this preferred aspect, amino acid substitutions are made at one or more of the above identified positions. Thus, the amino acids at these positions may be substituted with any other amino acid including Ala, Asn, Asp, Cys, Gln, Glu, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Pro, Ser, Thr, Trp, Tyr, and Val. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The corresponding positions of M-MLV RT identified above may be readily identified for other reverse transcriptases by one with skill in the art. Thus, given the defined region and the assays described in the present application, one with skill in the art can make one or a number of modifications which would result in increased fidelity of any reverse trancriptase of interest. The following table illustrates identified regions of interest for known reverse trancriptases.

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to reverse transcriptase mutants, where the mutations or substitutions have been made in a recognized region of the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Such regions include, but are not limited to, the fingers, palm and/or thumb regions (or combinations therof). In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the mutations or substitutions are made in the thumb region, mutations in which have been shown to decrease the incidence of frame shifting. Methods for measuring the frame shifting rate are described in the examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Amino acids that may be substituted for Tyr include Lys, Arg, His, Asp, Glu, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Pro, Met, Trp, Gly, Ser, Thr, Cys, Asn or Gln. Amino acids that may be substituted for Arg include Tyr, His, Asp, Glu, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Pro, Met, Trp, Gly, Ser, Thr, Cys, Phe, Asn or Gin. Amino acids that may be substituted for Lys include Tyr, Arg, His, Asp, Glu, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Pro, Met, Trp, Gly, Ser, Thr, Cys, Asn or Gln. Amino acids that may be substituted for Glu include Lys, Arg, His, Asp, Tyr, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Pro, Met, Trp, Gly, Ser, Thr, Cys, Asn or Gln. Amino acids that may be substituted for Thr include Lys, Arg, His, Asp, Glu, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Pro, Met, Trp, Gly, Ser, Tyr, Cys, Asn or Gln. Amino acids that may be substituted for Val or include Lys, Arg, His, Asp, Glu, Ala, Tyr, Leu, lle, Pro, Met, Trp, Gly, Ser, Thr, Cys, Asn or Gln. Such mutants may be prepared by well known methods of site directed mutagenesis and as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Preferably, oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis is used to create the mutant reverse transcriptases which allows for all possible classes of base pair changes at any determined site along the encoding DNA molecule. In general, this technique involves annealing an oligonucleotide complementary (except for one or more mismatches) to a single stranded nucleotide sequence coding for the reverse trancriptase of interest. The mismatched oligonucleotide is then extended by DNA polymerase, generating a double stranded DNA molecule which contains the desired change in sequence on one strand. The changes in sequence can of course result in the deletion, substitution, or insertion of an amino acid. The double stranded polynucleotide can then be inserted into an appropriate expression vector, and a mutant polypeptide can thus be produced. The above-described oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis can of course be carried out via PCR. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Enhancing Expression of Reverse Transcriptases </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> To optimize expression of the reverse transcriptases of the present invention, inducible or constitutive promoters are well known and may be used to express high levels of a reverse transcriptase structural gene in a recombinant host. Similarly, high copy number vectors, well known in the art, may be used to achieve high levels of expression. Vectors having an inducible high copy number may also be useful to enhance expression of the reverse transcriptases of the invention in a recombinant host. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> To express the desired structural gene in a prokaryotic cell (such as, <highlight><italic>E. coli, B. subtilis, </italic></highlight>Pseudomonas, etc.), it is necessary to operably link the desired structural gene to a functional prokaryotic promoter. However, the natural promoter of the reverse transcriptase gene may function in prokaryotic hosts allowing expression of the reverse transcriptase gene. Thus, the natural promoter or other promoters may be used to express the reverse trancriptase gene. Such other promoters that may be used to enhance expression include constitutive or regulatable (i.e., inducible or derepressible) promoters. Examples of constitutive promoters include the int promoter of bacteriophage 1, and the bla promoter of the &bgr;-lactamase gene of pBR322. Examples of inducible prokaryotic promoters include the major right and left promoters of bacteriophage 1 (P<highlight><subscript>R </subscript></highlight>and P<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>), trp, recA, lacZ, lac, tet, gal, trc, and tac promoters of <highlight><italic>E. coli. </italic></highlight>The <highlight><italic>B. subtilis </italic></highlight>promoters include &agr;-amylase (Ulmanen et al, <highlight><italic>J.

Streptomyces promoters are described by Ward et al., <highlight><italic>Mol. Gen. Genet. </italic></highlight>203:468478 (1986)). Prokaryotic promoters are also reviewed by Glick, <highlight><italic>J. Ind. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>1:277-282 (1987); Cenatiempto, Y., <highlight><italic>Biochimie </italic></highlight>68:505-516 (1986); and Gottesman, <highlight><italic>Ann. Rev. Genet. </italic></highlight>18:415-442 (1984). Expression in a prokaryotic cell also requires the presence of a ribosomal binding site upstream of the gene-encoding sequence. Such ribosomal binding sites are disclosed, for example, by Gold et al., <highlight><italic>Ann. Rev. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>35:365404 (1981). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> To enhance the expression of polymerases of the invention in a eukaryotic cell, well known eukaryotic promoters and hosts may be used.

<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The enzyme(s) of the present invention is preferably produced by fermentation of the recombinant host containing and expressing the desired reverse transcriptase gene. However, the reverse transcriptase of the present invention may be isolated from any strain which produces the reverse transcriptase of the present invention. Fragments of the reverse transcriptase are also included in the present invention. Such fragments include proteolytic fragments and fragments having reverse transcriptase activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Any nutrient that can be assimilated by a host containing the cloned reverse transcriptase gene may be added to the culture medium. Optimal culture conditions should be selected case by case according to the strain used and the composition of the culture medium. Antibiotics may also be added to the growth media to insure maintenance of vector DNA containing the desired gene to be expressed. Media formulations have been described in DSM or ATCC Catalogs and Sambrook et al., In: <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning, a Laboratory Manual </italic></highlight>(2nd ed.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Recombinant host cells producing the reverse transcriptases of this invention can be separated from liquid culture, for example, by centrifugation. In general, the collected microbial cells are dispersed in a suitable buffer, and then broken down by ultrasonic treatment or by other well known procedures to allow extraction of the enzymes by the buffer solution. After removal of cell debris by ultracentrifugation or centrifugation, the reverse transcriptases can be purified by standard protein purification techniques such as extraction, precipitation, chromatography, affinity chromatography, electrophoresis or the like. Assays to detect the presence of the reverse transcriptase during purification are well known in the art and can be used during conventional biochemical purification methods to determine the presence of these enzymes. </paragraph>

One or more DNA polymerases and/or one or more nucleotides, and/or one or more primers may optionally be added to make the compositions of the invention. More preferably, the enzymes are provided at working concentrations in stable buffered salt solutions.

Such water is available commercially, for example from Sigma Chemical Company (Saint Louis, Mo.), or may be made as needed according to methods well known to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> In addition to the enzyme components, the present compositions preferably comprise one or more buffers and cofactors necessary for synthesis of a nucleic acid molecule such as a cDNA molecule. Particularly preferred buffers for use in forming the present compositions are the acetate, sulfate, hydrochloride, phosphate or free acid forms of Tris-(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS&reg;), although alternative buffers of the same approximate ionic strength and pKa as TRIS&reg; may be used with equivalent results. In addition to the buffer salts, cofactor salts such as those of potassium (preferably potassium chloride or potassium acetate) and magnesium (preferably magnesium chloride or magnesium acetate) are included in the compositions. Addition of one or more carbohydrates and/or sugars to the compositions and/or synthesis reaction mixtures may also be advantageous, to support enhanced stability of the compositions and/or reaction mixtures upon storage.

A small amount of a salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), such as disodium EDTA, may also be added (preferably about 0.1 millimolar), although inclusion of EDTA does not appear to be essential to the function or stability of the compositions of the present invention. After addition of all buffers and salts, this buffered salt solution is mixed well until all salts are dissolved, and the pH is adjusted using methods known in the art to a pH value of 7.4 to 9.2, preferably 8.0 to 9.0, and most preferably about 8.4. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> Mutagenesis. The mutants were made by oligo-directed mutagenesis as described in Kunkel, T. A. et al. <highlight><italic>Methods Enzymol. </italic></highlight>204: 125 (1991). Briefly, the Superscript II gene (an M-MLV RT gene containing point mutations in the RNase H domain, see below) was inserted into pBADhisA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) vector and named pBAD-SS II. This plasmid was transformed into DH11S cells (Life Technologies, a Division of Invitrogen Corporation, Rockville, Md.) and infected with M13K07 helper phage from which single strand DNA was isolated. Oligos were designed corresponding to each mutation: Y64W, R116M, K152R, Q190F, T197A, and V223H. 100 &mgr;M of each oligo was <highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, a Division of Invitrogen Corporation, Rockville, Md.) using the Forward Rxn Buffer (Life Technologies, a Division of Invitrogen Corporation, Rockville, Md.). The oligo was annealed to the single strand pBAD-SS II. Native T7 DNA polymerase (USB, Cleveland, Ohio) and T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, a Division of Invitrogen Corporation, Rockville, Md.) were added with synthesis buffer (0.4 mM dNTPs, 17.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 2.5 mM DTT, and 1 mM ATP) to the annealed reaction on ice. The reactions were incubated at 37&deg; C. for 30 minutes and terminated by adding 1 &mgr;l of 0.5 M EDTA (Life Technologies, a Division of Invitrogen Corporation, Rockville, Md.). The reactions were transformed and plated with DH10B cells. Colonies were picked and mutants were determined by restriction analysis and sequenced using an ABI 377 and ABI Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) for confirmation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Protein Purification of mutants. The cell pellet containing induced RT was suspended in a ratio of 2 mL Lysis buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 M KCl, 1 mM PMSF)/1 gram of cell pellet. The suspension was sonicated on ice and then centrifuged at 27000&times;g for 30 min. The cell-free extract was filtered through a 0.45&mgr; syringe filter. The cell-free extract was applied to a 5-mL Ni2&plus; HI-TRAP column (Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with 5 volumes 5 mM imidazole in Buffer A (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.1 M KCl) at 1 mL/min. The column was washed with 10 volumes 5 mM imidazole in Buffer A. The RT was eluted by washing with 20 volumes of a gradient of 5 mM to 1 M imidazole in Buffer A. The eluate containing RT protein was applied to a 1-mL Mono-S column (Pharmacia) pre-equilabrated with 10 column volumes 50 mM KCl in Buffer B (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The column was washed with 10 volumes 50 mM KCl in Buffer B. RT was eluated with 20 volumes of a gradient from 50 mM to 1 M KCl in Buffer B. The individual fractions were analyzed for RT activity. The fraction containing peak RT activity was dialyzed against Storage buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 M KCl). The isolated proteins were more than 95% pure, as judged by SDS-PAGE. The protein concentrations were determined by using the Biorad colorimetric kit with BSA as a standard. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> The lacZ&agr; assay employs the provided RT to copy lacZ&agr; RNA to cDNA. This cDNA copy, when annealed to M13, transfected, and expressed, will have either the normal wild type phenotype of a dark blue plaque, or, if the RT made a mistake while copying, it will have the mutant phenotype of a light blue or clear plaque. The mistakes could be in the form of insertions, deletions or misincorporations. Any decrease from the mutation frequency of M-MLV RNase H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> RT (SuperScript II) by the mutant RTs indicate an increase in fidelity. As shown in TABLE 2, the selected mutants demonstrate a 1.5-2.3 fold decrease in mutation frequency. The mutant V223F has a mutation frequency 2.2 fold higher than SS II and thus has lower fidelity. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Misinsertion Assays with DNA Template </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Misinsertion assay of Y64W, R116M, K152R, Q190F, T197A, V223H M-MLV RNase H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> RT with DNA template. This assay was employed to compare the misincorporation capability of the mutants to Superscript II (M-MLV RNase H<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> RT). The assay is a primer extension assay using synthetic DNA template-primer and biased dNTP pools containing only three of the four dNTPs. The reactions are displayed on a gel in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. In this assay, higher efficiency of primer extension in the absence of one dNTP denotes lower fidelity. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, in the presence of all 4 dNTPs<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>SuperScript II and all the selected mutants were able to extend the primer approximately equally, with some variance in the addition of non-template nucleotides at the end of the primer. However when incubated with biased pools of nucleotides, SS II was able to catalyze substantial extension past template nucleotides for which a complementary dNTP was missing, indicating use of incorrect nucleotides and lower fidelity. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the V223H mutant (designated as lane 2) showed shorter extension products than SS II in each of the biased pools of three dNTPs, indicating less ability to incorporate incorrect nucleotides and thus higher fidelity. This corresponds with the results of the lacZ&agr; assay where the V223H mutant had a lower mutation frequency than SS II, 21&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>versus 44&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4</superscript></highlight>, respectively. On the other hand V223F (lane 3), which had a higher mutation frequency (97&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4</superscript></highlight>) than SS II (44&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4</superscript></highlight>) in the lacZ&agr; assay, also has equal sized or longer extension products than SS II in each of the biased pools, indicating that it has a lower fidelity. These data shows a correlation between the misinsertion assay on DNA and the lacZ&agr; assay on RNA wherein higher fidelity mutants had both shorter extension products with biased pools of dNTPs and lower mutation frequencies in the lacZ&agr; assay. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> show similar results for the mutants R116M, Q190F, K152R, T197A, and Y64W, where each had shorter primer extension products than SS II in the biased nucleotide pools. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TdT Reverse Transcriptase Mutants </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> In checking fidelity mutants of reverse transcriptase (RT) for misextension in a 3 dNTP assay, it was observed that SS II RT extended 2-3 bases past the end of the template in the presence of 3 and 4 dNTPs. This non-template directed extension or TdT activity is reduced in many mutants, but in a few such as F309N and T197E it appears that this activity is severely reduced or eliminated. These mutants are probably in close proximity or in contact with the template-primer as determined by homology to HIV reverse transcriptase and its crystal structure with bound template-primer. </paragraph>

The primers encoded a random NNK sequence for this position generating a random library of F309 mutants, where N is any of the four bases and K is T or G. The primers along with internal SS II RT primers at an upstream SstI restriction site and a downstream SalI restriction site were used in a standard PCR reaction (10 ng SS II RT template, 2 &mgr;M of each primer, 48 &mgr;I Supermix (Life Technologies, a division of Invitrogen Corporation) for 20 cycles of 94&deg; C. 15 sec, 55&deg; C. 15 sec, 72&deg; C. 30 sec) to generate two PCR fragments. These were a 240 bp SstI-NgoMIV fragment and a 200 bp NgoMIV-SalI fragment. The fragments were isolated and digested and ligated together and then inserted into the original SS II RT clone cut with SstI and SalI. The resulting ligation product was transformed in Max Efficiency DH10B (Life Technologies, a division of Invitrogen Corporation) competent cells to create the library of mutants at site F309. This library was then plated overnight for selection. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The mutants T197E and Y133A were made by oligo-directed mutagenesis as described in Kunkel, T. A. et al. <highlight><italic>Methods Enzymol. </italic></highlight>204. 125 (1991). Briefly, the SuperScript II RT gene was inserted into pBADhisA (Invitrogen Corporation) vector and named pBAD-SSII. This plasmid was transformed into DH11S cells and the cells were infected with M13K07 helper phage from which single strand DNA was isolated. Oligos were designed corresponding to each mutation: T197E and Y133A. Each oligo (100 &mgr;M) was kinased with T4 DNA kinase (Life Technologies, a division of Invitrogen Corporation) using the Forward Rxn Buffer (Life Technologies, a division of Invitrogen Corporation).

It is preferable to first inoculate a 96 well plate with selective medium without the inducer, to grow that master plate overnight, and then to make a replica of the master plate into a 96-well plate with the inducer and grow that plate overnight. The cultures were grown overnight at 37&deg; C. without shaking. Overnight cultures were mixed with an equal volume of 2&times; PLD (1.8% glucose, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM EDTA, 20 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mg/mL lysozyme) at room temperature. These extracts were assayed directly for RT activity by mixing 10 &mgr;l of the extract with 40 &mgr;l of 1.25&times; RT reaction mix (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 62.5 mM KCl, 12.5 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 12.5 mM DTT, 1.25 mM dGTP, polyC/oligo dG (3.75 mM/1.5 mM in nucleotide), &lsqb;<highlight><superscript>32</superscript></highlight>P&rsqb; dGTP). This reaction was placed in a 37&deg; C. water bath for 10 min. A small aliquot of the reaction mixture (5 &mgr;l) was spotted onto a charged nylon membrane (Genescreen&plus;, NEN). The membrane was washed twice with 10%TCA&plus;1% sodium pyrophosphate, rinsed with ethanol, dried, and placed next to a phosphor screen. Radioactive product that had been trapped on the filter was detected by analyzing the screen in a Phosphorimager, using ImageQuant software (Molecular Devices). Candidates were selected if they showed RT activity (radioactivity). These candidates were screened a second time to confirm the phenotype. The confirmed candidates were then sequenced to determine which amino acids maintained detectable RT activity. </paragraph>

The purified RTs were more than 95% pure, as judged by SDS-PAGE. The protein concentrations were determined by using the Biorad calorimetric kit. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> We carried out a misinsertion assay of F309N (H204R, T306K) SuperScript II RT, hereafter referred to as F309N, with DNA template. This assay was employed to compare the misincorporation capability of the mutant to Superscript II. The assay is a primer extension assay using synthetic DNA template-primer and biased dNTP pools containing only three of four dNTPs. The reactions are displayed on a gel in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. While conducting this procedure to screen for mutants with lower misensertion/misextension rates it was observed that SS II RT extended 2-3 nucleotides past the template end and that some mutations reduced or appeared to eliminate this non-template directed extension or TdT activity. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in the presence of all 4 dNTPs, SuperScript II RT and the mutant F309N were able to extend the primer approximately equally, with SS II RT adding 2 nucleotides past the template, and F309N adding none beyond the end of the template. To further evaluate this non-templated directed extension the control reaction for the 3 dNTP misextension assay containing all 4 dNTPs was carried out with SS II, F309N, T197E, and Y133A RT for 30 minutes with varying amounts of enzyme. The three mutants had shown very reduced levels of TdT activity in prior screens. Since it had been observed that 5 minutes with 20 units of enzyme was more than enough time for the primer extension to be completed, a 30 minute incubation and 200 to 646 units of RT were both in large excess over what was necessary for the reaction to be completed. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, all the RT reactions at the lowest amount tested had similar extension products to the reactions at the highest unit concentrations demonstrating that the reaction had gone to completion. SS II RT added 2 nucleotides past the end of the template, F309N and T197E did not extend past the end of the template, and Y133A appears to have a small amount of product that is 1 nucleotide past the end of the template. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> The F309 amino acid position in M-MLV reverse transcriptase (RT) aligns with the W266 position in HIV reverse transcriptase. This position is at the base of the thumb domain and is considered part of the minor groove binding tract which interacts with the minor groove of the template-primer. The mutations H204R and T306K have been shown to increase the thermostability of the enzyme. These mutations are described in U.S. Application No. 60/207,197, filed May 26, 2000, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The F309N mutation in an H204R/T306K clone displays 2.3&times; lower mutation frequency in a lacZ forward assay (Table 3) on RNA template and shorter extension products in a 3 dNTP extension assay than SuperScript II RT or H204R/T306K in SuperScript II RT. Both findings support the claim of an enzyme with higher fidelity (Table 4).

<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> Sequencing of plaques. The plaques from the lacZ forward assay were transferred from the soft agar plate to Whatmann 3MM paper and allowed to dry for at least 1 hour. The plaque was then punched out and the plaque/paper disk was added directly to a sequencing reaction mix containing 4-8 &mgr;l ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction (Perkin Elmer) 1 &mgr;l primer (GAAGATCGCACTCCAGCCAGC) (SEQ ID NO: 3) and distilled water to 20 &mgr;l total volume. The ABI cycle sequencing protocol was used for 96&deg; C. 10 seconds, 50&deg; C. 5 seconds, 60&deg; C. 4 minutes for 25 cycles. The paper disks were removed and the reactions were precipitated, then resuspended in loading dye and run on an ABI 377 sequencing machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> The sequences were compared to wild type lacZ alpha sequence and then classified as frame shift (either 1 nucleotide insertion or deletion), mismatch, or strand jump (an insertion or deletion between repeated sequences). The overall error rate for each class was determined by dividing the mutation frequency by the number of detectable sites (i.e., sites the alteration of which results in a phenotypic change) (116) multiplied by 0.5 (to exclude the original single strand contribution) and then multiplied by the percentage of mutants observed to be in each class.

<heading lvl="1">Results </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> We carried out a misinsertion assay of F309N (H204R T306K) SuperScript reverse transcriptase, hereafter referred to as F309N, and V223H F309N (H204R T306K), hereafter referred to as V223H/F309N with DNA template. This assay was employed to compare the misincorporation capability of the mutant to SuperScript II. The assay is a primer extension assay using synthetic DNA template-primer and biased dNTP pools containing only three of the four dNTPs. The reactions are displayed on a gel in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. In this assay, higher efficiency of primer extension denotes lower fidelity. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, in the presence of all 4 dNTPs, SuperScript II RT and the mutants F309N and V223H/F309N were able to extend the primer approximately equally, with some variance in the addition of non-template directed nucleotides at the end of the primer. However when incubated with biased pools of nucleotides, SuperScript II RT was able to catalyze substantial extension past template nucleotides for which a complementary dNTP was missing, indicating use of incorrect nucleotides and lower fidelity. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the F309N (2) mutant showed shorter extension products than SS II RT in each of the biased pools of three dNTPs, indicating less ability to incorporate incorrect nucleotides and thus higher fidelity. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the V223H/F309N mutant was extended with just the dATP and dCTP pools. In each case V223H/F309N also had lower extension products than SuperScript II. This corresponds with the results of the lacZ&agr; assay where the F309N and V223H/F309N mutants had a lower mutation frequency than SS II RT (17&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>and 14&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>to 39&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4</superscript></highlight>). The RT with just the H204R T306K mutations without F309N has a mutation frequency similar to SS II RT (41&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4 </superscript></highlight>to 39&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;4</superscript></highlight>), suggesting that these muations do not influence fidelity. This data shows a correlation between the misinsertion assay on DNA and the lacZa assay on RNA wherein higher fidelity mutants had both shorter extension products with biased pools of dNTPs and lower mutation frequencies in the lacZa assay. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> To determine Error Rates, mutant plaques from the lacZ forward assay were sequenced using known methods. The mutations were then classified into one of the following categories: mismatches for misinsertion events, frameshifts for single insertion or deletion events, or jumps for large insertions or deletions caused by jumping between similar sequences. An overall Error Rate was then determined for nucleic acid encoding the lacZ alpha peptide using the following equation:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>ER (error rate)&equals;MF (mutation frequency)/(number of detectable sites&times;0.5), where the number of detectable sites is 116.</in-line-formula></paragraph>
