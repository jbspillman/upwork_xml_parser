<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of communication systems, and more particularly to a system and method operable to facilitate wide band optical amplification while maintaining acceptable noise figures. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Because of the increase in data intensive applications, the demand for bandwidth in communications has been growing tremendously. In response, the installed capacity of telecommunication systems has been increasing by an order of magnitude every three to four years since the mid 1970s. Much of this capacity increase has been supplied by optical fibers that provide a four-order-of-magnitude bandwidth enhancement over twisted-pair copper wires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To exploit the bandwidth of optical fibers, two key technologies have been developed and used in the telecommunication industry: optical amplifiers and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). Optical amplifiers boost the signal strength and compensate for inherent fiber loss and other splitting and insertion losses. WDM enables different wavelengths of light to carry different signals in parallel over the same optical fiber. Although WDM is critical in that it allows utilization of a major fraction of the fiber bandwidth, it would not be cost-effective without optical amplifiers. In particular, broadband optical amplifier systems that permit simultaneous amplification of many WDM channels are a key enabler for utilizing the full fiber bandwidth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Traditionally, amplification of signals having a broad range of wavelengths has required separating the signals into subsets of wavelengths, and amplifying each subset with a separate amplifier. This approach can be complex and expensive. Using separate amplifiers for each subset requires additional hardware, additional laser pumps for each amplifier, and additional power to launch the additional pumps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Although a more efficient approach would be to amplify the entire signal using a single amplifier for at least some amplifiers in the system, unfortunately, no acceptable single amplifier approach has been developed. For example, erbium doped-amplifiers are an inherently bad choice for wide band amplification if the ultimate goal is to provide an amplifier that can operate over the entire telecommunications spectrum. For example, for wavelengths shorter than about 1525 nanometers, erbium-atoms in typical glasses will absorb more than they amplify. Even with use of various dopings, such as, aluminum or phosphorus, the absorption peak for the various glasses is still around 1530 nanometers. This leaves a large gap in the short communications band (S-Band) unreachable by erbium doped fiber amplifiers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Raman amplifiers provide a better solution in terms of broadband amplification potential, but conventional Raman amplifiers have suffered from other shortcomings. For example, Raman amplifiers have traditionally suffered from high noise figures when used in wide band applications. In addition, Raman amplifiers suffer from gain tilt introduced when longer wavelength signals rob energy from shorter wavelength signals. This effect becomes increasingly pronounced as amplifier launch power and system bandwidth increases. Wide band Raman amplifiers operating at high launch powers on a wide range of wavelengths can be particularly vulnerable to this effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Masuda, et al. (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,803 B1 and related research papers) have attempted to improve the bandwidth of erbium doped amplifiers by cascading with the erbium doped amplifier a Raman amplifier with an approximately complementary gain profile. Masuda, et al, however, consistently require the presence of an erbium doped amplifier (which relies on different physics for amplification and does not suffer from the same noise problems as Raman amplifiers do) to provide virtually all amplification to signal wavelengths close in spectrum to the pump wavelengths. Indeed, Masuda, et al. concede that the noise figures they report ignore the effect of the Raman portion of their amplifier. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the invention, a multi-stage Raman amplifier comprises a plurality of cascaded Raman amplifier stages, at least some of the Raman stages having sloped gain profiles operable to contribute to a combined gain profile of the amplifier. The combined gain profile of the amplifier is approximately flat across a bandwidth of at least eighty nanometers and comprises a small signal noise figure no greater than eight decibels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the invention, a method of amplifying an optical signal having multiple wavelengths comprises amplifying a plurality of signal wavelengths at a first Raman amplifier stage having a first sloped gain profile, and amplifying at least most of the plurality of signal wavelengths at a second Raman amplifier stage having a second sloped gain profile that is different than the first sloped gain profile.

In this embodiment, the gain profiles of the first and second Raman stages are operable to combine to contribute to an approximately flat combined gain profile over the plurality of signal wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In still another aspect of the invention, an optical booster amplifier operable to be coupled to an optical communication link carrying optical signals having a plurality of wavelengths comprises a first Raman stage having a gain profile where a majority of longer signal wavelengths are amplified more than a majority of shorter signal wavelengths. The booster amplifier also comprises a second Raman stage operable to receive at least most of the signal wavelengths after they have been amplified by the first stage, the second stage having a gain profile where a majority of shorter signal wavelengths are amplified more than a majority of longer signal wavelengths.

The booster amplifier comprises a first Raman stage having a gain profile wherein a majority of longer wavelengths are amplified more than a majority of shorter wavelengths, and a second Raman stage having a gain profile approximately complementary to the first gain stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the invention, an optical communication system operable to facilitate communication of multiple signal wavelengths comprises a transmitter bank operable to generate a plurality of signal wavelengths, and a multiplexer operable to combine the plurality of signal wavelengths into a single multiple wavelength signal for transmission over a transmission medium. The system further comprises an amplifier coupled to the transmission medium and operable to amplify the multiple wavelength signal prior to, during, or after the multiple wavelength signal&apos;s transmission over the transmission medium, the amplifier comprising a multi-stage Raman amplifier. The amplifier includes a first Raman amplifier stage having a first sloped gain profile operable to amplify a plurality of signal wavelengths and a second Raman amplifier stage having a second sloped gain profile operable to amplify at least most of the plurality of signal wavelengths after those wavelengths have been amplified by the first stage. The second sloped gain profile has an approximately complementary slope to the slope of the first sloped gain profile, and the combined effect of the first and second Raman stages contributes to an approximately flat overall gain profile over the plurality of signal wavelengths. In one embodiment, the system further includes a demultiplexer operable to receive the multiple wavelength signal and to separate the signal wavelengths from the multiple wavelength signal, and a receiver bank operable to receive the plurality of signal wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Depending on the specific features implemented, particular embodiments of the present invention may exhibit some, none, or all of the following technical advantages. For example, one aspect of the invention facilitates optical amplification of a wide bandwidth of wavelengths while maintaining an approximately flat gain profile and an acceptable noise figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In a particular embodiment, one aspect of the invention reduces the noise figure associated with the amplifier by amplifying in a first Raman stage a majority of shorter wavelengths more than a majority of longer wavelengths. In this way, shorter wavelengths (which are often closest to the pump wavelength) are amplified to overcome any effects that might be caused by phonon-stimulated noise. As a further enhancement, the amplifier could be designed so that the longest pump wavelength is at least ten nanometers below the shortest signal being amplified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In addition to yielding an acceptable noise figure, this approach can produce an approximately flat gain tilt, for example, by cascading a second Raman amplifier stage having a gain profile that amplifies a majority of longer wavelengths more than a majority of shorter wavelengths. In a particular embodiment, the second gain profile can be approximately complementary to the first gain profile. In some applications, the second gain profile can have an approximately equal (although opposite) slope from the first gain profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention results in increased efficiency in a multi-stage Raman amplifier. This aspect of the invention involves applying, in at least one Raman stage, a first gain profile that amplifies a majority of longer wavelengths more than a majority of shorter wavelengths; and applying, in a later cascaded Raman stage, a second gain profile that amplifies a majority of shorter wavelengths more than a majority of longer wavelengths. This embodiment facilitates allowing longer pump wavelengths in the first stage to accept energy from shorter pump wavelengths in the later Raman stage. This effect, in turn, facilitates using smaller pump wavelengths and/or fewer pump wavelengths in the first stage than would otherwise be required, thereby increasing the efficiency of the device. In a particular embodiment, the gain profiles of the first and later Raman stages can be approximately complimentary, contributing to an approximately flat overall gain profile for the amplifier. The noise figure can be reduced, for example, by performing a majority of the amplification of wavelengths closest to the pump wavelengths in one of the final amplifier stages, or in the last amplifier stage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Other aspects of the invention facilitate cascading multiple amplifier stages to realize advantages of low noise and high efficiency in a multiple stage Raman amplifier. Moreover, cascaded stages can provide mid-stage access to the amplifier to facilitate, for example, optical add/drop multiplexing of WDM signals while maintaining an acceptable noise figure and an approximately flat gain profile, both at the mid-stage access point and across the entire amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Other technical advantages are readily apparent to one of skill in the art from the attached figures, description, and claims. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> At least one amplifier in system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a wide band multi-stage Raman amplifier operable to receive a wide bandwidth of wavelength signal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In a particular embodiment, the amplifier can process over 80 nanometers of bandwidth, and in some cases over 100 nanometers of bandwidth while maintaining an approximately flat gain profile over the bandwidth of amplified signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Throughout this document, the term &ldquo;approximately flat&rdquo; describes a condition where the maximum signal gain differs from the minimum signal gain by an no more than amount suitable for use in telecommunication systems. The deviation between minimum and maximum signal gains may comprise, for example five decibels prior to application of any gain flattening filters. Particular embodiments of the invention may achieve gain flatness of approximately three decibels prior to application of any gain flattening filters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Some amplifiers in system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could comprise a plurality of individual amplifiers working in conjunction, each amplifying a subset of the bandwidth processed by the single wide band amplifier. Alternatively, all amplifiers in system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could comprises wide bandwidth amplifiers. Depending on the overall bandwidth communicated by system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, one or more amplifier locations in system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could comprise a plurality of wide band amplifiers operating in conjunction to handle a total bandwidth significantly in excess of 100 nanometers. In other cases, a single wide band amplifier could process all traffic at a given location in system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Wide band amplifiers within system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprise multi-stage Raman amplifiers having at least two stages with approximately complimentary gain profiles. A combination of the complimentary gain profiles, in cooperation with any other gain stages in the wide band amplifier, results in approximately flat gain profile for the amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Throughout this description, the phrase &ldquo;approximately complementary&rdquo; refers to a situation where, at least in general, signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that are highly amplified in the first stage are less amplified in the second stage, and signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that are highly amplified in the second stage are less amplified in the first stage. Two gain profiles said to be &ldquo;approximately complementary&rdquo; need not have equal and opposite slopes. Moreover, equal amplification of any particular wavelengths in both gain profiles does preclude those gain profiles from being &ldquo;approximately complementary.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Conventional designs of multi-stage Raman amplifiers have been unable to process bandwidths in excess of 80 nanometers while maintaining approximately flat gain profiles and acceptable noise figures. One aspect of this invention recognizes that a major culprit in noise figures associated with conventional multi-stage Raman amplifiers is the phonon-stimulated optical noise created when wavelength signals being amplified reside spectrally close to pump wavelengths used for amplification. One aspect of the invention reduces adverse effect of this noise by enhancing the Raman amplification at of signal wavelengths near the pump wavelengths to overcome the effects of the noise, and applying an approximately complementary Raman gain profile in another stage to result in an approximately flat overall gain profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> graphically illustrates the phonon-stimulated optical noise figure increase as the spectral spacing between signal wavelengths and pump wavelengths decreases. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, phonon-stimulated noise increases dramatically as signal wavelength get close to the pump wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the invention significantly reduces adverse effects associated with phonon-stimulated noise by providing multiple stages of Raman gain having approximately complimentary gain profiles acting on substantially the same bandwidth of signals. While best results are obtained by applying approximately complimentary gain profiles to all or nearly all of the same signal wavelengths, some portion of wavelengths can be omitted from one gain profile and included in the other gain profile without departing from the scope of this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a block diagram of an exemplary embodiment of a multiple stage Raman amplifier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> including gain profiles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> associated with various amplification stages and an overall gain profile <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for the amplifier. In this example, amplifier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a two-stage amplifier having a first stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and a second stage <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> cascaded with first stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. As will be further discussed below, the invention is not limited to a particular number of amplifier stages. For example, additional amplification stages could be cascaded onto second stage <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Moreover, although the illustrated embodiment shows second stage <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> cascaded directly to first stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, additional amplification stages could reside between first stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and second stage <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Amplifier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> could comprise a distributed Raman amplifier, a discrete Raman amplifier, or a hybrid Raman amplifier which comprises both discrete and distributed stages. Each stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of amplifier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an input operable to receive a multiple wavelength optical input signal <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. As a particular example, optical input signal <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> could include wavelengths ranging over one hundred nanometers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Each stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> also includes distributed gain media <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Depending on the type of amplifier being implemented, media <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> may comprise, for example a transmission fiber, or a gain fiber such as a spooled gain fiber. In a particular embodiment, media <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> may comprise a dispersion compensating fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Each stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> further includes one or more wavelength pumps <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Pumps <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> generate pump light <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> at specified wavelengths, which are pumped into distributed gain media <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Raman gain results from the interaction of intense light from the pumps with optical phonons in silica fibers. The Raman effect leads to a transfer of energy from one optical beam (the pump) to another optical beam (the signal). Pumps <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> may comprise, for example, one or more laser diodes. Although the illustrated embodiment shows the use of counter propagating pumps, under some circumstances using a relatively quiet pump, co-propagating pumps could also be used without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In one particular embodiment, pump wavelengths <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> can be selected so that the longest wavelength pump signal <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> has a wavelength that is shorter than the shortest wavelength of signal <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. As one specific example, the longest wavelength of pump light <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> could be selected to be, for example, at least ten nanometers shorter than the shortest wavelength of signal <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In this manner, amplifier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can help to avoid phonon stimulated noise that otherwise occurs when pump wavelengths interact with wavelengths of the amplified signal. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The number of pump wavelengths <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, their launch powers, their spectral and spatial positions with respect to other pump wavelengths and other wavelength signals, and the bandwidth and power level of the signal being amplified can all contribute to the shape of the gain profile for the respective amplifier stage. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows exemplary gain profiles for first stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and second stage <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>.

Each of gain profiles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> reflects the effects of the other gain profile acting upon it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In this example, gain profile <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of first stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has a downward slope, where a majority of the shorter signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are amplified more than a majority of the longer signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Conversely, gain profile <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of second stage <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is approximately complimentary to gain profile <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of first stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Gain profile <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> exhibits an upward slope where a majority of the longer signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are amplified more than a majority of the shorter signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Gain profile <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (shown in dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) represents an exemplary composite gain profile of amplifier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> resulting from the application of gain profiles <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to optical signal <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Gain profile <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is approximately flat over at least substantially all of the bandwidth of wavelengths within signal <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In operation, amplifier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> receives optical input signal <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> at distributive gain medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of first stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Distributed gain medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> could comprise, for example, a dispersion compensating Raman gain fiber, a transmission fiber, a high non-linearly fiber, a segment of transmission fiber, or combination thereof. Pumps <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) generate pump wavelengths <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and apply them to distributed gain medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> through coupler <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). Pump wavelengths <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> interact with signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, transferring energy from the pump wavelengths <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to the signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In this example, shorter signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are amplified more than longer signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in first stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Amplified wavelengths of signal <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are communicated to distributed gain medium <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of second stage <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Wavelengths of signal <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are amplified in second stage <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> by interacting with pump wavelengths <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>generated at pumps <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The combined effect of amplification in first stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and second stage <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of amplifier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> results in approximately flat gain profile <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> across wavelengths of optical signal <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. This particular example provides a significant advantage in reducing the noise figure associated with the amplifier. Using this configuration, the small signal noise figure of amplifier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be reduced to less than eight decibels, in some cases 7 decibels, even where the bandwidth of signal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> exceeds 100 nanometers. </paragraph>

Each amplifier stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> operates to amplify wavelengths of signal <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> according to gain profiles <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> as shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> differs from the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in that gain profile <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of first stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> exhibits an upward slope where a majority of longer wavelengths of signal <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are amplified more than the majority of shorter wavelengths of signal <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Conversely, gain profile <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of second stage <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> comprises an approximately complementary gain profile to first gain profile <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of first stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. In profile <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> applies a higher gain to a majority of shorter wavelengths than the gain applied to the majority of longer signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In addition, in this embodiment, the launch power of pumps <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>driving first gain profile <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> This aspect of the invention recognizes that due to the Raman scattering effect, longer wavelength signals tend to rob energy from shorter wavelength signals. This aspect of the invention leverages that fact to allow the longer pump wavelengths of wavelengths <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to rob energy from the shorter pump wavelengths of wavelengths <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In a particular embodiment, amplifier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may include a shunt <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> between second distributed gain medium <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and first distributed gain medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to facilitate the longer pump wavelengths of wavelengths <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>accepting power from the shorter pump wavelengths of wavelengths <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The effects result in an overall gain profile <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for first stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> that remains approximately complimentary to the gain profile of second stage <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. As a result, the composite gain profile <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) of the amplifier remains approximately flat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> This embodiment provides significant advantages in terms of efficiency by allowing the use of fewer wavelength pumps <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the first stage <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and/or also by allowing each pump <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to operate at a lower launch power. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In operation, amplifier <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> receives signal <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> at first stage <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and applies a gain to signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> according to gain profile <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Signal <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> next traverses second stage <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> where gain profile <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is applied. Finally, signal <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is amplified by third stage <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> according to gain profile <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Signal <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> exits amplifier <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> at output <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> having been exposed to a composite gain profile <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In this particular example, first stage <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and second stage <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> operate in a similar manner to amplifier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In particular, first stage <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> applies a gain profile <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> that amplifies a majority of shorter signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> more than it amplifies a majority of longer signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. Second stage <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, conversely, applies and approximately complimentary gain profile <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to signal <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, where the majority of longer wavelengths of signal <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> are amplified more than a majority of shorter wavelengths of signal <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The combination of second stage <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and third stage <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, operates similarly to amplifier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. While second stage <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> applies gain profile <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> amplifying a majority of longer signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> more than a majority of shorter signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, third stage <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> applies to gain profile <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight>, which amplifies a majority of shorter signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> more than a majority of longer signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. In this particular example, gain profile <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of second stage <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is approximately complimentary to both gain profile <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of first stage <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and gain profile <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> of third stage <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. In this example, the slope of gain profile <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is significantly steeper than the slope of gain profiles <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> to account for the fact that gain profile <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is the only profile exhibiting an upward slope. The composite gain profile <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) resulting from the combination of amplifications in first, second, and third amplifier stages of amplifier <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> results in an approximately flat gain profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> This particular example reaps the efficiency benefits discussed with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and permits use of the noise figure reduction techniques discussed with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. For example, efficiency advantages are realized by allowing longer pump wavelengths <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> of second stage <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to accept power from high powered shorter pump wavelengths <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of third amplification stage <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. This results from the Raman effect wherein longer wavelength signals tend to rob energy from shorter wavelength signals. As a result, second stage <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> can be operated with fewer wavelength pumps than what otherwise be required, and also with lower pump launch powers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In terms of improvements in noise figure, the gain profiles of first stage <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> compared to second stage <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> results in high amplification of shorter wavelengths of signal <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> to overcome phonon stimulated noise associated with interaction of those signals with the longer pump wavelengths <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In addition, providing a significant amount of amplification to shorter wavelengths of signal <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> in the last stage <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> of amplifier <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> helps to minimize the noise figure associated with amplifier <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>show a block diagram of a four stage Raman amplifier, gain profiles associated with various stages of the amplifier, and a composite gain of the amplifier respectively. Amplifier <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is similar in structure and function to amplifiers <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, respectively. In this example, amplifier <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes four Raman amplification stages <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>. Each amplification stage includes a distributed gain medium <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, respectively. Distributed gain medium <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> of first stage <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> may comprise, for example, a transmission fiber or a Raman gain fiber. Each of distributed gain medium <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> of second, third, and fourth stages <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> may comprise a Raman gain fiber or a segment of transmission fiber. In particular embodiments, some or all of distributed gain media <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> could comprise dispersion compensating Raman gain fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Each distributed gain medium <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> is operable to receive a multi wavelength optical signal <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and amplify that signal by facilitating interaction between optical signal <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and pump wavelengths <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. Pump wavelengths <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are generated by pumps <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and coupled to distributed gain media <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> through couplers <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. In this particular example, couplers <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> comprise wave division multiplexers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, amplifier <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes at least one lossy element <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> coupled between amplifier stages. In this example, lossy element <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>comprises an optical add/drop multiplexer coupled between second stage <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and third stage <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. Optical add/drop multiplexer <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>facilitates mid-stage access to amplifier <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and allows selective addition and/or deletion of particular wavelengths from signal <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. Other lossy elements, such as isolators or gain equalizers could alternatively reside between amplifier stages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In operation, signal <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> enters amplifier <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> at coupler <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which passes signal <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to first amplifier stage <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> where a gain profile at <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, is applied to wavelengths of signal <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. Signal <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is then passed to second stage <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> where a gain profile <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is applied to wavelengths of signal <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In this particular example, first and second stages <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> of amplifier <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> operate similarly to amplifier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In particular, first stage <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> applies a gain profile where a majority of shorter signal wavelengths are amplified more than a majority of longer signal wavelengths, and second stage <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> applies an approximately complimentary gain profile <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> where a majority of longer signal wavelengths are amplified more than a majority of shorter signal wavelengths. In this particular embodiment, the composite gain from first stage <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and second stage <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> results in an approximately flat gain profile at the output of second stage <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. This design advantageously facilitates addition and subtraction of particular wavelengths of signal <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> without the need for further manipulation of the gain. In addition, first and second gain stages <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> provide a low noise figure, reducing the effects of phonon stimulated noise in shorter wavelength signals closest to the pump wavelengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Continuing with the operational description, particular wavelengths of signal <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> may be substituted with other wavelengths at add/drop multiplexer <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. After processing by add/drop multiplexer <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, signal <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> continues to third amplification stage <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, where gain profile <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is applied as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Signal <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is then communicated to fourth stage <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> where gain profile <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> is applied to wavelengths of signal <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. Amplified signal <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is then output at output port <highlight><bold>365</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Third and fourth amplification stages of amplifier <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> are similar in structure and function to amplifier <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Through the use of this configuration, third and fourth amplifier stages <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> provide increased efficiency in operation. In particular, pump <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> can operate with fewer pump signals and/or lower launch power as a result of the Raman scattering effect which allows longer pump wavelengths <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of third stage <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to accept power from highly amplified shorter pump wavelengths <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>of fourth stage <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>. Moreover, third and fourth amplification stages <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> assist in maintaining a low noise figure by applying a significant amount of the gain to the shortest wavelengths of signal <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> at the last amplifier stage <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a flow chart showing one example of a method <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of amplifying a multi-wavelength optical signal using a multi-stage Raman amplifier. This particular example uses <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to illustrate the method. Similar methods could apply to any of the embodiments described herein. Method <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> begins at step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> where first amplifier stage <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> receives signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and applies first gain profile <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to those wavelengths. Step <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> allows for optional mid-stage access between first stage <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and second stage <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. The method continues where second stage <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> applies second gain profile <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> to signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> at step <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Second gain profile <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> is approximately complimentary to first gain profile <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. In this particular example, first gain profile <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> amplifies a majority of shorter signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> more than a majority of longer signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, while second gain profile <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> amplifies a majority of longer wavelength signals <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> more than a majority of shorter wavelength signals <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. Those gain profiles could be reversed if desired. Moreover, additional gain profiles could be applied between first stage <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and second stage <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> by intervening stages (not explicitly shown). This particular example shows additional stages beyond first stage <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and second stage <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. In a particular embodiment, an amplifier embodying the invention could comprise only two complimentary stages of Raman gain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> This example provides optional mid-stage access at step <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. Mid-stage access could comprise, for example, application of optical add/drop multiplexing, gain equalization, or the presence of one or more optical isolators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Where amplifier <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> comprises more than two stages of complimentary Raman amplification, method <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> continues at step <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> where third stage <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> applies gain profile <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> to signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. Where amplifier <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> comprises a three stage amplifier, third gain profile <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> can be complimentary to second gain profile <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. An example of this operation is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Where amplifier <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> comprises a four stage amplifier, third stage <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> can apply gain profile at <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, while fourth stage <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> applies gain profile <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at step <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In this example, third gain profile <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> amplifies a majority of longer signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> more than a majority of shorter signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> while fourth stage <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> amplifies a majority of shorter signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> more than a majority of longer signal wavelengths <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. In this manner, third and fourth stages of amplifier <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can realize efficiency advantages by allowing longer pump wavelengths <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>from third stage <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> to accept energy from highly amplified shorter pump wavelengths <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>in fourth stage <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Although this method has described a four stage amplification process, the method can equally apply to any system having two or more Raman amplification stages. In addition, although this particular example described first and second gain stages having gain profiles <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and third and fourth gain stages having gain profiles <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, those gain profiles could be reversed without departing from the scope of the invention. The particular example shown provides significant advantages in a four stage amplifier in that initial stages can be configured to provide a low noise figure by emphasizing amplification of shorter wavelength signals early in the amplification process. In addition, third and fourth amplification stages advantageously realize efficiency gains in amplifier locations where noise reduction is not as critical a concern. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> An optical amplifier noise figure is defined as NF&equals;SNRin/SNRout where SNRin is the signal-to-noise ratio of the amplifier input signal and SNRout is the signal-to-noise ratio of the amplifier output signal. As defined, NF is always greater then 1 for any realizable amplifier. Effective noise figure for a distributed optical amplifier is defined as the noise figure a discrete amplifier placed at the end of the distributed amplifier transmission fiber would need to have to produce the same final SNR as the distributed amplifier. It can be, and in practice is, less than 1 (negative value in dB) for practical distributed amplifiers over at least a small portion of their operating wavelength range. </paragraph>
