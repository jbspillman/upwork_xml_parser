<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The Title III Digital Recording System is an invention to satisfy the digital recording requirements of court ordered wiretapping in accordance with newly generated legislation (CALEA, the Communication Assistance for Law Enforcement Act), and to replace inefficient Title III analog recording techniques with digital recording. Title III refers to a generally accepted reference for legal wiretapping (telephone intercepts). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Title 18 U.S. Code actually defines current wiretapping regulations; however, the use of &ldquo;Title III&rdquo; is prevalent within the Law Enforcement community when describing these activities and regulations. Numerous constraints, not satisfied by available digital recording devices, are levied on the law enforcement professional in carrying out the mandates of Title 18. These include the requirements for multiple simultaneous recordings; the ability to &ldquo;minimize&rdquo;, or briefly terminate monitoring of the wiretap, during periods of non-relevant conversation; and various other minor requirements for record-keeping and data integrity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The Title III Digital Recording System was co-invented by: </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">5.0 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The Title III Digital Recording System field of endeavor is electronics surveillance instruments used by local state, and federal Law Enforcement Agencies. The Title III Digital Recording System uniquely applies conventional CD recording techniques to specific Law Enforcement problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Reference documents include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A. U.S. Code Title 18, sections 2510 et al, which describes the requirements for legal wiretapping activities; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> B. Communication Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, J-STD-025), which describes newly formed specifications for access to digital telephony systems for the purpose of legal wiretapping activities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The advent of digital technology provides problems for the legal intercept of telephony. These problems consist of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A. Current telephony intercept systems generally accept analog input signals. Technology, and CALEA, now suggest that received telephony may be in digital form. The digital nature of the access precludes the use of conventional and current telephony equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> B. Current telephony intercept equipment generally operates in a monophonic mode; i.e., a single channel of telephony is recorded in analog fashion. In current two wire systems, this is satisfactory since both sides of a conversation (target and target&apos;s associate) are contained in the single channel. This is not necessarily true with the newer technologies, whereby the target and the associate may be on individual analog or digital lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> C. Facsimile intercepts are very important to Law Enforcement agencies. However, current analog recording systems do not allow the fidelity required for post-processing and generation of intercepted facsimile data from conventional analog tapes normally used by Law Enforcement agencies. Because of this, expensive facsimile intercept systems must be individually allocated to each intercept (very expensive and resource inefficient), rather than using a single facsimile intercept system for use on collected data from a number of different target intercepts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> D. Record time for current analog recorders is very limited. For example, current analog recording systems generally use audiocassette tapes limited to one-hour record times (maximum). The problem is exacerbated by Title 18 requirements, which call for both a primary and backup recording. The frequent changing of audio analog tapes results in periodic &ldquo;missed&rdquo; intercepts and bookkeeping/accounting difficulties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> E. Intercepted conversations, recorded on analog tapes, are transcribed to paper format via transcription specialists. The transcription process for analog tape recordings is cumbersome, due to the slow forward/reverse control of the analog tape machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> F. Dubbing of analog media, required, for example, in legal discovery situations, is cumbersome and time consuming when using analog media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> G. With current recording systems, it is very difficult to mark events of interest. For example, current procedures call for an event of interest (segment of tape recording with evidentiary content, beginning of a critical conversation, etc) to be marked by the operator via written format, with the time recorded. No direct correlation of the event occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> H. Current Law Enforcement analog recording techniques do not allow network control of resources from a single point. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">6.0 BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The Title III Digital Recording System is a recorder compliant with the requirements set forth in the U.S. Code Title 18, sections 2510 et al. It provides a complete capability to support legally authorized wiretaps, and provides many features to assist the Law Enforcement professional in conducting the wiretap recording operation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The Title III Digital Recording System allows the Law Enforcement professional to record high-fidelity intercepts on digital recording media, vs. analog tape recordings. It provides for 20 hours of recording on a single Compact Disc (CD) media. The recording technique utilizes UDF (Universal Data Formatting) on the CD&apos;s to optimize record time and data integrity. Three digital recordings are performed simultaneously: Primary Evidence CD, backup Evidence CD, and Working CD. The CDs can be played back in conventional CD R/W players supporting the Universal Data Format using Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) playback software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The Title III Digital Recording System can be used as a standalone recorder, with front panel control (MODE 1); or as a standalone recorder with computer control (MODE 2). A computer interface is provided in both modes that allows external Case Data to be provided to the Title III Recorder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A third mode of operation allows the Title III Digital Recording System to be integrated with external Dial Number Recognizer (DNR) machines (MODE 3). In this mode, the entire collection process can be controlled via the external computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A fourth mode of operation allows DNR equipment to be integrated with the Title III Recorder (MODE 4). In this mode, the entire collection process can be controlled via the Title III Digital Recording System computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The Title III Digital Recording System solves existing problems. Specifically, and referring to Section 5: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A. Current telephony intercept systems generally accept analog input signals. Technology, and CALEA, now suggest that received telephony may be in digital form. The digital nature of the access precludes the use of conventional and current telephony equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The Title III Digital Recording System allows the recording of digital intercepts directly onto digital media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> B. Current telephony intercept equipment generally operates in a monophonic mode; i.e., a single channel of telephony is recorded in analog fashion. In current two wire systems, this is satisfactory since both sides of a conversation (target and target&apos;s associate) are contained in the single channel. This is not necessarily true with the newer technologies, whereby the target and the associate may be on individual analog or digital lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The Title III Digital Recording System allows stereo analog recording, with either analog or digital signals. The Title III Recorder allows n-channel recording with digital input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> C. Facsimile intercepts are very important to Law Enforcement agencies. However, current analog recording systems do not allow the fidelity required for post-processing and generation of intercepted facsimile data from conventional analog tapes normally used by Law Enforcement agencies. Because of this, expensive facsimile intercept systems must be individually allocated to each intercept (very expensive and resource inefficient), rather than using a single facsimile intercept system for use on collected data from a number of different target intercepts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The Title III Digital Recording System allows for high fidelity recording of intercepted analog or digital signals. The fidelity is sufficient to recover intercepted facsimile signals from the recorded CD media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> D. Record time for current analog recorders is very limited. For example, current analog recording systems generally use audiocassette tapes limited to one-hour record times (maximum). The problem is exacerbated by Title 18 requirements, which call for both a primary and backup recording. The frequent changing of audio analog tapes results in periodic &ldquo;missed&rdquo; intercepts and bookkeeping/accounting difficulties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The Title III Digital Recording System allows 20 hours of record time on a single CD. When operating in a non Title III mode (multiple simultaneous recordings not required), the recorder can &ldquo;cascade&rdquo; the recording, allowing 60 hours of digital recording before changing CDs. (20 hours per CD) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> E. Intercepted conversations, recorded on analog tapes, are transcribed to paper format via transcription specialists. The transcription process for analog tapes is cumbersome, due to the slow forward/reverse control of the analog tape machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The Title III Digital Recording System records in conventional digital formats (WAVE files, or others). Consequentially, the playback of selected segments does not require mechanical forward or reverse tape motion. Any segment of the intercept can be accessed via COTS playback software via a simple &ldquo;point and click operation&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> F. Dubbing of analog media, required, for example, in legal discovery situations, is cumbersome and time consuming when using analog media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Dubbing of the Title III Digital Recording System intercepts can be performed simply with COTS software. It involves only the copying of files from one CD to another CD. Further, using COTS software, specific segments of interest can be easily selected and &ldquo;dubbed&rdquo; by copying to another file, and subsequently to CD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The CD can be made even more accessible by &ldquo;closing out&rdquo; to ISO format, vs. the Universal data Format. In this case, the CD can be read by virtually any CD player in modem computers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> G. With current recording systems, it is very difficult to mark events of interest. For example, current procedures call for an event of interest (segment of tape recording with evidentiary content, beginning of a critical conversation, etc) to be marked by the operator via written format, with the time recorded. No direct correlation of the event occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The Title III Digital Recording System allows the marking of events by depressing a front panel button or keyboard interaction. Each event is time tagged, and recorded on the CD along with the intercept audio. Because of the digital recording technique, the time of each audio sample can be directly correlated to the Event time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> H. Current Law Enforcement analog recording techniques do not allow network control of resources from a single point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> With the Title III recording System, individual recorders can be linked over a network. Multiple recorders can be controlled from a single remote computer, located either on the local network or externally over the INTERNET. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">7.0 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The Title III Recorder is capable of operating in the following modes of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> 1. MODE 1. Standalone Mode, no monitor or keyboard </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In this mode, the Title III Recorder accepts remote start inputs from an external DNR or other source. The recorder front panel (Touch Screen) minimization control is used for minimization control. All target intercept data outputs (call initiation, start/stop time, etc) is generated by the Recorder. No data interface exists with the external DNR. All operator control is via the Recorder Front Panel Touch Screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> 2. MODE 2&mdash;Standalone Mode, with monitor and keyboard </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In this mode all operator control (except headphone and speaker volume and balance) is via the monitor/keyboard and mouse. Local Front panel operation is disabled (display shall show REMOTE, or alternatively, the Touch Screen may be removed) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> 3. MODE 3&mdash;Remote Mode with Computer Control </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> This mode is similar to Mode 2, except control is via an application resident on a separate PC. Communication is via TCP/IP. This mode also allows the capability for control of multiple recording resources over a network. The network can be either local (e.g. ETHERNET) or external (recorder control over the INTERNET); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Variations of these modes are allowed. For example, control may be via software hosted on an external DNR computer, or the DNR may be hosted within the recorder, resulting in an integrated collection system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The Standalone recorder configuration (Mode 1), with front panel operation, is shown in FIG. 7.0-2. In this configuration, the recorder accepts analog or digital intercept audio from a collection source. A remote start command may be provided by a separate collection device (DNR, etc), or the operator may manually start the recorder. The operator controls the Title III Recorder via the front panel, and is able to monitor the intercept, adjust the recorder, and produce CD&apos;s containing Intercept Data and audio. The Intercept Data may also be printed on an optional data logger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The minimization process is performed by either the DNR or the Title III recorder. Minimization is a Law Enforcement term, denoting the cessation of recording and monitoring during periods of non-evidentiary intercept. The operator, when determining that the intercepted conversation is not relevant to the case, &ldquo;minimizes&rdquo; the conversation (shuts off the monitor and record functions). Periodically, the operator revisits the intercept to determine if the conversation is relevant.
