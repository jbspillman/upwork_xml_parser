<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This application relates to the field of vibration analysis and more particularly to the field of performing vibration analysis for the purpose of providing device adjustments that reduce vibrations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Rotors which propel helicopters and other propeller-driven aircraft induce vibrations in the structure supporting the rotor. The vibrations occur at frequencies that correspond to the shaft rotation rate and harmonics thereof. The vibrations may result in a structural damage, crew fatigue, and ultimately become one of the factors limiting the maximum forward speed of the aircraft. Similar types of vibrations are produced by fans and compressors and fixed installations as well as by marine propellers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A primary source of the vibration problem is non-uniform air loads on the blades, although mass imbalance is not uncommon. Aerodynamic anomalies, however, tend to develop recurrently due to blade wear, damage, deformation, etc. The aerodynamic and mass and stiffness distribution anomalies have often been called &ldquo;tracking faults&rdquo;, since a primary observable feature of the uneven airloads or mass distribution is it tendency for the blades to flap and/or deflect unevenly, and thus follow different &ldquo;tracks&rdquo;. The troublesome manifestation of the aerodynamic and mass imbalance, however, is usually the <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/rev and n/rev vibrations and not the track deviations themselves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is possible to modify the vibration characteristics of a helicopter by &ldquo;rotor trimming&rdquo;, which involves adjusting the weight of the blades at the hub, the tab setting at one or more blades, and the adjustment on the pitch rods. However, determining the effect of each of these adjustments may be difficult because the interdependence of the adjustments. This interdependence may be the source of some difficulty with trial and error methods of rotor trimming, which may allow variation of only one type of adjustment at a time. One set of adjustments may be thrown out of kilter by a subsequent step in the process, requiring repetitive adjustments which may or may not converge to an acceptable state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Some helicopter rotor trim balancing methods rely, at least in part, upon making the track of each blade identical using, for example, known optical methods. Optical methods, however, employ bulky equipment which relies upon an operator in the co-pilot seat and procedures which require considerable flight time. Furthermore, optical methods cannot always &ldquo;see&rdquo; the blades during a complete revolution and thus cannot be expected to achieve perfect aerodynamic trim. Thus, it is desirable to trim the rotor without having to resort to optical tracking. Fortunately, mechanically balancing the rotors to reduce vibrations often has the desirable effect of improving the rotor track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Mechanical balancing of rotors with mass imbalance may, in some cases, be performed with a single accelerometer and a shaft-phase reference sensor. However, uneven air loads may not be fully diagnosed and corrected with such a technique. Other techniques used to perform the rotor smoothing function may rely upon optical tracking in conjunction accelerometers. Known rotor smoothing systems, however, process vibration data in such a way that there may be an inherent ambiguity in the interpretation of the signatures. The ambiguity comes about because, in many cases, the number of channels processed simultaneously is inadequate to fully separate translational and rotational acceleration components at a given point. Thus, the motion of the helicopter (and in particular the rotor support) in response to a rotor anomalies may be incompletely specified. Furthermore, some systems may not deduce the corrections needed from the Fourier coefficients related to each anomaly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,937,758, which is incorporated herein by reference, attempts to address these problems by disclosing techniques that take into account the interdependence of the adjustments. However, the system disclosed therein suffers from drawbacks, including difficulties in adequately relating different types of adjustments to each other and difficulties associated with specifying adjustments that do not take into account acceptable granularity and quantization of the adjustments. Furthermore, it is also desirable to minimize the risk associated with a proposed adjustment where the risk corresponds to the size of the adjustment when compared to the maximum allowable adjustment of that type (i.e., it is more risky to make a large adjustment than a small one). In addition, in some instances it is desirable to be able to correlate risks associated with different types of adjustments (e.g., compare the risk associated with an N ounce hub weigh adjustment with the risk associated with an M degree tab bend). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, determining adjustments to decrease vibrations caused by rotating blades includes receiving a plurality of vibration values corresponding to vibrations caused by the blades, providing coefficient of vibration data that corresponds to effects on vibration caused by adjustments to the blades, where the adjustments include at least two different types of adjustments having different units of measure, applying the coefficient of vibration data to the vibration values, and solving for possible values for the adjustments that may be applied to the blades, where the possible values for the adjustments results in the vibrations being less than a predetermined value and where the different types of adjustments are normalized according to a maximum amount of adjustment for each type of adjustment.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> helicopter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown having a rotor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with a plurality of blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. One of the blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be selected as a reference blade and each of the other blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be assigned a blade number starting with zero for the reference blade and increasing by one in the direction of rotation. For example, for the four-blade rotor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the blades may be numbered zero through three. Note that the system described herein may work with a different number of blades such as seven. Generally, for a system with B blades, the blades may each have an assigned blade number from zero through B&minus;1. In addition, in some embodiments, the blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be identified by assigning a unique color to each blade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Rotation of the blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> generates vibrations in the helicopter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As described in more detail below, the vibrations may be measured by sensors and then used as inputs to a process that determines adjustments that can be made to the blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to reduce the vibrations. In some embodiments, the adjustments include hub weights, trailing edge tabs, and PCR changes. Other embodiments may also include tip weights of the blades. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The position of the reference blade may be defined by an azimuth angle &psgr; between the blade itself and a center line <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the fusilage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of a rotor hub <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the helicopter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be equally spaced, so that the position of a blade may be given by the expression &psgr;&plus;(b*&agr;), where &agr;&equals;2&psgr;/b is the inter-blade spacing angle and b is the blade index number, which runs from zero through B&minus;1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As the rotor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> turns, the angle &psgr; increases. One complete rotation corresponds with an increase in &psgr; of 2&pgr; radians or 360&deg;. The rate of rotation of the rotor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is usually controlled by an engine governor and thus is substantially constant. Therefore, the azimuth angle is proportional to time, T, and thus may be expressed in terms of T. If the rate of rotation is so designated by &ohgr;, then &psgr;&equals;&ohgr;*T. In addition, because of the simple relationship between Azimuth angle and T, &psgr; may also be used as a &ldquo;dimensionless&rdquo; measure of time. Motions of the blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and forces of rotor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which may normally be thought of as being functions of time, may also be expressed as functions of &psgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> sensor array <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of sensors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that measure vibration of the helicopter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> near a center of mass at a point <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The system described herein may be expanded to accommodate additional sensors. In some embodiments, the sensors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be arranged in a cube which is mounted so as to allow direct computation of three orthogonal translation and three orthogonal rotational accelerations, as described elsewhere herein. Examples of commercially available sensors that may be used include Part No. CE581M101 Uniaxial accelormeter and/or the Part No. 44-581-000-121 BiAxial Accelormeter, both manufactured by Vibro-Meter Corp. The sensors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be rigidly attached to the helicopter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, ideally near the center of mass <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> thereof. The x, y, z position of each of the sensors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with respect to the center of mass <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be known, as well as the positive sensing direction of each of the sensors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the sensitivities thereof. In addition, the angular position of the rotor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be sensed by one or more tachometers (not shown) that sense the relative position of each of the blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with respect to the center line <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the helicopter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The array of sensors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> utilizes six one degree of freedom accelerometers which may be mounted in pairs. The six uniaxle accelerometers <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be mounted in convenient positions around the rigid framework of the helicopter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such that each of the sensors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has an axis of sensitivity parallel to one of the reference axes shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The location of each of the sensors <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be specified by first picking a reference point that can be any convenient point on the rigid framework of the helicopter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (e.g., a bolt head). If the point that is chosen has known coordinates with respect to the center of mass <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, processing is simplified. From the chosen reference point, which has a reference coordinate system that is parallel to the global coordinate system of the helicopter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the Cartesian coordinates of the location of each of the sensor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be determined. The coordinates may be represented by r<highlight><subscript>ab</subscript></highlight>, where the &ldquo;a&rdquo; denotes the number of the sensor and the &ldquo;b&rdquo; denotes the component axis thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, another embodiment of a sensor array <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a single triaxle accelerometer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and three one degree of freedom accelerometers <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The array <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may use the location of the triaxle accelerometer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as a reference point. The output of the triaxle accelerometer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be sufficient to determine the translational acceleration vector of a reference point. Note the array <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> requires fewer sensor locations than the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The locations of the three uniaxle accelerometers <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be determined in a manner somewhat similar to that described above in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Note that the sensor array <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or the sensor array <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be positioned on a single frame to form a six degree of freedom accelerometer and that the frame may be attached to the helicopter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a single entity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> For a system utilizing either the array <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> or the array <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the magnitude of the accelerometer vectors, as measured by the accelerometers, are given as a a<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, a<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, a<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, a<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, a<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, and a<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>. The reference coordinate axes may be parallel to the mass center line coordinate axes. The position vector from the reference point to the center of mass <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be given by r<highlight><subscript>ref/cm </subscript></highlight>with components x<highlight><subscript>ref/cm</subscript></highlight>, y<highlight><subscript>ref/cm </subscript></highlight>and z<highlight><subscript>ref/cm</subscript></highlight>, measured from the reference point to the center mass <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Note also that the array <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and/or the array <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be part of a portable system that is placed in the helicopter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as needed in connection with obtaining data for analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the helicopter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown from three different positions where the axes of acceleration and the x, y, z and the corresponding rotational accelerations are shown is from the center of mass point <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Note that the measurements from the sensors may be combined to provide measurement signals of &ldquo;virtual sensors&rdquo;, which represent vibration values that are desirable to measure and correct for. For example, it may be desirable to have a virtual sensor for the pilot/co-pilot vertical vibrations, which will be determined by, for example, adding the signals from a pair of sensors having vertical axes of orientation near the positions of the pilot and copilot. Similarly, it may be desirable to have a cabin roll virtual sensor, which is determined by taking the difference of the pair of sensors used to determine pilot and copilot vertical vibrations. In one embodiment, the virtual sensors that are measured and processed include pilot/co-pilot vertical, cabin vertical, cabin roll, pilot/co-pilot lateral, cabin lateral, and cabin longitudinal. Note that the pilot/co-pilot lateral virtual sensor may be different from the cabin lateral virtual sensor because the cabin space may move laterally relative to the pilot/co-pilot space in some instances. For the discussion that follows, it is assumed that the sensor inputs that are being processed are the six sensor inputs (virtual sensors) listed above. However, it will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that different sensors (real and/or virtual) may be used to provide the system described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, data from the six sensors and data from the tachometer(s), which measures the angular displacement of the rotor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, may be input to a main processor unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which calculates vibrations of the helicopter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The main processor unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a vibration processor unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a primary processor unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which are interconnected in a conventional manner. The primary processor unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a flight program unit <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and configuration data unit <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which are described in more detail herein. The vibration processor unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be in the same location or a different location than the primary processor unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Similarly, at least some portion(s) of the main processor unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be fixedly installed in the helicopter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the entirety of the main processor unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be a portable device that is used as needed in connection with analyzing vibrations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The vibration processor unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a signal conditioner <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and a signal processor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> connected thereto. The signal conditioner <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> performs initial processing on the six sensor signals and the tachometer signal. The signal processor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> processes the output of the signal conditioner <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to provide calculations of the vibrations, as described elsewhere herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The signal conditioner <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> includes six pre-amplifiers <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> (one for each of the sensors) for pre-amplifying data input to the signal conditioner <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> may be a single pre-amplifier with six channels, or some other arrangement capable of providing pre-amplification of the six sensor signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The output of the pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is provided to a filter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, which filters out noise from the signals. In some embodiments, the filter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is a low pass filter. The output of the filter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is provided to a step gain <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, which adjust the gain of the signals as appropriate for input to a high speed A/D converter <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The step gain <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and the high speed A/D converter <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> cooperate to provide an efficient signal range for the processing described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The tachometer signal (or multiple tachometer signals, depending upon the specific implementation) are applied to a pulse shape filter <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> which buffers and provides a low pass filtering of the signal(s) from the tachometer. The output of the pulse shape filter <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is provided to a step gain <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> and the output of the step gain <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> is provided to an A/D converter <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. As with the sensor signals, the step gain <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> and the A/D converter <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> cooperate to provide an efficient range of signal. The output of the A/D converter <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and the output of the high speed A/D converter <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are combined to provide the digital signal output of the signal conditioner <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Thus, the output of the signal conditioner <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is the sampled sensor signals and sampled tachometer signal in digital form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The signal processor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> receives the output from the signal conditioner <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The signal processor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> includes a digital filter <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> that filters the incoming data. The output of the digital filter <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is provided to a microprocessor <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, a floating point processor <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, and a memory <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, which are arranged in a conventional manner to provide the functionality described herein. The output of the microprocessor <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, and the floating point processor <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, and the memory <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> are provided to a processor interface <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The signal processor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> performs a Fast Fourier transform (FFT) on the input provided thereto from the signal conditioner <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The FFT converts the time domain data from the six sensors to corresponding Fourier coefficients at a selectable number of harmonics of the <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/rev fundamental. The rotation signal from the tachometer is used to determine the fundamental frequency which is a multiple of the rotation rate of the blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The output of the signal processor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is provided to the primary processor unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which is described in more detail elsewhere herein. The output of the signal processor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> may also be provided to a storage card <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and may be displayed to the pilot during flight (or on the ground) with a pilot display and control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The sensor data that is collected and provided to the storage card <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and/or the pilot display and control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be used to determine appropriate helicopter blade adjustments to the hub weights, PCR&apos;s, and blade tabs (and possibly blade tip weights) to reduce vibration of the helicopter. The algorithm for determining the adjustments may be run either on the pilot display and control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or may be run using a conventional processor (computer) that is not fixedly installed in the helicopter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and/or is not used at all in connection with the helicopter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In any case, the algorithm uses the collected sensor data to determine blade adjustments for reducing vibrations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The sensor data may be collected under different flight conditions, known as &ldquo;regimes&rdquo;, so that the algorithm for determining blade adjustments that reduce vibrations does so for all regimes and/or is optimized to reduce vibrations for a specific subset of regimes. The regimes may include, for example, the helicopter being on the ground, hovering, 90 knots, 120 knots, and 150 knots. During the data collection process, the pilot may indicate that the helicopter is in a particular regime by pressing a button or otherwise providing appropriate input to the system by, for example, pressing a button on the pilot display and control unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the system may determine when the aircraft is in a particular regime and initiate data collection automatically. Thus, there may be vibration data for each of the sensors (virtual sensors) collected at each of the regimes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the storage card <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown being coupled to a processor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> via a connection <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> therebetween. Collected data may be provided to the processor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> which determines adjustment information for the blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as described herein. The adjustment information may be provided by the processor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to an output, such as a display <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, so that a user, such as a helicopter maintainer, can view the information to determine how to adjust the blades <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be implemented by any one of a variety of off-the-shelf computing systems capable of providing the functionality described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A system for indicating blade adjustments to decrease vibrations may include empirical data that indicates the effect of each adjustment. That is, there may be empirical data that provides the change in the vibration caused by each type of adjustment. For example, there may be data that shows that at a particular regime, for a particular sensor (virtual sensor), adjusting the tabs of a blade a particular unit amount effects the vibration a particular amount. The calculations and analysis are performed in the frequency domain because in the frequency domain it is possible to assume a linear relationship between the adjustments and the effects the adjustments have on vibration in the frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Fourier components (amplitude and phase) of the incremental accelerations caused by unit adjustments of the reference blade, (e.g., a 1 degree deflection of a tab, a pitch link adjustment which causes a 1 degree change in blade angle of attack, etc.) are also used. This data may be obtained from flight test data using the system described herein by systematically making adjustments and either changing the Fourier coefficients or performing an analysis and using the data that is specific to each particular helicopter configuration and operating condition. From the data (which pertains to unit adjustments applied to the reference blade), acceleration caused by similar adjustments to other blades may be computed. Based upon a dynamic model of the rotor system, a particular set of adjustments which most nearly negates the measured acceleration (thereby minimizing vibration) is computed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> To simplify a description of the procedure involved, an example will be discussed which considers only one type of rotor blade adjustment, the trailing edge tab settings, and only one flight condition, which need not be specified. The acceleration generated at the rotor hub <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a one degree downward deflection of the trailing edge tab on a reference blade might be denoted by the function T(&psgr;). (Note that T(&psgr;) may be a vector-valued function having three components T<highlight><subscript>x(&psgr;)</subscript></highlight>, T<highlight><subscript>y(&psgr;) </subscript></highlight>and T<highlight><subscript>z(&psgr;)</subscript></highlight>, denoting accelerations along each of three orthogonal directions.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The acceleration generated by a similar 1 degree deflection of the tab on blade b is then T(&psgr;&plus;b&Dgr;), and the acceleration caused by a deflection in the amount a<highlight><subscript>b </subscript></highlight>is</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Combining this property with the periodicity of the sequence, it can be shown that A<highlight><subscript>0 </subscript></highlight>is a real number, as is A<highlight><subscript>B/2</subscript></highlight>, if B is even. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in the equation for a<highlight><subscript>tab</subscript></highlight>, the A<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>&apos;s form a frequency mask.

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The vibrations are thus analyzed in the frequency domain, allowing determination of many orders of effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A basic equation for analyzing the vibrations as well as the effect of adjustments to the blades is:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>v&equals;u&plus;X&middot;a</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> where v represents the vibrations after adjustment, u represents the vibration before adjustment, a represents the adjustment, and X represents coefficient of vibration data that corresponds to effects on vibration caused by the adjustments. All of the quantities are multivalued and thus are represented as matrixes. The values for X are determined in a manner consistent with that described above for empirically determining the effect of adjustments on acceleration (vibration). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The matrixes u and v may be k by one matrixes where k equals the number of harmonic orders of interest (i.e., the number that are analyzed) multiplied by the number of regimes. If there are three adjustments (i.e., tabs, PCR&apos;s and hub weights), then a is a three by one matrix and X is a k by three matrix. Note that, if it is desirable to include tracking data, the data can be added to the u and v arrays and added to the X array in the same way that a new regime would be added. In that case, the calculations discussed herein for minimizing vibrations would, in fact, be minimizing and performing calculations on the combination of vibrations and track data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The goal is to solve for a so that v represents a relatively low amount of vibration (or, as discussed above, a combination of vibration and track data, which will be hereinafter referred to as vibration for simplicity). The amount of vibration associated with v is &par;v&par; (the norm of the matrix v). Ideally, it is desirable to drive &par;v&par; to zero (i.e., have all entries of the matrix equal zero). However, doing so in many instances results in a somewhat large (and thus risky) set of suggested adjustments. In addition, since there may be errors inherent in the system due to errors in adjustment, measurement, calculating the effects of adjustments, etc., then it is not necessary to drive &par;v&par; to zero. Instead, it is sufficient to cause &par;v&par; to be less than a predetermined value, &dgr;. In some embodiments, &dgr; may be set to the sum of all of the expected values of errors associated with an adjustment. Note that, although it may not be possible to know with certainty where errors are specifically occurring (e.g., the measurement of coefficients or the adjustments themselves), it is still possible to estimate the total expected error. Note further that different sets of adjustments that fall within the total expected error are indistinguishable in terms of predicting their ability to improve the vibration characteristics of the aircraft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The following solves for the adjustment, a, using the constraint that &par;v&par;&lt;&dgr;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> QR decomposition is a known technique that may be used to solve matrix equations. In this instance, matrixes Q and R are chosen so that Q&middot;R equals X. In addition, QR decomposition provides that Q is such that Q<highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>&middot;Q equals I, the identity matrix. Thus,</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> multiplying through by Q<highlight><superscript>T </superscript></highlight>yields:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> since &par;v&par;&lt;&dgr; and multiplying v by Q<highlight><superscript>T </superscript></highlight>simply scales the norm of v, then:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>&par;Q</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&middot;u&plus;R&middot;a</italic></highlight>&par;&lt;&dgr;(or a different &dgr;, scaled by &par;Q<highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>&par;)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> How the equation set forth above may be used to solve for a is discussed in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In the course of solving for a, it is possible to find a solution in a way that minimizes vibrations at the fundamental frequency and/or the harmonics by performing the computations set forth above using a subset of the matrixes corresponding to the frequencies of interest. However, because the adjustments affect vibrations at all of the frequencies, in some instances it is possible that an adjustment will decrease vibrations at one frequency while increasing vibrations at another frequency. On the other hand, there is a relationship between the vibrations at various frequencies such that optimizing on the shaft order S provides for simultaneous adjustment on any frequency corresponding to the following:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(<highlight><italic>N&times;B</italic></highlight>)&plus;/&minus;<highlight><italic>S</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> where N is an integer and B corresponds to the number of blades. Thus, optimizing on the first order frequency (i.e., S&equals;1) for a seven blade helicopter also affects the 6th and 8th orders (N&equals;1), the 13th and 15th orders (N&equals;2), etc. In other words, a<highlight><subscript>F1</subscript></highlight>&equals;a<highlight><subscript>F2 </subscript></highlight>in instances where F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> obey the relationship set forth above. Note that the even in instances where F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> meet the criteria set forth above, X<highlight><subscript>F1 </subscript></highlight>does not necessarily equal X<highlight><subscript>F2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Note that, for embodiments where the blade adjustments include hub weights, tabs, and PCR&apos;s, it is necessary to provide a mechanism to correlate the various values. Otherwise, it is difficult to determine how to compare, for example, one ounce of weight for a hub weight adjustment with one degree of tab deflection. In embodiments disclosed herein, adjustment values used, for example, in the X array and the a array, are normalized according to a maximum value for each adjustment. Thus, if the maximum hub weight adjustment is, for example, twenty ounces, then one ounce would be represented as 0.05. Similar normalization may be used for the PCR adjustments and the tab deflection adjustments (and possibly blade tip weight adjustments). Normalizing the adjustment values allows for computations that compare and/or combine the values. In addition, normalizing by one over the maximum allowable amount for each of the types of adjustment provides a weighting that compensates values for each type of adjustment according to the percent of the allowable range represented by a particular adjustment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, normalization occurs by computing a weight norm matrix:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&middot;E&middot;a</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> where E is a diagonal matrix where the diagonal elements equal the inverse of the maximum amount for each physical adjustment. Thus, if the maximum PCR adjustment is twenty clicks, the diagonal element of E corresponding to the PCR adjustment is 1/20. That way, any PCR values in the a matrix are normalized according to the maximum PCT adjustment. Hub weight and tab adjustments are similarly normalized, thus making it possible to correlate the risks (i.e., the amount of change) associated with different types of adjustments. For example, for purposes of risk assessment, a weight adjustment that is one half of the maximum allowable weight adjustment is equivalent to a tab adjustment that is one half of the maximum allowable tab adjustment. Note that it is possible to normalize using values that are different from the maximum range of each of the adjustments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The system discussed herein minimizes the weight norm matrix, a<highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>&middot;E&middot;a, subject to the constraint discussed above of &par;Q<highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>&middot;u&plus;R&middot;a&par;&lt;&dgr;. Minimization of a<highlight><superscript>T</superscript></highlight>&middot;E&middot;a may be performed using any one of a variety of conventional techniques, such as the Newton-Raphson technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Once an appropriate value for a is found, it is necessary to convert the calculated adjustment, which is expressed in the a matrix in the Fourier domain, back to a real adjustment. This may be performed by multiplying the a matrix by an inverse DFT matrix, where each of the rows of the inverse DFT matrix correspond to the blade to be adjusted and each of the columns corresponds to the adjustment type. Note that for a system with B blades, there will be B&minus;1 rows since only B&minus;1 blades (at the most) are adjusted. Note further that, for weight adjustments, only two blades at most need be adjusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The inverse DFT matrix is a B&times;B matrix. Elements of the inverse DFT matrix are given by:
