<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an ink jet printing process for improving the ozone stability of an inkjet image. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Ink jet printing is a non-impact method for producing images by the deposition of ink droplets in a pixel-by-pixel manner to an image-recording element in response to digital signals. There are various methods which may be utilized to control the deposition of ink droplets on the image-recording element to yield the desired image. In one process, known as continuous ink jet, a continuous stream of droplets is charged and deflected in an imagewise manner onto the surface of the image-recording element, while unimaged droplets are caught and returned to an ink sump. In another process, known as drop-on-demand inkjet, individual ink droplets are projected as needed onto the image-recording element to form the desired image. Common methods of controlling the projection of ink droplets in drop-on-demand printing include piezoelectric transducers and thermal bubble formation. Ink jet printers have found broad applications across markets ranging from industrial labeling to short run printing to desktop document and pictorial imaging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The inks used in the various ink jet printers can be classified as either dye-based or pigment-based. A dye is a colorant which is molecularly dispersed or solvated by a carrier medium. The carrier medium can be a liquid or a solid at room temperature. A commonly used carrier medium is water or a mixture of water and organic co-solvents. Each individual dye molecule is surrounded by molecules of the carrier medium. In dye-based inks, no particles are observable under the microscope. Although there have been many recent advances in the art of dye-based ink jet inks, such inks still suffer from deficiencies such as low optical densities on plain paper and poor light-fastness. When water is used as the carrier medium, such inks also generally suffer from poor water-fastness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The ink jet receiving elements that can be used with the above mentioned inks must meet several requirements including producing high density images that will not smear, bleed or wander when exposed to water for short periods of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,632,703, 6,149,722 and 6,015,896, WO 00/08103 and WO 98/49239 relate to inks containing phthalocyanine dyes used in ink jet printing. However, there is no disclosure in these references that these inks would be useful with a recording element containing a porous image-receiving layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention to provide an inkjet printing process for improving the ozone stability of an ink jet image. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Compound 2 as illustrated above was prepared as follows: Copper phthalocyanine (14 g) was added to chlorosulfonic acid (125 g) over 45 minutes, while keeping the temperature below 40&deg; C. The mixture was then heated to 140-150&deg; C. and stirred for 5 hours. After cooling to room temperature, thionyl chloride (49 g) was added dropwise over 30 minutes, and the mixture kept at 80 &deg; C. for 3 hrs. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured on ice and stirred vigorously, while keeping the temperature below 5&deg; C. Precipitate was filtered off, washed extensively with water at 5&deg; C., and used in the next step. N,N-Bis(hydroxyethyl)trimethylene diamine (27 g) and sodium carbonate (15 g) were dissolved in 500 mL water at 5&deg; C. Wet phthalocyanine filter cake was added all at once, and the reaction mixture warmed to room temperature, and then heated at 50&deg; C. overnight. Ethanol (1.5 L) was added, and mostly inorganic material was filtered off. Liqueurs were concentrated, and the product precipitated with acetone, filtered off, washed with ethanol, and dried to yield compound 2. The other compounds in Table 1 and nickel analogs were prepared in a similar manner. </paragraph>
