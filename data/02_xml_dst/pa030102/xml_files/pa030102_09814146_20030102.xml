<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> I. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to tools for sanding or grinding. More particularly, the present invention relates to a contour sanding apparatus for use with hand-held power tools, enabling a user to abrade contoured surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> II. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Belt sanders have been used for abrading or sanding many different types of surfaces. Free standing or bench mounted belt sanders typically have three rollers, which control the travel of the abrading belt. One of these three rollers will be driven and the other two rollers remain idle or free spinning. Normally the work area of these belt sanders is in between the two idler rollers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Most of today&apos;s bench top or pedestal type belt sanders will incorporate a rigid planar work plate that is secured and located within this work area. The abrading loop or belt will travel in front of the work plate, which is used as a support on the backside of the sanding belt while abrading the workpiece on the front side of the sanding belt. As the work plate is a rigid planar plate, these belt sanders are adapted primarily for abrading flat or straight surfaces and, consequently, cannot effectively sand contoured surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Power sanders having contouring capability are currently available. However, these are more costly and are generally limited to use on a specific contour. Accordingly, some of today&apos;s contour abrading is still being done by means of time consuming and tiresome efforts of physically sanding by hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A number of patents are directed to power sanding of contours. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,116,999, discloses a sander with the capability of sanding a bullnose concave surface by using sheets of abrasive materials, clamped in accordance with a flexible pad. Through capable of abrading a concave workpiece, it is limited to only that concave surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,725,423, discloses a back-up pad provided for supporting an abrasive article during abrading. Though capable of abrading some contours, this method is limited to abrading only slights contours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,662,519, discloses a contour sander designed for sanding the details and curves of automobile body panels. This sander is limited to manual use and may not be adapted for use on a power sander. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,187, discloses a flexible device for holding abrasive materials, which can be adjusted to a variety of shapes. Though capable of conforming to a variety of curved shapes, the device has to be manually adjusted to each shape separately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 3,956,858, discloses a flexible hand held abrading tool, which can easily conform to curves and contours. However, this is also limited to a manually operated hand held tool and not for use on power sanders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In addition to traditional belt sanders, a number of hand held attachments directed at sanding and grinding have been introduced to the market. Typically, these attachments are mechanically coupled to the power tool at the site where a standard attachment, such as a drill-bit or sanding-wheel is otherwise placed. In spite of the advantages that these add-on devices may provide, they have not adequately addressed the problems associated with grinding or sanding surfaces intended to be non-flat. This is because these existing devices present either a flat or fixed-radius surface as a backing for the grind/sanding belt, which is a serious limitation for ornate work pieces incorporating curved portions. As a consequence, portions of such complex and ornate work-pieces tend to be either over-worked or under-worked during the finishing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A number of patents have been directed to hand held sanding attachments. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,551,951, discloses a detachable portable continuous-belt driving head for use in conjunction with an air driven rotatable spindle. By wrapping a sanding belt around the work-piece, this device can be used to sand or grind a significant portion of the circular contour of a cylindrical work-piece such as a pipe. However, wrapping such a belt around an uninterrupted span of pipe requires that the belt be &lsquo;seamed,&rsquo; that is that it has seam where it can be opened and then rejoined. In other words, before this device can be used on a pipe, the ends of the grinding belt must be separated at the seam, the belt must be wrapped around the pipe, and the ends o the belt must be rejoined. This process is time consuming. Furthermore, the use of seam-containing grinding belts can be hazardous, since they are vulnerable to operator error in connecting and disconnecting the belt that can lead to the belt flying off the rollers, causing injury or damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,858,390 and 5,031,362, disclose similar endless-belt grinding attachments for use in conjunction with typical hand-held electric or pneumatic power drills. Both of these devices have a drive pulley, driven by the output of a power tool, and in idler-pulley disposed at the end, distal to the drive pulley, of an arm member. In use, a grinding belt is mounted on these pulleys. Because the grinding belt so mounted conforms to a single longitudinal axis these devices are limited to relatively small angles of contact when used with work pieces having curved contours, such as pipes or toroidal shapes. Consequently, it is difficult to use either of these devices to satisfactorily grind such curved surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,578,906 discloses another device using an endless grinding belt. This device is similar to those of U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,858,390 and 5,031,362 in that it has two pulleys, one being a drive-pulley. These pulleys are mounted at the ends of a longitudinal arm-member. An endless grinding belt fits over the pulleys and is stretched to an essentially flat configuration, so that it presents a flat grinding surface to the work piece. A spring is mounted coaxially with the arm-member and is used as a bias means for keeping the belt under tension and thus flat. However, this device has the same limitations as those described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need for a contour sanding device for use with standard sanding belts, which can work the surface of a variety of complex, ornate shapes, and can provide proper backing for a variety of contours or flat surfaces of a work-piece. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a contour sanding apparatus for driving a sanding belt. For purposes of this application, the term sanding belt means an abrasive belt, such as those manufactured of sandpaper, steel wool, SCOTCHBRITEO&reg;, or any other art recognized abrasive belts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the apparatus includes a body and a drive pulley rotatably attached to the body, the drive pulley comprising a drive-axle dimensioned for attachment to a source of rotation. A primary arm is fixedly attached to the body and includes an end portion to which a primary idler pulley is rotatably attached. A secondary arm is also provided. The secondary arm includes tensioning means for maintaining the sanding belt in tension, and a first end portion to which a secondary idler pulley is rotatably attached. The secondary idler pulley is disposed in relation to the primary idler pulley such that the sanding belt forms a sanding portion between the primary idler pulley and the secondary idler pulley. The sanding belt is dimensioned for disposal about the drive pulley, the primary idler pulley, and the secondary idler pulley such that the a sanding portion of the sanding belt, disposed between the primary idler pulley and the secondary idler pulley, may be made to conform to a plurality of contours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the secondary arm extends from, and is pivotally attached to, the primary arm via a second end portion, which is disposed within a central slot in the central portion of the primary arm. The preferred secondary arm includes a non-slidable section that includes the second end portion, and a slidable section that includes the secondary idler pulley. It is preferred that a sleeve be slidably disposed about the non-slidable section such that the sleeve and the slidable section may slide along the non-slidable section when acted upon by the axial force exerted by the tensioning means. The preferred tensioning means is a spring disposed between the slidable section and the non-slidable section such that the spring exerts a axial force upon the slidable section relative to the non-slidable section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In some alternative embodiments of the invention, the tensioning means is a fluid cylinder having a non-slidable section that includes the second end portion, and a slidable section that includes the secondary idler pulley. In these embodiments, the fluid cylinder includes a connection for pressurizing fluid within the fluid cylinder such that an axial force is exerted upon the slidable section relative to the non-slidable section. In other embodiments, the sleeve is eliminated and the slidable portion is dimensioned to slide along the non-slidable portion. In still other embodiments of the invention, the tensioning means of the secondary arm is eliminated and the tension on the sanding belt is adjusted by adjusting the location of the drive pulley for a desired profile or by utilizing an elastic sanding belt, such as to described in pending U.S. Application No. 19/519,086, filed by the present inventors on Mar. 6, 2000, which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment also includes a retainment-arm to which a retainment-pulley is mounted. The preferred retainment-arm is pivotally connected to the primary arm and disposed such that the retainment pulley contacts the sanding belt and directs it through a channel in the body. In some embodiments of the invention, one or more additional retainment pulleys are disposed at other locations about the apparatus to further guide the sanding belt. In still others, the retainment pulley is eliminated. In these embodiments, the body is either eliminated or is dimensioned to avoid contact with the rotating sanding belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The preferred retainment-arm, primary idler pulley, secondary idler pulley and drive pulley all include a drive layer manufactured of a flexible and substantially resilient material, such as rubber. This resilient material is preferred as it counteracts variations in belt tension and allows non-standard sanding belts, such as belts made of a material of the type sold by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company of St. Paul, Minn. under the trademark SCOTCHBRITE&reg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the invention also includes support attachments that may be disposed between the primary arm and secondary arm to provide support to the sanding portion of the sanding belt when contoured surfaces are sanded. In one preferred embodiment, the apparatus is sold in kit form along with a variety of support attachments; preferably including at least one flex plate attachment and at least one support shelf. In such an embodiments, a wider range of contours may be sanded than is possible by utilizing the apparatus alone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The preferred flex plate attachment is disposed between, and attached to, the primary arm and the secondary arm proximate to the primary idler pulley and the secondary idler pulley. The flex plate attachment includes a lower support area, an upper support area, and a flexible work area that extends between the lower support area and the upper support area. The length of the flexible work area may be varied to allow plurality of arcs to be formed, with short work areas allowing the user to sand small diameter profiles and long work areas allowing large diameter profiles to be sanded. Accordingly, it is preferred that the kit includes flex plate attachments having flexible work areas of varying lengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The flex plate attachment may be manufactured of any material that is flexible enough to form a plurality of arcs without breaking or plastically deforming. The preferred materials for the flex plate attachment are polycarbonate and spring steel, which are preferred for light duty and heavy duty applications respectively. However, hard rubber or other spring metals are utilized in other embodiments. In some embodiments, the flex plate attachment is coated with a wear resistant coating, such a polytetraflouroethene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The preferred support shelf is substantially rigid and includes a rigid work area that is dimensioned to allow the sanding belt to conform to a desired contour. The preferred rigid work area is substantially planar and is utilized to provide support during the sanding of flat surfaces. However, it is recognized that a variety of rigid work areas, such as concave and convex surfaces, may be formed into the support shelf, allowing the apparatus to sand a particular contour. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, a support attachment is attached to the primary arm and secondary arm via a pair of mounting details, with the lower mounting detail being attached to the primary arm and the upper mounting detail being attached to the secondary arm. A variety of mounting details may be utilized, although the preferred embodiment includes one pivotal snapping detail and one pivotal pinning detail. These details are preferred as they allow the support attachment to be retained upon one of the arms when it is disengaged, allowing the user to avoid removal of the attachment when no support attachment is desired, while allowing for a quick engagement when such an attachment is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment also includes a locking means for securing the secondary arm in-a desired position relative to the primary arm. Such a locking means allows distance between the arms, and hence the length of the sanding portion of the sanding belt, to be varied. In embodiments utilizing a flex plate attachment, the locking means may be utilized to lock the flex plate attachment into place once it has been flexed to a desired profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the source of rotation for the contour sanding attachment is a separate tool, such as a hand held drill, grinder or the like. In these embodiments, it is understood that the contour sanding apparatus will be sold as an attachment for use with an existing source of rotation and, therefore, will utilize drive axles dimensioned for attachment thereto. Some embodiments of the axles include a smooth or knurled shaft that is dimensioned for gripping by a chuck of a drill or roto-tool. Others, such as those adapted for attachment to grinders, include counter-threaded screw type attachments. In some alternative embodiments, the contour sanding apparatus includes an integral source of rotation. In such embodiments, the drive axle of the drive pulley may be formed integral to the source of rotation, rather than being attached to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is an aspect of the invention to provide a contour sanding apparatus that may be adapted for use as an attachment to existing belt sanders and hand held power tools, or as a stand alone apparatus including a source of rotation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a contour sanding apparatus that may include a plurality of support attachments to support the sanding belt so as to follow a desired contour. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a contour sanding apparatus that will allow the sander to abrade a variety of contoured surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a contour sanding apparatus that will be safe, easy to use and affordable for consumers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a contour sanding apparatus that may include a flex plate attachment that enables it to sand either flat or contoured surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a contour sanding attachment that may be utilized with a polishing sanding belt, such as a SCOTCHBRITE&reg; belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a contour sanding attachment that may be utilized with an elastic sanding belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It is a still further aspect of the invention to provide a flex plate attachment for a contour sanding apparatus that aids in the sanding of a variety of contours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> These aspects of the invention are not meant to be exclusive and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art when read in conjunction with the following description, appended claims and accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Referring first to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the preferred embodiment of the contour sanding apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown. This preferred apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is similar to the contour sanding apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the Applicant&apos;s co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/589,507, filed on Jun. 7, 2000, in that the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a drive pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a primary arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and a secondary arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. However, a number of improvements have been made to provide greater versatility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the contour sanding apparatus device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a body <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> that houses a drive-pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. It is the drive-pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that provides the motive force to a standing belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in use. The motive force causing the drive-pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to rotate may come from a drive axle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that is coupled to source of rotation. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the drive axle <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may rotatably mounted in, and supported by, the body <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> by means of a bearing assembly <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the source of rotation may be a chuck <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of a power tool <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, such as a drill, grinder or the like. However, it is recognized that other means for driving the drive-pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, would be readily recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> When the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in operation, the sanding belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is driven by the drive-pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and follows a path defined by the belt-support <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which extends laterally from the body <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the belt-support <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is a compound entity including a primary-arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a secondary-arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, this belt support <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also includes one of a variety of support attachments <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that are disposed between the primary arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and secondary arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the second end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the support attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is shown as a free end, which is rotated away from the sanding belt. However, as described in detail with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the second end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is dimensioned for attachment to the end of the primary-arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The support attachments <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be used to support the sanding portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the sanding belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which is the portion that passes over the belt-support <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> between the primary arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and secondary arm. By varying the angular relationships between the elements of the belt-support <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and/or adding various support attachments <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the sanding portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the sanding belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be made to conform to a broad diversity of contours. Such diversity is a significant advantage of the present invention over the traditional art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The preferred primary arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is fixedly mounted to the body <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and includes a primary-arm idler-pulley <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which is rotatably attached at its second end, and a central slot (not shown) disposed within in the central portion of the primary arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The preferred secondary-arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is disposed within, and pivotally connected to, the central slot in the primary-arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at one end via a pivot pin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The other end of the preferred secondary-arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a secondary-arm idler-pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which is rotatably attached to the end. The primary-arm idler pulley <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the secondary-arm idler-pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> facilitate the passage of the sanding belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> around its path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, a retainment pulley <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is disposed at the end of a retainment-arm <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to further direct the sanding belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to remain on the desired path. The retainment-arm <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is preferably pivotally connected to the primary-arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> between the pivot-pin <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the body <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Such pivotal connection is preferred as it prevents the retainment pulley <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> from exerting too much additional tension upon the sanding belt. However, this pivotal connection is eliminated in other embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In order to maintain tension on the sanding belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the secondary-arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> preferably includes a tensioning means, such as the compression spring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In the preferred embodiment, the secondary-arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is divided into a slidable section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a non-slidable section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the tensioning means includes a spring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is disposed inside of the slidable section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and exerts an axial force upon the non-slidable section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the total length of the secondary-arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> varies, depending on the configuration of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and, in particular, on the configuration of the belt-support <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> relative to the part to be sanded. As the sanding belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> travels around the drive-pulley <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the primary-arm idler-pulley <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the secondary-arm idler-pulley <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the spring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extends an axial force upon the slidable section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> against the resistance of the sanding belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, thus maintaining tension in the sanding belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the preferred secondary arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also includes a sleeve <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which constrains the spring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the slidable section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to move in a direction coaxial to the longitudinal axis of the non-slidable section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. However, in other embodiments, the sleeve <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is eliminated and the non-slidable section <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to constrain the tensioning means. Further, in some embodiments, the tensioning means is not a spring, but rather is a fluid cylinder, such as a hydraulic or pneumatic cylinder. In such embodiments, it is preferred that the cylinder includes a connection to a source of pressurized fluid in order to allow the tension upon the belt to be controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an embodiment of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which the support attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is a substantially rigid support shelf <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having a planar work area extends and is locked into place between the distal ends of the primary-arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and secondary arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this configuration, belt-support <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> forms a triangle over which the sanding belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> runs when the apparatus is in use. This provides a flat, relatively stable face with which to sand the work-piece (not shown), and allows the user to exert a greater force on the power tool, and consequently on the work-piece, than would be possible without the support attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. However, any one of the three sides of the triangular shape, around which the belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> rotates, can be used to sand or grind the work-piece. In addition, it is recognized that the rigid support shelf <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> need not be planar and may be formed with a rigid support surface having a desired contour. Finally, as described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the support attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be a flex plate attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that is capable of flexing to form a wide variety of contours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows one embodiment of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which the secondary-arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is further lifted away from the primary-arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, with an inter-arm angle <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> being determined by the degree to which the support attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, here a rigid support shelf <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, is unfolded from the secondary-arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In such an embodiment, the frictional contact between the distal end of the support shelf <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the inside of the primary arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> establishes the magnitude of the inter-arm angle <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, to efficiently sand or grind a convex contour of a work-piece using the preferred apparatus, the support attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is either partially unfolded, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, or is eliminated. This permits the secondary-arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to move angularly in relation to the primary-arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing the inter-arm angle <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to vary. When a convex work-piece <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is pushed against the belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the sanding portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the belt moves to a deflected position within the inter-arm section, defined by the primary-arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the secondary-arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, being under the tension inducted by spring <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the retainment-arm pulley <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, conforms to the general contour of the work-piece <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, allowing the contour to be effectively sanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, a flex plate attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for use as a support attachment is shown. The flex plate attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> includes a flexible, bendable region that forms a work area <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. The flexible work area <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> extends between a lower and upper support areas <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, which conformably connect the flexible work area <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and attaching frames <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The attaching frames <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are dimensioned to attach to a variety of different mounts and preferably extend out beyond support areas <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to leave an open area <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> between the mounting details <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The flexible work area <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the flex plate attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be made of a variety of materials. In light duty applications, such as for use in light duty applications, polycarbonate is the preferred material for the flex plate attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. This material is preferred as it has the characteristics needed to obtain the required flex and strength, yet still be able to build up a spring load as it bends and forms. In addition, this material may be manufactured to present no sharp edges, nor will it wear into sharp edges, that may cause harm to unskilled users, such as homeowners, who may purchase a light duty sander having such a flex plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In heavy-duty applications, such as those to be used in industry, the flex plate attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> would preferably be made of spring steel. This material is preferred as it will wear longer than polycarbonate and may be used at higher speeds and temperatures than the light duty flex plate attachment. Further, the individuals exposed to industrial duty belt sanders will be more trained and experienced as opposed to the individuals exposed to the light duty flex plate attached on a light duty belt sander. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Although the above materials are preferred, it is recognized that the flex plate attachment may be manufactured of any material that is flexible enough to form a plurality of arcs without breaking or plastically deforming. For example, hard rubber or other spring metals are utilized in other embodiments. Therefore, the flex plate attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> should not be seen as being limited to the preferred materials, or their equivalents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In some applications, wear pads (not shown) may be utilized to assist in controlling the wearing of the flex plate attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and may help control the amount of force or drag created by the rotating and abrading belt. One material used to make suitable wear pads is polytetraflouroethene, either in sheet form, or as a film adhered directly onto the flex plates. However, in other embodiments, the flex plate attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may itself be coated with a wear resistant material, such as polytetraflouroethene, to provide the same advantages as wear pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the mounting details <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> on the attaching frames are snapping details <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and pinning details <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. However, due to the fact that there are a large variety of means for that may be used for attachment, the flex plate attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may include mounting details <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> that function in a different way from the pivotal snapping details <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and pinning details <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. For example, in some embodiments, the mounting details <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are dimensioned for attachment to a slide mount (not shown), such as an upper slide mount and/or a lower slide mount of a conventional bench mounted belt sander. In others, the mounting details <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> incorporate retainment pulleys. Further, it is recognized that many embodiments will include all of a single type of mounting detail, rather than two different details. Therefore, it should be understood that other art recognized means for attaching frames to mounts may be utilized to achieve similar results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The length of the flexible work area may be varied to allow plurality of arcs to be formed, with short work areas allowing the user to sand small diameter profiles and long work areas allowing large diameter profiles to be sanded. For example, it has been found that a flex plate attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> having length of a one and one half inches will allow a concave surface having a radius of 0.25 inches to be sanded, while one having a five inch length will allow a concave surface having a radius of three inches to be sanded. Accordingly, it is preferred that a number of flex plate attachments <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, each having flexible work areas of varying lengths, be kept on-hand for use with a contour sanding attachment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the preferred flex plate attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> engaging a sanding belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with a workpiece <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to sand a concave profile <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The preferred flex plate attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is attached to the primary arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and secondary arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the contour sanding apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via a pair of pins <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, which rotatably engage the mounting details <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the attaching frames <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The sanding belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> passes over, and substantially conforms to, the outer surface <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the flexible work area <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and is driven by the belt sander (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the attaching frames <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> extend over the sides of the primary arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and secondary arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and are dimensioned to allow a first pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> to pass through the both pinning details <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> on one side of attaching frame <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and be secured such that the attaching frame <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may rotate about the first pin <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The other end of the attaching frame <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to allow both snapping details <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to spread to allow entry of the second pin <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and to capture the second pin <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> such that the attaching frame <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may rotate about the second pin <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. Although it cannot be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it is noted that the open area <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> between the sides of the attaching frame <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is dimensioned to provide enough area to avoid interference with the ends of the primary arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and secondary arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, while allowing clearance for maneuverability of the flex plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the sanding belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is brought into contact with the workpiece <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and pressure is exerted to cause the flexible work area <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to bend to conform to the concave profile <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the workpiece <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The sanding belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is then caused to rotate, effectively sanding the concave profile <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. When pressure is removed, the flexible work area <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> remains in belt contact, but returns to its original, slightly concave, position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the arc formed by the flexible work area <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may be set and locked into place with a desired profile without contacting the workpiece. In this manner, the desired profile may be abraded onto workpiece <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> having a different profile. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, one way of accomplishing this is to provide a locking means <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> disposed between the primary arm <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and secondary arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which allows the angle formed by the arms <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be adjusted and held in a fixed position. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, this is shown as a thumb screw adjustment. However, it is recognized that other locking means <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, such as pins, clips, fluid cylinders, locking screws, or the like, may be utilized to achieve similar results. Similarly, in other embodiments, the slidable portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the secondary arm <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be locked into place at a desired location relative to the non-slidable portion <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. As was the case with the angular setting, this locking means <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> may be a thumb screw adjustment, pin, clip, fluid cylinder, locking screw, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows the flex plate attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> engaging a sanding belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with a workpiece <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to sand a convex profile <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The flex plate attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is substantially the same as the flex plate attachment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, except that the outer surface <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the flexible work area <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is caused to form a convex profile. It is noted that, although the flex plate attachment is shown in this arrangement, convex profiles may also be sanded without the aid of any support attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> via the process described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows the preferred flex plate attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> engaging a sanding belt <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with a workpiece <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to sand a substantially flat surface <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. Once again it is noted that, although the flex plate attachment is shown in this arrangement, flat surfaces may also be sanded without the aid of any support attachment <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, or with the aid of the substantially rigid support shelf via the process described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
