<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An improved accuracy phase shifter having cascaded phase shifting modules is provided for phase shifting a pulse train which rather than utilizing two pairs of control voltage leads for each phase shifting module, utilizes only one pair to significantly reduce the electromagnetic interference between the cascaded phase shifting modules.

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to phase shifting and more particularly to a precision phase shifter having improved accuracy and reduction of complexity. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Note: Applies to fiber optic networks or any broadband, high data rate communication. In fiber optic cable networks, or indeed in any broadband high data rate communications system, there is a requirement to regenerate or amplify the signals along a cable path so as to provide robust communication from a head-end system to a destination or receiver. With transmission rates presently exceeding 10 gigabits/sec., loss of timing results in lost data or degration of data integrity when the pulse trains are transmitted over long distances. In such a high data rate system the behavior of electric circuits is quite similar to microwave circuits operating in the 5 GHz range. Thus, part of the loss of data can be viewed as the result of a phase shift between a data pulse train and a clock pulse train due to the dispersion which occurs in fiber optic cables over long distances. Loss of data can also be due to loss of signal amplitude over the distance and degradation of the signal shape such as broadening of the signal pulse due to dispersion inside the optical cables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The problem involved in the transmission of data streams over long distances is thus the fact that the data streams themselves degrade such that not only is the amplitude of the signals reduced with distance, the waveforms which are originally squared up become degraded. As a result, in some instances the degraded pulse trains cannot be appropriately sampled, retrieved and recovered due to a phase offset in the timing between timing pulses sent at the same time as the data stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the past, the degradation due to dispersion and other artifacts was such that regeneration units needed to be dispersed along the transmission line every 70 to 100 miles. The reason that the regeneration units were necessary was to shape up the pulses that had degraded and to realign them with respect to a timing reference. It will however be appreciated that regeneration units are expensive and in general require an optical filter, a photo detector and an amplifier along with a data-recovery system which after the pulses are squared up are adjusted in time to realign them with a recovered clock signal. Regeneration usually requires converting the optical signals back to electronic, then amplifying and re-shaping, and then converting them into optical signals again. While some regeneration uses all-optics amplifiers without converting into electronic signals and back, there is still the need for electric power to operate the regeneration systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the past, one method of recovering the data involved shifting the entire data stream either forward or backward so that the phase delay between the clock stream and the data stream could be adjusted by the operator for the entire system or in some cases reduced to zero. Note that the amount of shift can be under operator control to achieve desired alignment between data and clock pulse. This was accomplished by dialing in a particular phase shift to shift the data pulse train such that the leading or trailing edges of the clock and data pulses would be aligned </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Phase shift, as used herein, refers to the offset between either leading or trailing edges of a clock pulse and those of the data pulse train. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to shift the pulse train by for instance a full 360&deg;, it was a practice to serially connect or cascade a number of phase shifting modules, that incrementally phase shifted the input signal as it passed through the various phase shifting modules. The desideratum was to be able to exercise phase shift control to one degree of resolution over the entire 360&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This required a large number of phase shifting units of different phase shift angles whose combinations could give any angle between zero and 360&deg;. However, when phase shift modules were serially connected together in a reasonable package, cross talk between the phase-shifting modules, particularly among the control wires to the modules resulted in a practical limit of phase shift resolution to about 12&deg;&plus;/&minus;3&deg; for a bit rate of nominally 10 gigabit/sec, or frequency around 5 GHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that a 12&deg; phase shift is unacceptable in terms of the precision by which the pulse train needed to be shifted with respect to the clock pulse train, and as such, resulted in the inability to eliminate the costly regeneration units. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As will be seen, key to the subject invention is the recognition that the cause of the phase shift errors is the many pairs of control wires to the phase shifting modules inside a compact container, which cause electromagnetic interference with one another in an unpredictable manner. Note that the control wires carry electric voltages that either activate or de-activate a particular phase shifting module. The use of the multiple pains of control was led to the realization that with the presently available phase shifting modules, it would be impossible to reliably control phase shifting to the accuracy required for eliminating the regeneration units in for instance a fiber optic cable system stretching for 2500 miles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Secondly, in the prior art, two voltages on 2 pairs of control wires were utilized for the phase shifting modules to switch in and out two different electrical paths of differing length. In these phase shifters it was found that the two voltages must switch in perfect sync in order for the phase shifts to be reliably produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In point of fact, however, the two control voltages have different voltage rise and fall times which are the result of the internal capacitance of the circuit, such that by utilizing the two voltages and having any mismatch in the rise and fall times, phase shift errors occurred due to mismatch in the transitions in the two voltages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> While it will be noted that dimensional changes of connectors and circuit elements inside the entire phase shifter unit due to temperature changes result in systematic errors which can be characterized by testing and therefore can be compensated, cross talk between the many pairs of control wires results in random errors that cannot be systematically compensated, thus, still presenting a problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The result of the inability to control the phase shift resolution to only 12&deg; at 5 GHz prevented long haul fiber optic cable plants from eliminating the number of regenerators required. The inability to shift the received data pulse trains to the required accuracy thus severely limited the ability to provide a cost-effective high-speed fiber optic network. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It has now been found that in a fiber optic transmission system having a 10-gigabit/sec bit rate a 30&deg;&plus;/&minus;1&deg; resolution is achievable using binary combinations of control voltages in which only one voltage and only one pair of control wires is utilized for the individual phase shifting modules of the phase shifter over the entire range of 360&deg;. It has been found with the subject techniques that each of the phase shifting modules of seven different angles, namely 180&deg;, 90&deg;, 45&deg;, 22.5&deg;, 11.25&deg;, 6&deg; and 3&deg;, can achieve a phase shift of any multiple of 3&deg; with an accuracy of &plus;/&minus;1&deg;. What this accuracy means is that a number of regeneration units can be eliminated. In one embodiment, pulse trains were recovered when transmitted over 2500 miles without regeneration along the way. Note that in one embodiment a 180&deg; phase shift is achieved by cascading two 90&deg; phase shift modules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, this accuracy is achieved through the utilization of only one control voltage, which requires only one pair of wires for each module. The result is that the subject systems succeed in reducing the number of control wires by 50%, and consequently the amount of interference among the seven phase shifting modules inside the phase shifter. Additionally, there is no unwanted error due to the transitioning of the control voltage because there is only one control voltage utilized, versus two in the traditional design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment the phase shifting modules utilize PIN diodes as switching devices to reroute the microwave clock and data streams, which fall under microwave frequency regime, to change its propagation length and therefore its propagation delay and phase. In a preferred embodiment, a single control line is utilized to carry a bipolar control voltage to switch the signal state of the phase shifting module. For instance, a positive control voltage for one single phase state, and a negative signal control voltage for the other signal phase state causes the signals to go through one of two paths through the phase shifting module. For each signal path in the phase shifting element, there are two PIN diodes, a resistor and a capacitor, in its simplest form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Thus, each phase shifting module comprises two signal paths of different length to provide a predetermined value or difference. The microwave input signal is switched between the two paths to obtain the desired phase shift. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment for each phase shifting module there is one DC blocking capacitor for the input and one for the output, with the control voltage introduced through an RF choke in one end and returned to ground through another RF choke in the other end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the PIN diodes can be completely turned on by forward-biasing with a forward current and turned off by reverse-biasing it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The result is that a simplified physical arrangement is achieved for the control lines to an individual phase shifting module, which minimizes the interference of the DC control lines with respect to the phase shifting performance. Moreover, since the control voltage is switched from positive to negative in a single continuous sweep without complicated crossover control circuits, smooth phase shifting can be achieved. This is because there is only one rise and fall time for the control voltage. Since there is no interplay between the rise and fall times of two separate control voltages as was the case in prior art systems, timing and phase errors associated with the non-synchronized voltages are eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The result of cascading the phase shifting modules is that for an equivalent to a 5 GHz microwave system, a more precise ultimate phase shifting result is achieved. Being able to phase-adjust the data pulse train vis-&agrave;-vis the clock pulses in such a precise manner permits the removal of regeneration units normally thought to be required in long-haul fiber optic cable systems. Being able to adjust data pulse train vis-&agrave;-vis the clock pulses in such a precise manner in a 10 gigabit/sec system provides a key functional capability to &ldquo;long haul&rdquo; optical systems such that the distance between regeneration is now substantially increased. For instance, in a 2500 mile length of cable, it has been found that one needs only a preamplifier and squaring circuit at the receive end, followed by the ability to phase shift the recovered pulse train to a 3&deg; accuracy which maintains acceptably low error rates in the data transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In summary, an improved accuracy phase shifter having cascaded phase shifting modules is provided for phase shifting a pulse train which rather than utilizing two pairs of control voltage leads for each phase shifting module, utilizes only one pair to significantly reduce the interference between the cascaded phase shifting modules. The result is that the phase of an incoming pulse train can be shifted from 0 to 360&deg; in 3&deg; increments with &plus;/&minus;1&deg; accuracy. When the subject phase shifter is utilized in fiber-optic cable networks operating at 10 gigabits/sec. for correcting phase offsets of data streams transmitted over ultra long distances, the utilization of the subject phase shifter plays a part in obviating the necessity of having regeneration units every 70 to 100 miles, thus permitting error-free transmission over as many as 2500 miles without the requirement for regeneration.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in a typical long haul fiber optic network a head-end system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> transmits data over an optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a regeneration unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which amplifies the signal on its way to a distant receiver <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The regeneration unit amplifies the optical signal and to a certain extent regenerates it so that anomalies, artifacts and dispersion along the fiber optic cable are eliminated. For some long haul applications a number of regeneration units, here illustrated at 14&prime; and 14&Prime;, are interposed along the length of the fiber optic cable in order to assure the robust receipt of the data from the head-end system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As mentioned hereinbefore, 10 gigabit/sec. data rates are achievable over fiber optic links, but only if the received data streams are intact and correlatable with a simultaneously transmitted clock pulse train. Typically, the data stream is transmitted over a data fiber, whereas the clock pulse train is transmitted over a clock fiber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Due to the degradation associated with the long path lengths it is necessary to space the regeneration units at 70-100 mile intervals along the cable in order to reestablish the correspondence between the data stream and the accompanying timing pulses. Regeneration at so frequent an interval oftentimes precludes the use of this type of high data-rate system for long haul applications and most especially those that are over 2000 miles in length. It is not that the data cannot be recovered at each regeneration unit, but rather the cost of the regeneration and the reliability of the regeneration in long-haul applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As will be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an original pulse train <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has well-shaped pulses which are transmitted over the aforementioned data fiber. However, with distance, the original pulse trains are distorted as illustrated at <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, usually due to dispersion and other artifacts. As can be seen, a waveform in <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has been distorted such that the leading and the trailing edges of the original pulses are now rounded. Upon squaring by a photo detector as illustrated <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> it may be that the original position of the leading edges <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the original pulse train will be displaced as illustrated by 26&prime; such that a phase offset as illustrated at 30 occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Since the data rate assumed is 10 gigabits/sec., and since this is equivalent to about 5 GHz in terms of microwave theory, then the phase offset can be described in terms of phase angles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, in a long-haul fiber optic application a data fiber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is coupled to a filter <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> at the receive end which is then coupled to a detector <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and thence to a phase shifter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It is the purpose of the phase shifter to shift the recovered data stream, here illustrated at <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, in the direction illustrated by arrow <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> such that the leading edge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of a pulse <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is aligned with the leading edge <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of a clock pulse <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It is therefore the purpose of phase shifter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to shift the incoming data stream in time to match the clock pulse stream so that the data can be appropriately recovered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> One such system is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> in which an input data stream <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is applied to a multiplexer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and thence to a data modulation system <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> coupled to a laser source <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which outputs a pulse train <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> onto a data fiber <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. A reference clock modulator <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is coupled to the data modulation system for the timing of the outgoing data pulses and also to a laser source <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> such that the output on clock is a pulse train <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> on clock fiber <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, at the receive end data pulse train <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is amplified by a preamplifier <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which is in turn coupled to an optical filter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and thence to a photo detector <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> which is in turn coupled to an amplifier <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> that is coupled to a data recovery system <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which outputs the recovered data stream as illustrated at <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The clock pulse train <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is likewise amplified by a preamplifier <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and is coupled to its optical filter <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and thence to the corresponding photo detector <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> where it is amplified at <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and applied to a signal processor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which performs an equalizer function. The output of signal processor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is applied to a clock recovery system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, which has two inputs. The first input is the output of amplifier <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and also the output of signal processor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. What is applied to the data recovery system <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is a phase angle by which the incoming data stream is to be shifted in order to align the data pulse train with the recovered clock pulse train so that the data stream <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> will contain few errors and be as robust as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, it is of course possible to provide a large number of phase shifting modules here illustrated at <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> so that the incoming data can be phase shifted through a full 360&deg; at 3&deg; increments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Rather than providing so many small phase shifts which result in a large number of cascaded modules, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> the incoming data pulse train may be shifted in the indicated increments as illustrated at <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Central to the ability to efficiently provide phase shifting for the high data-rate signal, is the requirement that each of the phase shift modules provide phase shifts of exceedingly precise accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> prior art phase shifting module <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has two different paths of varying length through it as illustrated as by Path <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and Path <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The incoming pulse train <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> can be transmitted over Path <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or Path <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in accordance with the application of two control voltages here illustrated as VC<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and VC<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>through respective inductors <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The control voltages are utilized to bias respective diodes <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> with the ground return in each case being respectively inductors <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. As will be appreciated in each of the paths are capacitors <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> on the inputs and capacitors <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> on the outputs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> As can be seen by the chart illustrated at <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> for different polarities of the control voltages either Path <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on or Path <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As mentioned hereinbefore, when such phase shifting elements or modules is cascaded together to provide the required phase shift, the accuracy obtainable in such a system is less than 12&deg;. This is due primarily to cross talk between the various control voltage leads for each of the phase shifting modules or elements utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Additionally, as described hereinabove, the rise and fall times of the control voltages are not simultaneous when trying to either turn Path <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or Path <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on. The result is a critical unpredictability, which significantly degrades the phase shift accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, if the phase shift modules or elements are as illustrated at <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, then as can be seen with a first path <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> goes through a predetermined length element <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> through a diode <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, another predetermined element length <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, a capacitor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and an identical predetermined element length <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, and then through a diode <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and a like predetermined element length <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. With resistor <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> connected as illustrated, Path <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> corresponds with a predetermined path length, which is the sum of all the predetermined length elements and therefore corresponds to a predetermined delay and phase shift. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Path <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, here illustrated at <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> includes predetermined path length element <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> in each of the two legs as illustrated, through diodes <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and through different predetermined path element lengths illustrated here at <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, with the path including capacitor <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It will be noted that the incoming signal or pulse train <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> passes through a predetermined length element <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and a capacitor <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> and forms the input to the bridge, whereas the output is through capacitor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and another predetermined path length element <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Control of which path the incoming signal goes along is controlled by a control voltage VC through an inductor <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to a node <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>, with the return path being through inductor <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> to ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, what is shown is a top view of a phase shifting unit in which the individual phase shift modules or elements are laid out. As will be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, each of the phase shifting modules or elements <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> have internal path links which delay the incoming signal at an input node by respectively 6&deg;, 46&deg;, 3&deg;, 90&deg;, 12&deg; and 24&deg;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Combinations of these shifts can shift an incoming signal by as much as 180&deg; in 3&deg; increments. If a fall 360&deg; capability is required this can be accomplished by multiple 90&deg; phase shifts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> While the phase shifts of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> differ from those previously described, it will be appreciated that there are many combinations of cascaded phase shifts can produce the intended result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In operation, the subject phase shifter operates as a microwave phase shifter using PIN diodes and switching devices to reroute the microwave signal to change its propagation path length, and therefore its propagation delay and phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment utilizes a single control line to carry a bipolar control voltage to switch the signal state, with the control signal being either positive for one signal phase state or negative for the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> For each of the signal paths in each phase shifting module, there are two PIN diodes and a resistor and a capacitor in its simplest form. Thus each phase shifter comprises two signal paths of different length of a predetermined value or difference. The microwave signals are switched between the two paths to obtain the desired phase shift. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> There is one DC blocking capacitor for the input and one for the output, with the control voltage being introduced through an RF choke in one end and returned to ground through an RF choke in the other end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> It is noted that a PIN diode can be completely turned on by forward-biasing it with a forward current of more than 10 mA. The voltage drop across a forward-biased PIN diode is approximately 0.6V. A PIN diode can be completely turned off by reverse-biasing it at more than 2.5V. With the circuit arrangement illustrated, a forward bias of 10 mA is achieved in one path, while more than a reverse 2.5V bias voltage is provided in the other path. When there is a &plus;12V applied to the control line, the PIN diodes on one path are forward-biased, with 10 mA current passing through them. The voltage drops are 0.6V each for both PIN diodes, and 10.8V across the resistor. On the other path, there is a 6V reverse bias for each of the PIN diodes, and a 0V across the resistor since there is no current passing through it. The microwave signal is, of course, propagated on the ON path. For the alternate path, the situation is exactly reversed for a &minus;12V on the control line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The advantages of the subject system are that the physical arrangement of the control lines is simplified in a microwave system and minimizes the interference of the DC control line to the microwave performance. Moreover, since the control voltage is switched from positive to negative in a single continuous sweep, without complicated crossover control circuits, smooth phase shifting can be achieved without any circuit arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The result is an exceedingly precise phase shift of 3&deg; resolution with an accuracy of &plus;/&minus;1&deg;. The result is that these phase shift modules, when utilized in a phase shifter can be used to completely eliminate regeneration units in a fiber optic cable network. Working at 6 GHz, the subject phase shifter unit together with the necessary control electronics and connectors can be packed inside a housing of nominal dimensions of 3 inch&times;3 inch&times;&frac12; inch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Having now described a few embodiments of the invention, and some modifications and variations thereto, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the foregoing is merely illustrative and not limiting, having been presented by the way of example only. Numerous modifications and other embodiments are within the scope of one of ordinary skill in the art and are contemplated as falling within the scope of the invention as limited only by the appended claims and equivalents thereto. </paragraph>
