<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This present invention relates to encapsulated-lens reflective sheeting. More particularly, the invention relates to retroreflective sheeting containing an improved binder layer composition. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Encapsulated-lens retroreflective sheeting, also known as high intensity sheeting, is typically sold for use as traffic signs and other uses which need to be outdoor durable for a minimum of ten years. Therefore, highly durable and cost-effective materials must be used. Acrylic face films or cover films are desirable for this type of sheeting for several reasons, including their excellent durability, their receptiveness to highly durable screen printing inks, and their relatively low cost to produce. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For retroreflective performance, the sheeting also includes metallized glass microspheres which need to have an air gap above them, and the air gap is produced by encapsulation. In one embodiment, such sheeting may be prepared by the following procedure: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> (1) Glass microspheres are embedded into a substrate which comprises a polyolefin such as a low-density polyethylene layer which is coated onto a polyester film. The substrate is heated to soften the polyolefin as the glass beads are brought into contact with and partially embedded into the polyolefin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> (2) The beaded polyolefin/polyester substrate is placed in a vacuum metalizer, and the surface containing the partially exposed glass beads is metallized with aluminum whereby a coating of aluminum is deposited on the exposed surface of the glass beads and the exposed surface of the polyolefin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> (3) A base sheet is prepared by coating a binder film comprising a thermoplastic polymer onto a release liner, and thereafter transferring the coated film by heat onto a support layer such as a 1 or 2-mil thick vinyl or polymethyl methacrylate layer which has been deposited on a casting substrate such as paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> (4) The base sheet is then thermally bonded to the exposed aluminum coated surface of the glass beads by bringing the thermoplastic polymer surface into contact with the glass beads at an elevated temperature with mild pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> (5) The glass beads are removed from the polyolefin/polyester substrate by stripping the substrate from the base sheet. It is desired that the glass beads preferentially adhere to the thermoplastic polymer. The casting substrate (paper) may then be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> (6) The bead-containing base sheet with support layer is placed in contact with a preformed cover sheet, and the cover sheet is thermally laminated to the binder layer of the base sheet by embossing the laminate from the binder layer side with an embossing die having a predetermined pattern so that the embossing procedure results in the formation of a network of narrow intersecting bonds that extend between the cover sheet and the binder layer at the point of contact between the bonds and the cover sheet as the embossing pattern forces the cushion coat through the spaces between the beads and into contact with the cover sheet in selected areas. Thus, the cover sheet is thermally laminated to the cushion coat only in the bridge areas where the raised surface of an embossing die has been presses against the cushion coat and support layer. The glass beads in the bridge areas are surrounded by binder. At least a monomolecular air gap is formed between the beads and the cover sheet in the hermetically sealed areas formed by the network of intersecting bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> (7) An adhesive coated liner optionally can then be brought into contact with and laminated to the support layer which is beneath the binder layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The polymer materials which are selected for the binder film must comprise materials that are capable of retrieving the metalized glass beads from the polyolefin/polyester substrate, and materials which are also capable of firmly adhering to the cover film. These materials must also sufficiently flow when subjected to elevated temperature and pressure to perform these tasks, while at the same time they must be durable and dimensionally stable under conditions to which traffic signs may be exposed over extended periods of outdoor use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It has been difficult to find individual thermoplastic resins for use as binder layers which are capable of both retrieving the metalized glass beads and forming permanent bonds to the cover film through heat lamination. Many resins which retrieve beads have poor adhesion to certain cover films such as acrylic films, and many resins which form permanent bonds to acrylic films through heat lamination are inefficient at retrieving beads. Some materials such as polycarbonates are capable of retrieving beads and adhering to acrylic films, but polycarbonates require a high processing temperature which is generally too high to be useful as a binder film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Polyurethanes have been used as binder layers in retroreflective sheeting. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,897,136 (Bailey) and 5,064,272 (Bailey) disclose the use of a polyurethane resin as the binder film in encapsulated-lens retroreflective sheeting. The polyurethane binder film has a melt flow index of 750 or lower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,882,771 (Klein et al) describes a conformable embossable enclosed lens retroreflective sheeting which contains a bead bond layer comprising an aminoplast crosslinked polymer containing urethane groups. Prior to cross linking, the polymer has a glass transition temperature of less than about 0&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,520 (Nagaoka et al) relates to supported encapsulated-lens retroreflective sheeting. Binder materials for the glass microspheres are suggested as a binder materials having low glass transition temperatures (e.g., &minus;20&deg; C. or lower). Thermoplastic polyurethanes are described as being especially useful as the binder material, and mixtures of polymeric materials also are suggested as useful binder materials. For example, a vinyl chloride/acetate copolymer is described as being mixed with a polyurethane polymer to provide a flexible binder material. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The vinyl chloride copolymers which are useful in the present invention are often referred to in the art as solution grade vinyl chloride copolymers. In the broadest sense, the vinyl chloride copolymers are copolymers of vinyl chloride with at least one other vinyl comonomer. The term copolymer as used herein includes copolymers of vinyl chloride with two or more comonomers, and thus includes terpolymers. In one embodiment, the vinyl chloride copolymers are prepared by copolymerizing vinyl chloride with at least one vinyl comonomer containing at least one carboxylic acid group (&mdash;COOH) or sulfonic acid group (&mdash;SO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>H).

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The thermoplastic polyurethanes which are useful in the film-forming mixtures used to prepare the binder layer can be any of a variety of cross linkable polyurethanes prepared by combining one or more polyols with one or more organic polyisocyanates. As used herein, crosslinkable means that the polymer has functional groups capable of reacting with a crosslinking agent. Preferably, the polyurethane has pendant hydroxyl groups free for reaction with a crosslinking agent, although other functional groups are possible for crosslinking, such as isocyanate groups and carboxyl groups. In the method of the present invention, the functional groups are unprotected (i.e., unblocked), allowing crosslinking to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> A variety of polyols may be utilized in preparing the polyurethane. Also, mixtures of polyols can be used. The term &ldquo;polyol&rdquo; as used herein refers to polyhydric alcohols containing two or more hydroxyl groups. The polyol preferably has a hydroxyl functionality of 2-4 (i.e., diols, triols, tetraols). More preferably, the polyol is a diol, although higher functional polyols, such as triols and tetrols, can be used in combination with a diol. Most preferably, the polyol is a diol or mixture of diols and no higher functional polyols are used to prepare the polyurethane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The polyol can be a polyether polyol such as polytetramethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol; a polyester polyol such as the reaction product of adipic acid and neopentyl glycol or phthalic anhydride and hexanediol; an acrylic polyol; etc. In one embodiment, the polyol is a hydroxy-terminated polyester polyol prepared by polycondensation of an aliphatic or aromatic dicarboxylic acid and a molar excess of an aliphatic glycol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the polyol is a hydroxyl terminated polyol of the following formula: HO&mdash;&lsqb;R&mdash;O&mdash;C(O)&mdash;R&prime;&mdash;C(O)&mdash;O&mdash;R&mdash;O&mdash;&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>)H, wherein R is an aliphatic group having 2-10 carbon atoms, R&prime; is an aliphatic or aromatic group having up to 14 carbon atoms, and n is at least 2. This polyester diol is typically formed from one or more types of aliphatic or aromatic acids/esters and one or more types of aliphatic diols. For example, a polyester diol of the above formula can be prepared from an aromatic acid or ester such as isophthalic acid or dimethyl isophthalate (or mixture thereof), and a diol such as neopentyl glycol, 1,6-hexanediol, or 1,4-cyclohexane dimethanol (or mixture thereof. If both an aromatic and an aliphatic material are used, the weight percent of the aromatic material is generally less than that of the aliphatic material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The polyester diol, or other suitable polyol, preferably has a hydroxyl equivalent weight of about 90 to about 5000, more preferably about 200 to about 3000, and most preferably about 250-2000. The polyester diol, or other suitable polyol, preferably has an acid number of no greater than about 1.0, and more preferably no greater than about 0.7. Acid number can be determined in accordance with ASTM D 4662-93. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> An example of a commercially available polyester diol is FOMREZ 8056-146 from Witco Corp., Melrose Park, Ill. This resin is believed to contain neopentyl glycol at approximately 26 wt-%, 1,6-hexanediol at approximately 29 wt-%, adipic acid/ester at approximately 33 wt-%, and isophthalic acid/ester at approximately 12 wt-%. Other polyester diols are commercially available under the trade designations FOMREZ 55-112 (believed to contain approximately 47 wt-% neopentyl glycol and approximately 53% adipic acid/ester) and FOMREZ 8066-120 (believed to contain approximately 49 wt-% hexanediol, approximately 33 wt-% adipic acid/ester, and approximately 18 wt-% isophthalic acid/ester) from Witco Corp, as well as LEXOREZ from Inolex Chemical Company, Philadelphia, Pa., and RUCOFLEX from Ruco Polymer Corp., Hicksville, N.Y. It should be understood that blends or mixtures of such diols can be used in preparation of the polyurethane used in the film-forming mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A variety of triols may be utilized in the preparing the polyurethane. Suitable triols include, but are not limited to, polyether triols such as polypropylene oxide triol, polyester triols other than polycaprolactone triols, and simple triols such as trimethylolpropane and glycerol, and mixtures thereof. Preferably the hydroxyl groups in the triol are primary in order to facilitate crosslinking of the resultant polymer. Examples of triols include those commercially available under the trade designations FOMREZ 1066 (trimethylolpropane, hexanediol, and adipate) from Witco Corp., TONE 0305 (a polycaprolactone triol) from Union Carbide Corp., New Milford, Conn., and RUCOFLEX F-2311 from Ruco Polymer Corp. It should be understood that these materials could be used as blends or mixtures with other polyols to achieve a Tg of less than about 0&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Other polyester polyols are available from Miles Industrial Chemical Division of Miles Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa. under the general designations Desmophen and Multson. For example, Desmophen 670A-80 is available as a solution in n-butyl acetate (80% solids). It is believed to be derived from a mixture comprising isophthalic acid, 1,6-hexanediol, trimethylol propane and phthalic and or phthalic acid anhydride, and is characterized as having an equivalent weight of about 500, an acid number of 2.0 maximum, and a hydroxyl number of about 104 to about 112. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Tetrafunctional or higher alcohols such as pentaerythritol may also be useful polyols. Other useful polyols are taught by E. N. Doyle in &ldquo;The Development and Use of Polyurethane Products,&rdquo; McGraw-Hill, 1971. If a triol and higher functional polyol is used, the NCO:OH stoichiometry will need to be adjusted accordingly, although this would be understood by one of skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A wide variety of polyisocyanates may be utilized in preparing the polyurethane. &ldquo;Polyisocyanate&rdquo; means any organic compound that has two or more reactive isocyanate (&mdash;NCO) groups in a single molecule that can be aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic, or a combination thereof. This definition includes diisocyanates, triisocyanates, tetraisocyanates, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, diisocyanates are utilized. These isocyanate groups can be bonded to aromatic or cycloaliphatic groups. Most preferably aliphatic isocyanates, including cycloaliphatic isocyanates, are used to improve weathering and eliminate yellowing. Useful diisocyanates include, but are not limited to, those selected from the group consisting of bis(4-isocyanotocyclohexyl) methane (H<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>MDI, available from Bayer Corp., Pittsburgh, Pa.), diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI, available from Bayer Corp., Pittsburgh, Pa.), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI, available from Huels America, Piscataway, N.J.), toluene 2,4-diisocyanate (TDI, available from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.), hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI, available from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.), m-tetramethylxylene diisocyanate (TMXDI, available from Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, Wis.), and 1,3-phenylene diisocyanate. It is also noted that mixtures of diisocyanates can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The stoichiometry of the polyurethane reaction is based on a ratio of equivalents of isocyanate to equivalents of polyol. The overall preferred NCO:OH ratio for the polyurethane is less than 1:1 to allow for residual hydroxyl groups in the resultant polyurethane. More preferably, the NCO:OH ratio is about 0.8-0.99 to 1. Most preferably, the NCO:OH ratio is about 0.91-0.96 to 1. It will be understood by one of skill in the art that this ratio will vary depending upon the synthetic sequence when using triol(s) and/or tetrol(s). This is accomplished typically by varying the amount of isocyanate such that gellation is avoided and a soluble product is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> A catalyst may be added to the reaction mixture of polyol(s) and polyisocyanate(s) to promote the reaction. Catalysts for reacting polyisocyanate and active hydrogen containing compounds are well known in the art. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,495,061 (Mayer et al.). Preferred catalysts include organometallic compounds and amines. The organometallic compounds may be organotin compounds such as dimethyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin dilaurate, and dibutyltin dimercaptide. The preferred catalyst is dibutyltin dilaurate. The catalyst is used in an amount effective to promote the reaction. Preferably, it is used in an amount of about 0.01-2% by weight (wt-%), based on the total weight of solids. More preferably, the catalyst is used in an amount of about 0.01-0.03 wt-% based on solids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The polymer may be prepared in the presence or absence of a solvent. Preferably, it is prepared in the presence of one or more organic solvents. Examples of suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, amyl acetate, aromatic hydrocarbons and mixtures thereof, butanone, butoxy ethoxyethyl acetate, 2-ethoxyethyl acetate, cyclohexanone, dioxane, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, xylene, and/or mixtures thereof. Preferred solvents are xylene, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, and mixtures thereof. The polyurethane reaction mixture preferably includes about 30-75 wt-% total solids, and more preferably about 40-55 wt-% total solids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> An extensive description of some of the useful techniques for preparing polyurethanes can be found in J. H. Saunders and K. C. Frisch, &ldquo;Polyurethanes: Chemistry and Technology,&rdquo; Part II, Interscience (New York 1964), pages 8-49, and in the various references cited therein. The component polyol(s) and polyisocyanate(s) may be reacted simultaneously or stepwise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Useful thermoplastic polyurethanes are available commercially. For example, Irostic 9815 is available from Huntsman Polyurethanes and is believed to be an aromatic polyester urethane polymer. An example of an aliphatic polyurethane is Q-thane AP3429 available from K. J. Quinn and Co. Inc. which is believed to be the reaction product of 1,1-methylene bis(4-isocyanatocyclohexene adipic acid, isophthalic acid and 1,4-butene diol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The film-forming mixtures used to form the binder layer also contain an aminoplast resin as a crosslinking agent. Aminoplast resins are nitrogen-rich polymers containing nitrogen in the amino form (&mdash;NH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) and they are formed by the reaction of an aldehyde and an amine or urea. Example of aminoplast resins include urea-formaldehyde resins, melamine-formaldehyde resins, glycoluril-formaldehyde resins, benzoguanamine-formaldehyde resins etc. Although not wishing to be held to any theory, it is believed that these resins contribute to the high impact resistance of the crosslinked polyurethane and to the weatherability of the binder layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the aminoplast resin is a melamine-formaldehyde resin selected from alkylated melamine-formaldehyde resins, imino melamine-formaldehyde resins, and mixed ether and butylated melamine-formaldehyde resins. </paragraph>

In other embodiments, the above sheeting may also comprise a support layer underlying the base sheet, and, optionally, (F) a pressure sensitive adhesive layer underlying the support layer, and, optionally, (G) a release layer underlining the adhesive layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The transparent microsphere lenses <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> utilized in the retroreflective sheeting of the present invention may be characterized as having average diameters in a range of from about 30 to about 120 microns, and more often in a range from about 40 to about 80 microns. The index of refraction of the microsphere lenses is generally in the range of from about 1.8 to about 2.0, more typically is in the range of from about 1.90 to about 1.95, and most often between about 1.92 to about 1.93. Glass microspheres are typically used although ceramic microspheres such as those made by sol/gel techniques can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The cover sheet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> generally may be a single layer or multiple layers, and may comprise various thermoplastic polymers including acrylic polymer such as polymethylmethacrylate; vinyl polymers such as PVC and vinyl acrylic copolymers, or polyurethanes such as aliphatic polyether urethanes. The cover sheet is prepared prior to conversion into an encapsulated bead retroreflective product by extruding the polymer of the cover sheet onto a polymer coated paper casting sheet or onto a polymer casting sheet. Casting sheet products are well known to the industry and supplied by companies such as Felix Schoeller Technical Papers, Pulaski, N.Y., S. D. Warren of Newton Center, Mass. and Ivex Corporation of Troy, Ohio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The support layer or film <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> may be any one of a number of polymeric materials such as extruded acrylic films, cast vinyl films, calendared vinyl films and polyurethane films. In one embodiment, the material used in the support layer is an acrylic film. A support layer is not a product requirement, but the layer is often included in the retroreflective sheetings to provide support to the structures <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> particularly during processing and manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Adhesive layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is often included in the sheeting of the invention in addition to those layer discussed above. For example, an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be applied to the support layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to serve a functional purpose such as subsequently adhering the sheeting to a substrate. Conventional pressure sensitive adhesives such as acrylic-based adhesives or heat- or solvent-activated adhesives are typically used and may be applied by conventional procedures. For example, a preformed layer of adhesive on a carrier web or release liner <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be laminated to the support layer <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Conventional release liners <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be utilized in the formation of the retroreflective sheeting of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The encapsulated-lens retroreflective sheeting of the present invention can be made by procedures normally used in the industry. U.S. patents describing encapsulated-lens retroreflective sheeting include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,190,178, 4,025,159 and 6,054,208, and the disclosures of these patents with regard to the process for preparing the encapsulated-lens retroreflective sheeting is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the encapsulated-lens retroreflective sheeting of the present invention may be prepared by a general procedure which may be described as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> (1) Glass microspheres are embedded into a substrate which comprises a polyolefin such as a low-density polyethylene layer which is coated onto a polyester film. The substrate is heated to soften the polyolefin as the glass beads are brought into contact with and partially embedded into the polyolefin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> (2) The beaded polyolefin/polyester substrate is placed in a vacuum metalizer, and the surface containing the partially exposed glass beads is metallized with aluminum whereby a coating of aluminum is deposited on the exposed surface of the glass beads and the exposed surface of the polyolefin. (</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> 3) A base sheet is prepared by coating a binder film comprising a thermoplastic polymer onto a release liner, and thereafter transferring the coated film by heat onto a support layer such as a 1 or 2-mil thick vinyl or polymethyl methacrylate layer which has been deposited on a casting substrate such as paper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> (4) The base sheet is then thermally bonded to the exposed aluminum coated surface of the glass beads by bringing the thermoplastic polymer surface into contact with the glass beads at an elevated temperature with mild pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> (5) The glass beads are removed from the polyolefin/polyester substrate by stripping the substrate from the base sheet. It is desired that the glass beads preferentially adhere to the thermoplastic polymer. The casting substrate (paper) may then be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> (6) The bead-containing base sheet with support layer is placed in contact with a preformed cover sheet, and the cover sheet is thermally laminated to the binder layer of the base sheet by embossing the laminate from the binder layer side with an embossing die having a predetermined pattern so that the embossing procedure results in the formation of a network of narrow intersecting bonds that extend between the cover sheet and the binder layer at the point of contact between the bonds and the cover sheet as the embossing pattern forces the cushion coat through the spaces between the beads and into contact with the cover sheet in selected areas. Thus, the cover sheet is thermally laminated to the cushion coat only in the bridge areas where the raised surface of an embossing die has been presses against the cushion coat and support layer. The glass beads in the bridge areas are surrounded by binder. At least a monomolecular air gap is formed between the beads and the cover sheet in the hermetically sealed areas formed by the network of intersecting bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> (7) An adhesive coated liner optionally can then be brought into contact with and laminated to the support layer which is beneath the binder layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The retroreflective sheeting of the present invention generally is useful for imparting retroreflectivity in various applications such as license plates, traffic signs, pavement markings, construction zone markings, etc. More particularly, the retroreflective sheeting of the present invention can be used in applications such as highway signs, including contoured signs, commercial signs, fleet markings and fleet graphics, building graphics, temporary and permanent traffic control devices, signs and printed decals. Other applications of the sheetings of the present invention include vehicle markings, computer cut graphics, die cut graphics, pin-stripping for vehicles, boats etc., decorating applications on various articles such as notebooks, boat tags, back packs, boats, cars, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> The following examples A to D illustrate the preparation of the retroreflective sheeting of the invention. Examples Control 1 and Control 2 illustrate the preparation and properties of examples of sheeting which do not contain the binder layer specified herein. Unless otherwise indicated in the examples and elsewhere in the specification and claims, all parts and percentages are by weight, temperatures are in degrees celsius, and pressure is at or near atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> EXAMPLE Control-1 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Glass microspheres with a refractive index of 1.93 were flooded onto a polyethylene-PET carrier which was heated to about 90&deg; C. A monolayer of beads affixed to the softened polyethylene surface, while excess beads fell off of the carrier. The web was then post-heated to approximately 115&deg; C. to further soften the polyethylene and draw the beads deeper into it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In a vacuum chamber, aluminum was deposited over the exposed portion of the monolayer of glass beads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Onto a 90 pound siliconized release liner was cast from solvent a binder layer at approximately 2-mil dry thickness blended from the following.

<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The dried binder layer was then heat laminated at 115&deg; C. and at approximately 60 psi and 20 FPM to a 2-mil thick acrylic sheet support layer which had been extruded onto a PET carrier. The 90 pound siliconized liner was then removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The monolayer of metalized glass beads was contacted by the binder layer on support layer-PET carrier at 115&deg; C. and approximately 60 psi and 10 FPM. While still warm, the polyethylene-PET was stripped away leaving the beads behind in the binder layer with the non-metalized side exposed. After cooling, the PET carrier was removed from behind the support layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> A transparent acrylic cover film was adhered to the bead bearing surface of the binder layer along a network of interconnecting lines forming sealed cells within which the lenses are encapsulated and have an air interface. This sealing was done with a heated embossing roller whose surface temperature was 145&deg; C. at a speed of 13 FPM and 60 psi setting for nip pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The seal strength of the sample was sufficient to prevent the separation of the cover film from the binder layer. Attempts to break the support-binder layer away from the cover film ceased upon reaching a cell wall. Sawing through the binder bridge by placing a razor knife between the cover film and binder-support layer was extremely difficult and the usual result was for the knife to exit the sample either by cutting up through the cover film or down through the support layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The sample&apos;s coefficient of reflectivity measured at an observation angle of 0.2&deg; and entrance angle of &minus;40&deg; in accordance with ASTM E-810 was 296. The whiteness of the film by a Cap Y colormetric reading in accordance with ASTM E309, E1347 and E1349 was 27.9. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> After 2200 hours of exposure in a Carbon Arc weather-o-meter in accordance with ASTM G23, method 1, Type E the sample retained 74% of its&apos; initial coefficient of retroreflection and had a Cap Y of 27.6. Microscopic inspection of the weathered sample revealed black spots on the beads upper surface. These spots are believed to be residue from degraded binder layer and are attributable to a large portion of the reflectivity drop. </paragraph>
