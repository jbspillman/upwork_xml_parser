<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to the field of wireless digital communication systems and, more particularly, to wireless digital communication systems that support adaptive modulation and coding schemes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Wireless communication systems, such as cellular, use a wireless link comprised of a modulated radio frequency (RF) signal to transmit data between sender and receiver. Since RF bandwidth is a scarce resource, various signal processing techniques have been developed for increasing efficiency of the usage of the available RF bandwidth. An example of such signal processing techniques is the IS-95 promulgated by the telecommunication industry association (TIA). The IS-95 standard, used primarily within cellular telecommunications systems, incorporates code division multiple access (CDMA) to carry out multiple communications simultaneously over the same bandwidth. In accordance with the IS-95 standard, data is transmitted over a RF link at a maximum data rate of 9.6 or 14.4 kbps for voice codec, or 64 kbps for data communication, depending on which rate set from a set of data rates is selected. Such data rates as specified by IS-95 may be suited for wireless cellular telephone systems if the typical communication involves the transmission of digitized voice or lower rate digital data such a facsimile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) of the Internet Society, the recognized authority for worldwide data network standards, has recently published its International Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) standard. The standard proposes so-called third generation (3G) and beyond (i.e., 3.5G, 4G etc.) data networks that include extensive mobile access by wireless, mobile nodes including cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), handheld computers, and the like. (See http://www.itu.int). The IMT-2000 standard adopts wideband direct sequence code division multiple access (W-CDMA) as a wireless access method for the proposed third generation and beyond networks and requires a maximum data rate of 144 kbps (vehicular), 384 kbps (pedestrian) or 2 Mbps (quasi-stational), depending on the environment in which wireless communication is carried out. Thus, in communication networks according to the IMT-2000 standard, communication services that require high data transmission rates, such as the multimedia communication service, are indeed feasible over RF links. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The recent phenomenal growth of Information Technology and the Internet creates a need for a high performance wireless Internet technology and has in fact promoted development of various data transmission technologies for wireless data services. One such technology is the adaptive data rate scheme in which a data rate is adaptively changed according to the receiver&apos;s RF link condition. One of the key requirements for wireless Internet is to maximize the data throughput in a given cell or sector. The adaptive data rate scheme optimizes data throughput on average by serving multiple data receivers simultaneously at maximum data rates that the receivers can accept given their RF link conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The adaptive data rate scheme is a unique technology in many aspects. Recognizing the characteristics peculiar to data services, such as traffic asymmetry and high tolerance to latency, the adaptive data rate scheme decouples data service from voice service. Two-way conversational speech requires strict adherence to symmetry on the downlink (forward link) and uplink (reverse link) traffic and is very delay sensitive. For instance, latencies above 100 ms are intolerable and make speeches unintelligible. It is also true that a relatively modest data rate is sufficient for high quality voice service. On the other hand, data services are characterized by heavy downlink traffic and light uplink traffic and have high tolerance to latency. For high-speed data downlinked at 1 Mbps, for example, 100 ms represents just 100 kb or 12.5 kbytes, and even latencies of a couple of seconds are hardly noticeable. The decoupling of voice and data services reduces design complexities of Physical Layer because it is relieved from difficult system load-balancing tasks, such as one for determining whether voice or data calls have higher priority. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To serve multiple receivers simultaneously at different data rates, the adaptive data rate scheme is usually implemented with time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme. TDMA scheme subdivides the available frequency band into one or several RF channels called &ldquo;frames.&rdquo; The frames are further divided into a number of physical channels called &ldquo;time slots.&rdquo; The adaptive data rate scheme takes advantage of the characteristics of the TDMA channel that data rate control is possible on each slot. Implementation of the adaptive data rate scheme requires measurement of a RF channel condition and determination of a maximum data rate that the RF channel can accept. For this and other useful purposes, at least one pilot burst is inserted into each time slot. Upon reception of the first pilot burst in each time slot, a receiver estimates the downlink channel condition and computes the maximum data rate that the estimated channel condition can support while maintaining a low error rate. The receiver then reports the calculated data rate to the sender. In order to transmit data to the receiver at the reported data rate, the sender selects a modulation scheme and a coding rate that can achieve data transmission at the reported data rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When there are multiple receivers requesting data, the sender needs to have a scheduling functionality (a scheduler) that determines the order in which the receivers are served. Various scheduling algorithms have been proposed and used, yet no algorithms have yet been standardized. Basically, these conventional algorithms try to achieve the same goal, i.e., maximizing the average data throughput. To achieve the goal, these algorithms are designed to serve receivers with better channel conditions more favorably. Thus, under these conventional algorithms, receivers with good channel condition are served first, and receivers with poor channel condition are served later. Also, while serving a receiver, if the receiver&apos;s channel condition deteriorates, some of these conventional algorithms stop serving the receiver and start serving another receiver with good channel condition to increase the average data throughput. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a simplified graphical representation showing implementation of the adaptive data rate scheme. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an access point (AP) 1 has three sets of data ready to be transmitted to three access terminals (AT) 2, 3 and 4, respectively. The ATs 2-4 have already measured their RF channel conditions based on the received pilot bursts and sent the AP <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> data rates that they can accept. Suppose that the AT 2 has the best channel condition among them, the AT 3 has the next best condition and the AT 4 is the last. Accordingly, the AT 2 is requesting the highest data rate among them, the AT 3 is requesting a lower data rate and the AT 4 is requesting the lowest data rate. According to the above conventional scheduling algorithms, the AT 2 is served first, the AT 3 is next, and the AT <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is last as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Other conventional scheduling algorithms are designed to serve ATs favorably whose channel conditions have recently improved. These algorithms assume that a drop in channel conditions is temporary, and stop serving ATs whose channel conditions just dropped until the channel conditions recover. More specifically, these algorithms send data to an AT that has the highest DRC/R, where DRC is the data rate requested by the AT in a given slot, and R is the average rate received by the AT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It will however be apparent to those skilled in the art that the above conventional scheduling algorithms are nothing but unfair to ATs with poor channel conditions. It may work satisfactorily if a relatively few number of ATs are requesting data. However, in a situation where a large number of ATs frequently request data, these algorithms will be busy serving those with good channel conditions, and those with poor channel conditions will be left unserved until their channel conditions improve. In other words, in a situation where a large number of ATs frequently request data, the algorithms provide discriminating service under which ATs are served only when their channel conditions are good. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides scheduling algorithms that guarantee minimum data transport service for even ATs with poor channel conditions. In the present invention, data-requesting ATs are divided into a number of AT groups according to their channel conditions. Also, a recurring sequence of time slots is defined on the TDMA channel and partitioned into a number of slot groups, where the number of slot groups is made larger than the number of AT groups. Slot assignment according to the present invention is a two-step process. First, in each sequence, the slot groups are assigned to the AT groups so that AT groups with better channel conditions will receive more slot groups. Second, in each AT group, the time slots assigned to the AT group are assigned to the individual ATs in the group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> More specifically, according to the present invention, a channel condition of each receiver is first measured. The receivers are divided into receiver groups according their channel conditions. The channel is partitioned into a recurring sequence of slots, and each sequence is further partitioned into a certain number of slot groups, which are allocated to the receiver groups. More slot groups may be allocated to the receiver groups having receivers with better channel conditions. Also, receivers in a group with better channel conditions may be assigned more slots from a slot group allocated to the group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The number of receivers admitted into a group may be restricted to a certain number. In order to keep constant the number of receivers in a group, at least one of upper and lower threshold levels of channel condition defining the group is changed as the number of receivers in the group changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In order to guarantee a service level to receivers in a group, as the number of receivers in the group increases or decreases, more or less slots are allocated to the group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The channel condition may be measured at a receiver based on a pilot symbol received from the sender. Alternatively, the channel condition may be measured at the sender based on data received from the receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention may find its application in the adaptive data rate scheme where a data rate for a receiver is adaptively changed according to the channel condition of the receiver.</paragraph>

According to these Internet protocols, each of the ATs, APs, servers and routers in the network has a unique address, called the IP address. To communicate digital data over the network, a sender or source node subdivides the data to be transmitted into &ldquo;IP packets.&rdquo; An IP packet includes communication control data, such as the IP addresses of the source node and the intended destination node, and other information specified by the protocol, and substantive data to be passed on to the destination node. A single communication of data may require multiple packets to be created and transmitted depending on the amount of data being communicated and other factors. The source node transmits each IP packet separately, and the packets are routed via intermediary routers in the network from the source node to the destination node. The packets do not necessarily travel to the destination node via the same route, nor do they necessarily arrive at the same time. This is accounted for by providing each packet with a sequence indicator as part of the packetizing process. The sequence indicators permit the destination node to reconstruct the packets in their original order even if they arrive in a different order and at different times, thus allowing the original data to be reconstructed from the packets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> For purposes of the present description, it is assumed the data network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> adheres to the IMT-2000 standards and specifications of the ITU for wireless, mobile access networks. The proposed third generation and beyond networks support IP based data communication, i.e., all data is communicated in digital form in IP packets via Internet addressing and routing protocols from end to end. Also, in the proposed third generation and beyond wireless networks, ATs are free to move within the network while remaining connected to the network and engaging in data communications with servers through the Internet. To support mobility of the ATs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the data network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> implements Mobile IP according to the Mobile standards, such as Mobile IP Version 4 (IPv4) and Mobile IP Version 6 (Pv6), proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram showing the constructions of the AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the AT <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> receives data in packets from the Internet and stores it in a data buffer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. The data buffer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> may store multiple sets of data simultaneously for multiple ATs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> that have requested the data. These sets of data are selectively supplied to an encoder <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> under instructions from an AP controller <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> which implements scheduling algorithms according to the present invention. The encoder <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> executes error coding on the data supplied from the data buffer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the error-coding scheme used by the channel coder <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is Turbo coding (Parallel concatenated Convolutional coding). It should however be appreciated that other Convolutional coding schemes such as Serial concatenated Convolutional coding may also be used. Convolutional codes are usually described using two parameters, a coding rate (R) and a constraint length (K). The coding rate (R) is expressed as a ratio of the length of data input into the encoder to the length of the coded data output from the encoder in a given encoding cycle. The constraint length (K) denotes the length of the Convolutional encoder, i.e., how many k-bit states are available to feed the combinatorial logic that produces the output symbol. The purpose of Convolutional coding is to improve the capacity of a channel by adding some carefully designed redundant information to the data being transmitted through the channel. Thus, the lower the coding rate (R) becomes, i.e., the more redundant information is added to the data, the more resilient the coded data becomes during its transmission against channel fading and other disturbances that cause transmission errors. In this embodiment, the encoder <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> executes Turbo coding at a coding rate of either &frac13; or &frac23;. It should be noted that these coding rates are exemplary and that Turbo coding may be executed at any other rates. Also, in this embodiment, the constraint length (K) is four (4), but, needless to say, it may be any other numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The coded data is then supplied to a modulator <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> for modulation. The modulator uses one of the three modulation schemes, QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), 8PSK (Phase Shift Keying) and 16QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) to modulate the coded data from the encoder <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Theoretically, if a signal energy to noise ratio (E/N) is sufficiently high, 8PSK has a spectral efficiency which is 1.5 times higher than that of QPSK, and 16QAM has a spectral efficiency which is two times higher than that of QPSK. But with respect to the BER (Bit Error Rate) performance, the order is reversed. 16QAM is least resilient against transmission errors and QPSK is most resilient among the three. In fact, to maintain the same BER, 16QAM needs a minimum E/N which is at least 2 dB higher than that needed by QPSK, and 8PSK needs a minimum E/N which is at least 1 dB higher than that of QPSK. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> With different combinations of the coding rates and the modulation schemes, various data rates can be achieved. The following Table 1 shows these combinations and the corresponding data rates. Please note that the maximum data rates as shown in Table 1 are those that can be achieved with the use of one of the MAC (Medium Access Control) channel as a data channel.

The data time-multiplexed with the pilot symbols is supplied to a transmitter <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and transmitted wirelessly to ATs over downlink channels. The constructions, arrangements and functionalities of the interleaver <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, the puncturer <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, the MUX <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> and the transmitter <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> are conventional and standard.

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The transmitter <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> uses the time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme as its main communication access scheme. In the time domain, a TDMA channel is partitioned into a sequence of frames each consisting of a plurality of time slots. One TDMA channel can be time-shared by multiple ATs which are assigned to given time slots. Under the TDMA scheme, it is possible to transmit data at a different data rate in each time slot. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a graphical representation of the downlink channel used by the transmitter <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and shows one of the TDMA frames of the channel. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, one frame consists of a plurality of time slots each having a length of 2,048 chips or 1.667 ms and two pilot symbols inserted therein. When there is no data to be sent, the only transmissions from the AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> over the downlink channel are those of the pilot symbols and periodic transmissions of control information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In an AT <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, the data and the pilot symbols are received by a receiver <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> and supplied to a de-multiplexer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> where the data and the pilot symbols are separated. The data is then processed back to the original form through an un-puncturer <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, a de-interleaver <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, a demodulator <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and a decoder <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, using the coding rate and the modulation scheme reported from the AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The pilot symbols are supplied to a channel condition detector <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>. When receiving the first of the two pilot symbols in each time slot, the channel condition detector <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> measures a channel condition, such as an SIR (signal to interference ratio), based on the received the pilot symbol and provides the channel condition information to an AT controller <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the channel condition detector <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> may measure other channel condition indicators, such as signal to noise ratio (SNR), signal to noise and interference ratio (SNIR) and signal energy to noise ratio (E/N). Alternatively, an error rate, such as a frame error rate (FER) or a bet error rate (BER), may be used as channel condition information. The AT controller <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> forwards the channel condition information to a transmitter <highlight><bold>159</bold></highlight>, which transmits the information wirelessly over an uplink channel to the AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> at every slot timing. In the AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the channel condition information is received by a receiver <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> and supplied to the AP controller <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. The AP controller <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> maps the received channel condition information to the data rate which the downlink channel can support for the channel condition at a given level of error performance. For instance, the AP controller <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> may have a table stored therein, such as Table 2 shown below. Table 2 shows ranges of SIRS, the corresponding maximum data rates and the combinations of coding rates and modulation schemes that achieve the corresponding data rates. Table 2 is prepared through experiments conducted to determine relationships between SIRs and maximum data rates that the SIRs can support while maintaining a predetermined error level. With the channel condition information reported from the AT <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, the AP controller <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> looks up Table 2 and determines a maximum data rate for the AT, and a combination of coding rate and modulation scheme that achieves the data rate.

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the AT controller <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> may have Table 2 to determine the data rate for itself. The maximum data rates may be represented by data rate control (DRC) numbers as shown in Table 2. There six DRC numbers are from 1 though 6 each corresponding to one data rate and one combination of coding rate and modulation scheme that achieves the data rate. Thus, looking up Table 2 with the channel condition information measured by the channel condition detector <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>, the AT controller <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> determines the data rate and sends the corresponding DRC number to the AP. The use of the DRC numbers may increase computational overhead on ATs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> but will significantly reduce communication overhead, compared to sending raw channel condition information, such as SIR. Please note that the block diagram as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is drawn, focusing on downlink data transmission. The AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the AT <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are, of course, capable of uplink data transmission. In fact, the AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> has a decoder, a demodulator and other functionalities, such as those shown in the AT <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, for reconstructing transmitted data. Similarly, the AT <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> has an encoder, a modulator and other functionalities, such as those shown in the AP <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for processing data for transmission. But detailed descriptions thereof are not necessary to a complete understanding and appreciation of the present invention and are therefore omitted from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A plurality of ATs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may request to receive data simultaneously. When the AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> has in the data buffer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> multiple sets of data to be distributed to different ATs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, scheduling of delivering data to the ATs becomes necessary. The present invention provides scheduling algorithms that guarantee minimum data transport service for even ATs with poor channel conditions. The conventional scheduling algorithms focus on maximizing average data throughput. Therefore, in a situation where a large number of ATs frequently request data, the conventional algorithms tend to serve ATs only when their channel conditions are good and leave ATs with poor channel conditions unserved until their channel conditions improve. In the present invention, data-requesting ATs are divided into a number (Ng1) of AT groups according to their channel conditions. Also, a recurring sequence of time slots is defined on the TDMA channel and partitioned into a number (Ng2) of slot groups, where Ng2 is made larger than Ng1. Generally, slot assignment according to the present invention is a two-step process. First, in each sequence, the slot groups are allocated to the AT groups so that AT groups with better channel conditions will receive more slot groups while each AT group will receive at least one slot group. Second, in each AT group, the time slots in a slot group allocated to an AT group are assigned to the individual ATs in the group. It should be noted that serving a collective of ATs as a whole and serving individual ATs are competing interests and cannot be achieved at the same time. An attempt to achieve one will necessarily compromise the other. The scheduling algorithms according to the present invention serve neither ATs as a whole nor individual ATs. The algorithms according to the present invention are designed to serve AT groups. By allocating more slot groups to AT groups with better channel conditions, the algorithms will optimize the overall data throughput. By allocating at least one slot group to each of AT groups with poor channel conditions, the algorithms guarantee the minimum service to ATs with poor channel conditions. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows simulation results obtained when implementation of the present invention is simulated. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the channel condition goes poorer from left to right on the horizontal axis. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, under the conventional algorithm, data throughput becomes almost zero when the channel condition is poor. Under the algorithm according to the present invention, although data throughput is slightly lower when the channel condition is good, it never goes down to zero even when the channel condition deteriorates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Now, preferred scheduling algorithms according to the present invention will be explained in detail. The AP controller 143 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) has a scheduler therein that implements the algorithms according to the present invention. Suppose that as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, nine ATs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (1-9) have requested data from the Internet, and the AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> has nine sets of data ready to be distributed to respective ATs 1-9. As explained above, AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> periodically sends out a pilot symbol. Upon reception of a pilot symbol, each AT sends back channel condition information to the AP. In this embodiment, the channel condition information comprised of an SIR measured at each AT. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing a preferred scheduling algorithm. The scheduling algorithm begins with Step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> where slot number (i) is made equal to 1. Then, the scheduler in the AP controller <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> groups ATs 1-9 according to their respective SIRs (Step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> shows respective SIRs of ATs 1-9. In grouping ATs 1-9, their SIRs are compared against two threshold values, 14 dB and 7 dB. ATs with SIRs lower than 7 dB are grouped in group III. ATs with SIRs between 7 and 14 dB are grouped in group II. ATs with SIRs higher than 14 db are grouped in group I. As a result, ATs 1-9 are grouped as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> from the AT with the highest SIR (AT 5) to the AT with the lowest SIR (AT 9). In this embodiment, ATs 1-9 are divided into three groups for simplicity. It should be noted that the number of groups is not limited to three. ATs 1-9 may be divided into any other numbers of groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The TDMA channel from the AP 140 is partitioned into a recurring sequence of consecutive time slots. Each sequence is further partitioned into slot groups, where the number of the slot groups in each sequence is made larger than the number of the AT groups, which is three in this embodiment. Also, at least one slot group is allocated to each AT group. Further, AT groups with good channel conditions receive more slot groups. In this embodiment, for simplicity, each slot sequence consists of four consecutive time slots. Thus, the number of the slot groups in one sequence is four, and each slot group consists of one slot. Also, in each slot sequence, two slots are assigned to group I, and one slot is assigned to each of groups II and III. Further more, the slots in one sequence are numbered from 1 though 4. Each AT group receives slots with the same numbers in each sequence. In this embodiment, it is predetermined that group I receives slot Nos. 1 and 3, group II receives slot No. 2, and group III receives slot No. 4. The slot allocation is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C, a</cross-reference> slot allocated to group I shows up every other slot. A slot assigned to each of groups II and III shows up every four slots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>A, in step 7-3, the scheduler selects one AT with the highest SIR in the group that has received slot (i) in a sequence. Again, slot (1) and slot (3) are assigned to group I. Slot (2) is assigned to group II. Slot (4) is assigned to group III. For instance, if i&equals;1, AT 5 or AT 6 is to be selected because they have the highest SIR, i.e., 20 dB, in group I. A selection between AT 5 and AT 6 may be made based on the lengths of data to be delivered to these ATs. The lengths of data can be obtained from the server <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). It may be practical to choose one of them requesting longer data over the other. In response to the selection made by the scheduler, the AP controller <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> first looks up its Table 2 and finds the coding rate and the modulation scheme that correspond to AT 5&apos;s SIR, i.e., 20 dB. The AP controller <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> accesses the data buffer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> and takes out data to be sent to AT 5 and supplies the data to the encoder <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Data taken out from the data buffer <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> has the length that can be sent in one time slot. The encoder <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> encodes the data at the coding rate found in Table 2 and provides the coded data to the modulator <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, where the coded data is modulated, using the modulation scheme also found in Table 2. The modulated data is then interleaved and punctured by the interleaver <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and the puncturer <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, and transmitted from the transmitter <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> to the AT 5, using slot (1) (Step 7-4). If the group that has received slot (i) is empty, slot (i) is made idle (Step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>), and no data is sent in slot (i). Next, the value of &ldquo;i&rdquo; is incremented (Step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>). If &ldquo;i&rdquo; indicates the last slot in a sequence, which is four in this embodiment (Step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>), &ldquo;i&rdquo; is returned to I (Step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>), and the scheduler moves to Step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the scheduler moves from Step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> directly to Step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In Step <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the scheduler receives a new set of SIRs from AT 1-9. With this new set of SIRS, the scheduler regroups the ATs (Step 7-2). Since the scheduler receives a new set of SIRs every slot timing, the regrouping is also conducted every slot timing. Thereafter, Steps 7-3 to 7-8 are repeated on the regrouped groups I, II and III. As result, ATs 1-9 are served in the order as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A selection of an AT in a group may be made at every slot timing or when service to the one previously selected is completed. For instance, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>C, ATs 5, 6 and 1 in group I are served sequentially one slot at a time. Instead of sequentially serving these ATs one slot at a time, service may provided to the ATs in such a manner that service is provided to one AT in the group, using all the slots allocated to the group, until all the requested data is sent to the one AT and that service is then provided to a next AT after service to the AT previously selected is completed. In such an arrangement, service should continue to be provided to one AT until it is completed even if the channel condition of the AT deteriorates during the course of transmitting data to the AT. </paragraph>

In the second embodiment, AT 1-9 are grouped based on weighted averages of their SIRs while an AT with the highest current SIR is served first in a group. An average SIR ({overscore (SIR)}) is calculated, using the following equation (1): </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference> is a flowchart showing the second embodiment of the scheduling algorithm according to the present invention. As in the first embodiment discussed above with FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>C, the scheduler schedules delivery of data to nine ATs 1-9. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, the processes equivalent to those already discussed with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> will not be explained here to avoid redundancy, and only the processes peculiar to the second embodiment will be explained. In Step <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, every slot timing, the scheduler receives new SIRs from the ATs 1-9 and calculates their averages, using the above equation (1). For each of ATs 1-9, equation (1) calculates a weighted average of a current SIR and an average SIR calculated one slot before. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>B, the column labeled &ldquo;{overscore (SIR)}<highlight><subscript>(t&minus;1)</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; shows average SIRs calculated one slot before. The column labeled &ldquo;SIR<highlight><subscript>(t)</subscript></highlight>&rdquo; shows the SIRs just received from ATs 1-9. In this second embodiment, the weight &ldquo;a&rdquo; in equation (1) is selected to be 0.9. Of course, the weight &ldquo;a&rdquo; may be any other numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Turning back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>A, based on the calculated average SIRs, the scheduler divides ATs 1-9 in three groups I, II and III (Step <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), using the threshold levels of 7 dB and 14 dB. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> shows the result of the grouping. In selecting an AT in a group (Step <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), the scheduler selects one with the highest current SIR(,) first. For instance, AT 6 or AT 1 is to be selected first in Group I; AT 3 or AT 4 is to be selected first in Group II; and the AT 2 is to be selected first in Group III. As a result, ATs 1-9 are served in the order as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The scheduling algorithm as discussed with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A, 8B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>C may be implemented on code division multiple access (CDMA) channels. CDMA spreads multiple data streams with different spread codes and thus can create multiple channels simultaneously over the same RF bandwidth. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>D, four CDMA channels are created among which two channels are allocated to group I, and one channel is allocated to each of group II and group III. Each CDMA channel is partitioned in slots, like a TDMA channel, so that a plurality of ATs can time-share a CDMA channel. ATs 1-9 grouped as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> are scheduled on the CDMA channels in the same manner as discussed with the flowchart of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> If a particular AT currently has an extremely low SIR, it may be preferable not to send data to the particular AT but optionally send data to another AT, using the slots assigned to the particular AT. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>A, AT 1-9 are divided into groups I, II and III, according to their average SIRS. Now, looking at ATs 3, 7 and 4, their current SIRs are extremely low. Nonetheless, they are joined in group II because their previous average SIRS are high. A threshold value (CTH) is predefined that indicates the minimum SIR needed for data to get through to a destination AT. In other word, if the current SIR of an AT is lower than the C_TH, no data is expected to reach the AT. Suppose that the C_TH is 3 dB, none of ATs 3, 7 and 4 qualifies to receive data. It is a waste of resources to try to send data to any of these ATs. The algorithm according to the present invention will transmit no data to any of these ATs until their current SIRs recover to go above the C_TH. The C_TH is used in the processes in Step <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. As discussed above, the second slot in each slot sequence is allocated to group II. When i&equals;2, the scheduler selects the AT with the highest SIR from group II (Step <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>). The AT with the highest SIR in group II is AT 7 or 4. The scheduler then compares the SIR of the AT against the C_TH, which is 3 dB. But neither AT 7 nor AT 4 has an SIR higher than the C_TH. If the SIR of the selected AT does not exceed the C_TH, the scheduler moves to Step <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and sends no data. As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>B, the second slots in the first and second sequences are made idle, and no data is transmitted in these two slots. The SIRs of ATs 3, 7 and 4 may be temporarily low. When the SIRs of any of these ATs become higher than the C_TH, the scheduler will resumes transmission of data to the ATs as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</cross-reference> (See the second slot in the third sequence, where transmission of data to group II is resumed). It should be noted that instead of making such slots idle, the scheduler may send data to ATs in other groups, using the slots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the algorithm according to the present invention is designed to serve AT groups and does not serve individual ATs directly. By allocating more slot groups to AT groups with better channel conditions (, or more specifically, AT groups with ATs having better channel conditions), the algorithm will optimize the overall data throughput. By allocating at least one slot group to AT groups with poor channel conditions, the algorithm guarantees the minimum service to ATs with poor channel conditions. However, this design concept of the algorithms may not work well if the number of the ATs in a group increases disproportionally to those in the other groups. Taking <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</cross-reference> as an example, to maximize the overall data throughput, the ATs in group I should receive more time slots than those in group II or group III. Likewise, the individual ATs in group II should receive more time slots than those in group III. Suppose that the number of ATs in group I increases. Given that the number of slots allocated to group I does not change, an increase of ATs causes deterioration of service to the individual ATs in group I. In other words, when the number of ATs in group I increases, the individual ATs in the group will receive less slots. It may result that if the number of ATs in group I increases significantly disproportionally to that of group II, the individual ATs in the group I receive less slots than those in group II although more slots are allocated to group I than group II. If this happens, the overall data throughput is expected to deteriorate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> One way to prevent such a situation from happening is to set a maximum AT number for each group and restrict the number of ATs in the group equal to or less than the maximum number. For instance, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, ATs 1-9 are divided into three groups I, II and III according to their average SIRs. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the maximum number of ATs allowed to be joined is predetermined and fixed to three for each of the groups. Also, in grouping the ATs, the scheduler groups ATs with higher average SIRs ({overscore (SIR)}<highlight><subscript>(t)</subscript></highlight>) first. Now, looking at AT 2 in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, its average SIR is 8 dB and should be placed into group II. But since ATs with higher average SIRs are grouped first, group II is already filled with ATs 3, 7 and 4. Accordingly, AT 2, whose average SIR exceeds the threshold value of 7 dB, is grouped into group III. This is unfair to AT 2 but necessary to increase the overall data throughput. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The number of the ATs in a group can be restricted indirectly by changing the threshold values used for grouping ATs. Suppose that the maximum number of the ATs allowed to be joined in each group is predetermined, but the scheduler groups ATs 1-9 without regard to the predetermined number. After grouping the ATs, the scheduler checks the number of the ATs in each group and determines if the number of the ATs in each group is larger than the predetermined number, allowing a certain percentage of margin, for instance 20% of the predetermined number. If the scheduler finds a group that has more ATs, allowing a certain percentage of margin, than allowed to be in the group, the scheduler changes the threshold values that define the group so as to reduce the number of ATs to be admitted into the group in the next grouping process. A margin is necessary because most small frustrations of the number of the ATs over the predetermined number are considered temporary. Thus, the scheduler acts to change threshold values only when the number of the ATs jumps up over the predetermined number by more than, for instance, 20% thereof. The scheduler will disregards increases of the ATs within the margin even if the number of the ATs exceeds the predetermined number. In situations where the number of the ATs increases over the maximum number by more than 20% thereof, it will probably be the most practical solution to raise the threshold level defining the bottom line of the group. By raising the bottom threshold level, the number of ATs to be admitted into the group is expected to decrease. An amount of threshold value increased at a time is set to be, for instance, 1 dB. Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>A, the bottom threshold level is increased as the number of ATs increases. The same arrangements may be made for decrease in the number of ATs. That is, if the number of the ATs decreases below the predetermined number by more than, for instance, 20% thereof, the bottom threshold level is lowered by, for instance, 1 dB. By lowering the bottom threshold level, the number of ATs to be admitted into the group is expected to increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The whole purpose of restricting the numbers of ATs admitted in groups is to maintain the quality of service to individual ATs at predetermined levels. This is necessary to maximize the overall data throughput. The same purpose may be achieved by changing the number of slots allocated to a group as the number of the ATs in the group changes. That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>B, when the number of ATs in a group increases, the quality of service to the individual ATs may be maintained by increasing the number of slots allocated to the group. Similarly, when the number of ATs in a group decreases, the quality of service to the individual ATs may be maintained at a predetermined level by decreasing the number of slots allocated to the group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The concept of changing a threshold level may be used to maintain the average channel condition in a group. The average channel condition in a group that may be represented by the average of the FERs (frame error rate) of the ATs in the group may need to be maintained at a constant level. If the average FER increases, it needs to be lowered. It is probable that ATs located near the lower end of a group cause an increase in average FER of the group. Therefore, as the average FER in a group increase, the lower threshold level defining the bottom of the group is raised as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11C</cross-reference>. By the raising the lower threshold level, ATs with low FER will be placed the group below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiments, signal to interference ratio (SIR) is used as channel condition information based on which ATs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are grouped and selected in the AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. But other channel condition information may be used for the same purpose, such as signal to noise and interference ratio (SNIR) and signal energy to noise ratio (E/N). Error rates may be used for the same purpose, such as frame error rate (FER) and bit error rate (BER). Also, in the above embodiments, ATs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> measure their SIRs and send them to the AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which converts the measured SIRs into corresponding data rates, using above Table 2. The conversion of SIRs into data rates may be performed in individual ATs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, which send the raw data rates or DRCs to the AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. These data rates or DRCs may be used in the AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> for grouping and selecting the ATs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. An embodiment using DRCs is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the scheduler calculates an average DRC ({overscore (DRC)}<highlight><subscript>(t)</subscript></highlight>) for each of the ATs, using equation (2) noted below. </paragraph>

An AT with an average DRC of 1 or lower is placed in group III. In selecting an AT in a group, however, the scheduler calculates a ratio of the current DRC and the average DRC, i.e.,

<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The scheduler then selects from the group one AT which has the highest weighted ratio. Alternatively, the ATs in each group are further divided into two subgroups. One subgroup consists of ATs with high QoS factors. The other subgroup consists of ATs with low QoS factors. In selecting an AT from a group, the scheduler selects the AT from a subgroup with high QoS factors first. If QoS factors are used, ATs may not have to be grouped. For each of ATs 1-9 being not grouped, the scheduler calculates the weighted ratio. In assigning slots to ATs 1-9, the scheduler selects the AT with the highest weighted ratio. If among ATs 1-9, some contact to have guaranteed QoS, but the others do not, the scheduler may divide ATs 1-9 into a group with no guaranteed QoS and a group with guaranteed QoS. In each slot sequence, the scheduler assigns more slots to the group with guaranteed QoS so that the ATs with guaranteed QoS will be served favorably over the ATs with no guaranteed QoS. The group with guaranteed QoS may also be divided into a subgroup with high QoS and a subgroup with low QoS. In such an arrangement, the scheduler serves the subgroup with high QoS first and the subgroup with low QoS later. The ATs with no guaranteed QoS are served in the manner, for instance, as shown in above <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiments, the scheduler performs the grouping and selection of ATs based on current values and/or past average values of channel condition information (SIRs) or data rates (DRCs). The scheduler may calculate future values and perform the grouping and selection of ATs based on the calculated future values. There are many statistical methods available to predict future values. One of the simplest ways to predict a future value is a linear prediction method which uses the following equation (3): </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>A future value (<highlight><italic>t&plus;</italic></highlight>1)&equals;2&times;(current value (<highlight><italic>t</italic></highlight>))&minus;(previous value(<highlight><italic>t&minus;</italic></highlight>1))&emsp;&emsp;(2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiments, the channel condition is measured at an AT <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, using a pilot symbol received from the AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. If the time division duplexing (TDD) scheme is adopted, however, the AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may measure the channel condition. Under the TDD scheme, sender and receiver, i.e., the AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the ATs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, time-share the same channel. Under this scheme, the AP <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can estimate the downlink conditions by measuring the uplink conditions, using data from the ATs 150. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The algorithms according to the present invention are designed to maximize the overall data throughput while guaranteeing minimum service to ATs with poor channel condition. Even using these algorithms, if a large number of ATs request data simultaneously, the minimum service may not be able to be guaranteed to ATs with poor channel condition. Therefore, to guarantee the minimum service to ATs with poor channel condition, an arrangement may be necessary that restricts the number of ATs allowed to receive service simultaneously. In such an arrangement, once the number of ATs requesting data reaches a certain threshold level, further requests from other ATs will be rejected. Alternatively, another arrangement is possible that once the number of ATs requesting data reaches the threshold level, further requests from other ATs will be put on hold, and those ATs whose request are on hold are placed on a waiting list. Each time service is completed to one AT, and the one AT is removed from an active list, one AT on the waiting list is moved to the active list to receive service. Moreover, if an AT is on the waiting list for a certain time, the AT will be moved to the active list, even when no AT is removed from the active list. Low service may be better than nothing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The concept of the present invention may be applied to a situation where the AP <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> multicasts data to a plurality of ATs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. When multicasting data to a plurality of ATs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, an arrangement may be made in which the scheduler multicasts data at a predetermined multicast data rate when all or most of the ATs are requesting data rates that are more than the predetermined data rate. After multicasting data at the predetermined multicast data rate to ATs, if any of the ATs fail to receive the data and return a NACK, the scheduler lowers the multicast data rate and multicasts data at the lowered data rate to the ATs that have returned the NACK. The scheduler holds multicasting of data until all or most of the ATs request more than the predetermined multicast data rate. However, the scheduler cannot hold the multicasting for long. Accordingly, if it holds multicasting of data for a certain time period, the scheduler begins the multicasting at the lowest data rate requested among the ATs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Once the scheduling is done, the scheduler may send the ATs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> the scheduling result such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference>. By receiving the scheduling result, the ATs will know what slots are assigned to them. The ATs <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may put themselves in a sleep mode during the slots not assigned to them but wake up to get themselves ready to receive data at the slots assigned to them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> What have been described are preferred embodiments of the present invention. The foregoing description is intended to be exemplary and not limiting in nature. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications and additions may be made while retaining the novel and advantageous characteristics of the invention and without departing from its spirit.
