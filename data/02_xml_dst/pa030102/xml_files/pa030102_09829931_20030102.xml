<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to polynucleotides corresponding to the plsC gene and which encode 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, methods of producing L-amino acids, and methods of screening for polynucleotides which encode proteins having 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of the Background </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Amino acids, particularly L-lysine and L-glutamate, are used in human medicine, in the pharmaceutical industry, in the food industry, and are used in particular in animal nutrition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is known that amino acids are produced by the fermentation of strains of coryneform bacteria, particularly <highlight><italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic></highlight>. Due to the considerable importance of these amino acids, attempts are continuously being made to improve the production process. Process improvements can involve fermentation technology measures, such as stirring and supplying with oxygen for example, or can relate to the composition of the culture media, such as the sugar concentration during fermentation for example, or to work-up to give the desired form of product by ion exchange chromatography for example, or to the intrinsic production properties of the microorganism itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Methods of mutagenesis, selection and mutant selection are employed in order to improve the production properties of these microorganisms. In this manner, strains are obtained which are resistant to antimetabolites, such as the lysine analogon S-(2-aminoethyl)-cysteine for example, or which are auxotrophic for metabolites of regulatory importance, and which produce L-amino acids such as L-lysine or L-glutamate for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Moreover, for some years methods of recombinant DNA technology have been used to improve strains of Corynebacterium which produce amino acids. This has been achieved by amplifying individual amino acid biosynthesis genes and investigating the effect on amino acid production. Review articles on this topic, amongst other sources, are those by Kinoshita (&ldquo;Glutamic Acid Bacteria&rdquo;, in: Biology of Industrial Microorganisms, Demain and Solomon (Eds.), Benjamin Cummings, London, UK, 1985, 115-142), Hilliger (BioTec 2, 40-44 (1991)), Eggeling (Amino Acids 6:261-272 (1994)), Jetten and Sinskey (Critical Reviews in Biotechnology 15, 73-103 (1995)) and Sahm et al. (Annals of the New York Academy of Science 782, 25-39 (1996)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> However, there remains a critical need for improved methods of producing L-amino acids and thus for the provision of strains of bacteria producing higher amounts of L-amino acids. On a commercial or industrial scale even small improvements in the yield of L-amino acids, or the efficiency of their production, are economically significant. Prior to the present invention, it was not recognized that enhancement or over-expression of the plsC gene, encoding 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, would improve L-amino acid yields. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One object of the present invention, is providing a new process adjuvant for improving the fermentative production of L-amino acids, particularly L-lysine and L-glutamate. Such process adjuvants include enhanced bacteria, preferably enhanced coryneform bacteria which express high amounts of 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase which is encoded by the plsC gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Thus, another object of the present invention is providing such an enhanced bacterium, which expresses an enhanced amount of 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase or gene products of the plsC gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is providing a bacterium, preferably a coryneform bacterium, which expresses a polypeptide that has an enhanced 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another object of the invention is to provide a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide which has 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase sequence. One embodiment of such a sequence is the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is a method of making 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase or an isolated polypeptide having a 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity, as well as use of such isolated polypeptides in the production of amino acids. One embodiment of such a polypeptide is the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Other objects of the invention include methods of detecting nucleic acid sequences homologous to SEQ ID NO: 1, particularly nucleic acid sequences encoding polypeptides that have 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity, and methods of making nucleic acids encoding such polypeptides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The above objects highlight certain aspects of the invention. Additional objects, aspects and embodiments of the invention are found in the following detailed description of the invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art of molecular biology. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, suitable methods and materials are described herein. All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict, the present specification, including definitions, will control. In addition, the materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and are not intended to be limiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Reference is made to standard textbooks of molecular biology that contain definitions and methods and means for carrying out basic techniques, encompassed by the present invention. See, for example, Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York (1982) and Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York (1989) and the various references cited therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Amino acids, particularly L-lysine and L-glutamate, are used in human medicine, in veterinary medicine, in the pharmaceutical industry and particularly in the food industry. There is therefore a general interest in the provision of new, improved processes for producing amino acids, particularly L-glutamate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When L-lysine or lysine or L-glutamate or glutamate are mentioned below, this means not only the bases but also the salts thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a coryneform bacterium, in which the plsC gene thereof, which encodes 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, is enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In this connection, the term &ldquo;enhancement&rdquo; means increasing the intracellular activity of one or more enzymes in a microorganism which are encoded by the corresponding DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Enhancement can be achieved with the aid of various manipulations of the bacterial cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve enhancement, particularly over-expression, the number of copies of the corresponding gene can be increased, a strong promoter can be used, or the promoter- and regulation region or the ribosome binding site which is situated upstream of the structural gene can be mutated. Expression cassettes which are incorporated upstream of the structural gene act in the same manner. In addition, it is possible to increase expression in the course of the fermentative production of L-lysine- or L-glutamate by employing inducible promoters. A gene can also be used which encodes a corresponding enzyme with a high activity. Expression can also be improved by measures for extending the life of the m-RNA. Furthermore, enzyme activity as a whole is increased by preventing the degradation of the enzyme. Moreover, these measures can optionally be combined in any desired manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Additionally, a strong promoter can be used, or the promoter- and regulation region or the ribosome binding site which is situated upstream of the structural gene can be engineered or mutated. Expression cassettes which are incorporated upstream of the structural gene act in the same manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Similarly, it is possible to increase gene expression in the course of the fermentative production of an amino acid, such as L-lysine- or L-glutamate by employing inducible promoters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A gene can also be used which encodes a corresponding or variant enzyme with a high activity. Preferably the corresponding enzyme has a greater activity than the native form of the enzyme, more preferably at least in the range of 5, 10, 25% or 50% more activity, most preferably more than twice the activity of the native enzyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Expression can also be improved by measures for extending the life of the m-RNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, enzyme activity as a whole can be increased by preventing the degradation of the expressed enzyme. Moreover, these measures can optionally be combined in any desired manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The microorganisms to which the present invention relates can produce L-amino acids, particularly L-lysine and L-glutamate, from glucose, saccharose, lactose, fructose, maltose, molasses, starch or cellulose, or from glycerol and ethanol. They can be representatives of coryneform bacteria, particularly of the genus Corynebacterium. A bacterium of the genus Corynebacterium which should be mentioned in particular is the <highlight><italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum </italic></highlight>species, which is known to those skilled in the art for its capacity of producing L-amino acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Examples of suitable strains of the genus Corynebacterium, particularly of the <highlight><italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum </italic></highlight>species, are the known wild-type strains </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a bacterial strain enhanced for expression of a plsC-like gene that encodes a polypeptide with 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity, will improve amino acid yields at least 1%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the context of the present Application, a polynucleotide sequence is &ldquo;homologous&rdquo; with the sequence according to the invention if at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, most preferably at least 90% of its base composition and base sequence corresponds to the sequence according to the invention. According to the invention, a &ldquo;homologous protein&rdquo; is to be understood to comprise proteins which contain an amino acid sequence at least 70% of which, preferably at least 80% of which, most preferably at least 90% of which, corresponds to the amino acid sequence which is encoded by the plsC gene (SEQ ID No. 1), wherein &ldquo;corresponds&rdquo; is to be understood to mean that the corresponding amino acids are either identical or are mutually homologous amino acids. The expression &ldquo;homologous amino acids&rdquo; denotes those which have corresponding properties, particularly with regard to their charge, hydrophobic character, steric properties, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Homology, sequence similarity or sequence identity of nucleotide or amino acid sequences may be determined conventionally by using known software or computer programs such as the BestFit or Gap pairwise comparison programs (GCG Wisconsin Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis. 53711). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> BestFit uses the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, Advances in Applied Mathematics 2: 482-489 (1981), to find the best segment of identity or similarity between two sequences. Gap performs global alignments: all of one sequence with all of another similar sequence using the method of Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443-453 (1970). When using a sequence alignment program such as BestFit, to determine the degree of sequence homology, similarity or identity, the default setting may be used, or an appropriate scoring matrix may be selected to optimize identity, similarity or homology scores. Similarly, when using a program such as BestFit to determine sequence identity, similarity or homology between two different amino acid sequences, the default settings may be used, or an appropriate scoring matrix, such as blosum45blosum80, may be selected to optimize identity, similarity or homology scores. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to a polynucleotide as described above, which is preferably a replicable DNA containing: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> (i) the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID No. 1, or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> (ii) at least one sequence which corresponds to sequence (i) in the context of the degeneration of the genetic code, or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> (iii) at least one sequence which hybridizes with the sequence complementary to sequence(i) or (ii), and optionally </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> (iv) functionally neutral mutations in (i) which result in the same or a homologous amino acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The present invention further relates to </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> a replicable polynucleotide which comprises or consists of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID No. 2, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> a polynucleotide sequence which encodes a polypeptide which comprises or consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID No. 2, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> a vector containing the DNA sequence of <highlight><italic>C. glutamicum </italic></highlight>which encodes the plsC gene, contained in the vector (plasmid) pJC1plsC deposited as a <highlight><italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum </italic></highlight>with the number DSM 13492, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> and coryneform bacteria which serve as a host cell and which contain the vector or in which the plsC gene is enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The present invention also relates to polynucleotides which contain the complete gene with the polynucleotide sequence corresponding to SEQ ID No. 1 or fragments thereof, and which can be obtained by screening by means of the hybridization of a corresponding gene bank with a probe which contains the sequence of said polynucleotide corresponding to SEQ ID No. 1 or a fragment thereof, and isolation of said DNA sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Polynucleotide sequences according to the invention are suitable as hybridization probes for RNA, cDNA and DNA, in order to isolate the complete length of cDNA which encodes 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase and in order to isolate those cDNAs or genes which exhibit a high degree of similarity to the sequence of the 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Polynucleotide sequences according to the invention are also suitable as primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the production of DNA which encodes 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Oligonucleotides such as these, which serve as probes or primers, can contain more than 30, preferably up to 30, more preferably up to 20, most preferably at least 15 successive nucleotides. Oligonucleotides with a length of at least 40 or 50 nucleotides are also suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;isolated&rdquo; means separated from its natural environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;polynucleotide&rdquo; refers in general to polyribonucleotides and polydeoxyribonucleotides, and can denote an unmodified RNA or DNA or a modified RNA or DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;polypeptides&rdquo; is to be understood to mean peptides or proteins which contain two or more amino acids which are bound via peptide bonds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The polypeptides according to invention include polypeptides corresponding to SEQ ID No. 2, particularly those with the biological activity of 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, and also includes those, at least 70% of which, preferably at least 80% of which, are homologous with the polypeptide corresponding to SEQ ID No. 2, and most preferably those which exhibit a homology of least 90% to 95% with the polypeptide corresponding to SEQ ID No. 2 and which have the cited activity. The invention also relates to a process for the fermentative production of L-amino acids, particularly L-lysine and L-glutamate, using coryneform bacteria which in particular already produce an amino acid and in which the nucleotide sequences which encode the plsC gene are enhanced, and in particular are over-expressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the plsC gene of <highlight><italic>C. glutamicum </italic></highlight>which encodes 1-acyl-SN-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.51) is demonstrated for the first time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In order to isolate the plsC gene or other genes of <highlight><italic>C. glutamicum</italic></highlight>, a gene bank of this microorganism is first of all constructed in <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>. The construction of gene banks is described in generally known textbooks and handbooks. Examples thereof include the textbook by Winnacker: Gene und Klone, Eine Einf&uuml;hrung in die Gentechnologie (Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany, 1990) or the Handbook by Sambrook et al.: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). One very well known gene bank is that of the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>K-12 strain W3110, which was constructed by Kohara et al. (Cell 50, 495-508 (1987)) in &lgr;-vectors. Bathe et al. (Molecular and General Genetics, 252:255-265, 1996) described a gene bank of <highlight><italic>C. glutamicum </italic></highlight>ATCC13032, which with the aid of the cosmid vector SuperCos I (Wahl et al., 1987, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 84:2160-2164) was constructed in the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>K-12 strain NM554 (Raleigh et al., 1988, Nucleic Acids Research 16:1563-1575. Bormann et al. (Molecular Microbiology 6(3), 317-326 (1992)) in turn describe a gene bank of <highlight><italic>C. glutamicum </italic></highlight>ATCC13032 using the cosmid pHC79 (Hohn and Collins, Gene 11, 291-298 (1980)). Plasmids such as pBR322 (Bolivar, Life Sciences, 25, 807-818 (1979)) or pUC9 (Vieira et al., 1982, Gene, 19:259-268) can also be used for the production of a gene bank of <highlight><italic>C. glutamicum </italic></highlight>in <highlight><italic>E. coli. </italic></highlight>Those <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>-strains which are restriction- and recombination-deficient are particularly suitable as hosts. One example thereof is the strain DH5&agr;mcr, which was described by Grant et al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 87 (1990) 4645-4649). Long DNA fragments which are cloned with the aid of cosmids can subsequently again be subcloned in common vectors which are suitable for sequencing and can then be sequenced, as described by Sanger et al. (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 74:5463-5467, 1977). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In this manner, a new DNA sequence of <highlight><italic>C. glutamicum </italic></highlight>has been obtained which encodes the plsC gene and which as SEQ ID No. 1 forms part of the present invention. Moreover, the amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein has been derived from the present DNA sequence using the methods described above. The resulting amino acid sequence of the plsC gene product is illustrated in SEQ ID No. 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The invention also relates to coding DNA sequences which result from SEQ ID No. 1 by degeneration of the genetic code. In the same manner, the invention further relates to DNA sequences which hybridize with SEQ ID No. 1 or with parts of SEQ ID No. 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Moreover, one skilled in the art is also aware of conservative amino acid replacements such as the replacement of glycine by alanine or of aspartic acid by glutamic acid in proteins as &ldquo;sense mutations&rdquo; which do not result in any fundamental change in the activity of the protein, i.e. which are functionally neutral. It is also known that changes at the N- and/or C-terminus of a protein do not substantially impair the function thereof, and may even stabilise said function. Amongst other sources, one skilled in the art will find information on this topic in the articles by Ben-Bassat et al. (Journal of Bacteriology 169:751-757 (1987)), by O&apos;Regan et al. (Gene 77:237-251 (1989)), by Sahin-Toth et al. (Protein Sciences 3:240-247 (1994)), by Hochuli et al. (Bio/Technology 6:1321-1325 (1988)) and in known textbooks on genetics and molecular biology. The present invention also relates to amino acid sequences which result in a corresponding manner from SEQ ID No. 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In the same manner, the present invention also relates to DNA sequences which hybridize with SEQ ID No. 1 or with parts of SEQ ID No. 1. Finally, the present invention relates to DNA sequences which are produced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotide primers which result from SEQ ID No. 1. Oligonucleotides of this type typically have a length of at least nucleotides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Amongst other sources, one skilled in the art will find instructions for the identification of DNA sequences by means of hybridization in the Handbook &ldquo;The DIG System User&apos;s Guide for Filter Hybridization&rdquo; published by Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany, 1993) and in the article by Liebl et al. (International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology (1991) 41: 255-260). Amongst other sources, one skilled in the art will find instructions for the amplification of DNA sequences with the aid of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the Handbooks by Gait: Oligonucleotides synthesis: a practical approach (IRL Press, Oxford, UK, 1984) and by Newton and Graham: PCR (Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany, 1994). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The work which has been carried out on the present invention has enabled it to be ascertained that, after enhancement of their plsC genes has been effected, coryneform bacteria produce amino acids, particularly L-lysine and L-glutamate, in an improved manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The genes or gene constructs concerned can either be present with different numbers of copies in plasmids, or can be integrated and amplified in the chromosome. Alternatively, over-expression of the gene concerned can be effected by changing the composition of the medium and by changing the way in which cultivation is effected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Amongst other sources, one skilled in the art will find instructions on this topic in the articles by Martin et al. (Bio/Technology 5, 137-146 (1987)), by Guerrero et al. (Gene 138, 35-41 (1994)), by Tsuchiya and Morinaga (Bio/Technology 6, 428-430 (1988)), by Eikmanns et al. (Gene 102, 93-98 (1991)), in European Patent Specification EPS 0 472 869, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,601,893, in the articles by Schwarzer and Puhler (Bio/Technology 9, 84-87 (1991), by Reinscheid et al. (Applied and Environmental Microbiology 60, 126-132 (1994)), by LaBarre et al. (Journal of Bacteriology 175, 1001-1007 (1993)), in Patent Application WO 96/15246, in the article by Malumbres et al. (Gene 134, 15-24 (1993)), in Japanese laid-open Patent Specification JP-A-10-229891, in the articles by Jensen and Hammer (Biotechnology and Bioengineering 58, 191-195 (1998)), by Makrides (Microbiological Reviews 60:512-538 (1996)) and in known textbooks on genetics and molecular biology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> For example, the plsC gene according to the invention has been over-expressed with the aid of plasmids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Suitable plasmids are those which are replicated and expressed in coryneform bacteria. Numerous known plasmid vectors such as pZ1 (Menkel et al., Applied and Environmental Microbiology (1989) 64: 549-554), pEKEx1 (Eikmanns et al., Gene 102:93-98 (1991)) or pHS2-1 (Sonnen et al., Gene 107:69-74 (1991)) are based on the cryptic plasmids pHM1519, pBL1 or pGA1. Other plasmid vectors, such as those which are based on pCG4 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,489,160), or pNG2 (Serwold-Davis et al., FEMS Microbiology Letters 66, 119-124 (1990)), or pAG1 (U.S. Pat. No. 5,158,891), can be used in the same manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> One example of a plasmid with the aid of which the plsC gene can be over-expressed is pJC1plsC (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), which is based on the <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>C. glutamicum </italic></highlight>shuttle vector pJC1 (Cremer et al., 1990, Molecular and General Genetics 220: 478-480) and which contains the DNA sequence of <highlight><italic>C. glutamicum </italic></highlight>which encodes the plsC gene. This is contained in the strain DSM5715/pJC1plsC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Also suitable are those plasmid vectors by means of which the process of gene amplification by integration in the chromosome can be employed, such as that described, for example, by Reinscheid et al. (Applied and Environmental Microbiology 60, 126-132 (1994)) for the duplication or amplification of the hom-thrb operon. In this method, the complete gene is cloned in a plasmid vector which can replicate in a host (typically <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>), but which cannot replicate in <highlight><italic>C. glutamicum</italic></highlight>. Examples of suitable vectors include pSUP301 (Simon et al., Bio/Technology 1, 784-791 (1983)), pK18mob or pK19mob (Sch&auml;fer et al., Gene 145, 69-73 (1994)), pGEM-T (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wiss., USA), pCR2.1-TOPO (Shuman (1994). Journal of Biological Chemistry 269:32678-84; U.S. Pat. No. 5,487,993), pCR&reg;Blunt (Invitrogen, Groningen, Holland; Bernard et al., Journal of Molecular Biology, 234: 534-541 (1993)) or pEM1 (Schrumpf et al, 1991, Journal of Bacteriology 173:4510-4516). The plasmid vector which contains the gene to be amplified is subsequently converted by conjugation or transformation into the desired strain of <highlight><italic>C. glutamicum</italic></highlight>. The conjugation method is described, for example, by Sch&auml;fer et al. (Applied and Environmental Microbiology 60, 756-759 (1994)). Transformation methods are described, for example, by Thierbach et al. (Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology 29, 356-362 (1988)), by Dunican and Shivnan (Bio/Technology 7, 1067-1070 (1989)) and by Tauch et al. (FEMS Microbiological Letters 123, 343-347 (1994)). After homologous recombination by means of a &ldquo;cross over&rdquo; occurrence, the resulting strain contains at least two copies of the gene concerned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Moreover, apart from the plsC gene, it may be advantageous for the production of amino acids, particularly L-glutamate, to intensify or over-express one or more genes which encode enzymes of the biosynthesis route employed, of glycolysis, of anaplerosis, of the citric acid cycle or of amino acid export. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Thus, for the production of L-lysine, for example, one or more genes selected from the following group can be simultaneously enhanced, and in particular can be over-expressed or amplified: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> the gap gene which encodes glyceraldehe-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Eikmanns (1992), Journal of Bacteriology 174:6076-6086), or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> the tpi gene which encodes triose phosphate isomerase (Eikmanns (1992), Journal of Bacteriology 174:6076-6086), or </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, for the production of L-glutamate, for example, one or more genes selected from the following group can be simultaneously enhanced, and in particular can be over-expressed or amplified: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> the gdh gene which encodes glutamate-dehydrogenase (DE: 19907347.3), and/or </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Moreover, for the production of L-lysine it may be advantageous if, in addition to the enhancement of the plsC gene: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> the pck gene which encodes phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase (DE 199 50 409.1, DSM 13047) and/or </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, for the production of L-glutamate it may be advantageous if, in addition to the enhancement of the plsC gene: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> the odhA gene which encodes &agr;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (WO 9534672 A1 951221*), or </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> the dtsR2 gene which encodes DtsR2 protein (WO 9902692A A1 990121*), </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> &emsp;is simultaneously attenuated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Moreover, for the production of amino acids, particularly L-lysine and L-glutamate, it may be advantageous if, in addition to the over-expression of the plsC gene, unwanted secondary reactions are suppressed (Nakayama: &ldquo;Breeding of Amino Acid Producing Micro-organisms&rdquo;, in: Overproduction of Microbial Products, Krumphanzl, Sikyta, Vanek (Eds.), Academic Press, London, UK, 1982). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> The microorganisms which are produced according to the invention can be cultivated batch-wise or continuously, e.g. by a batch process (batch cultivation) or by a fed batch process (feed process) or by a repeated fed batch process (repetitive feed process), for the purpose of producing amino acids, particularly L-glutamate. A review of known methods of cultivation is given in the textbook by Chmiel (Bioprozesstechnik 1. Einf&uuml;hrung in die Bioverfahrenstechnik (Gustav Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart, 1991)) and in the textbook by Storhas (Bioreaktoren und periphere Einrichtungen (Vieweg Verlag, Brunswick/Wiesbaden, 1994)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> The culture medium which is used must fulfil the requirements of the strain concerned in a suitable manner. Descriptions of culture media for various microorganisms are given in the Handbook &ldquo;Manual of Methods for General Bacteriology&rdquo; published by the American Society for Bacteriology (Washington D.C., USA, 1981). Suitable sources of carbon include sugar and carbohydrates such as glucose, saccharose, lactose, fructose, maltose, molasses, starch and cellulose, oils and fats such as soya oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil and cocoa fat, fatty acids such as palmitic acid, stearic acid and linoleic acid, alcohols such as glycerol and ethanol, and organic acids such as acetic acid. These substances can be used individually or in admixture. Suitable sources of nitrogen include compounds which contain organic nitrogen, such as peptone, yeast extract, meat extract, malt extract, corn steep liquor, soya bean flour and urea, and inorganic compounds such as ammonium sulphate, ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate, ammonium carbonate and ammonium nitrate. These sources of nitrogen can be used individually or in admixture. Phosphoric acid, potassium dihydrogen phosphate or dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, or the corresponding sodium-containing salts, can be used as sources of phosphorus. In addition, the culture medium must contain salts of metals such as magnesium sulphate or iron sulphate which are necessary for growth. Finally, essential growth promoting substances such as amino acids and vitamins can be used in addition to the aforementioned substances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Moreover, suitable precursors can be added to the culture medium. The aforementioned substances which are used can be added to the culture in the form of a single batch or can be supplied in a suitable manner during cultivation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Basic compounds such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonia or aqueous ammonia, or acidic compounds such as phosphoric acid or sulphuric acid are used in a suitable manner in order to control the pH of the culture. Anti-foaming agents such polyglycol esters of fatty acids can be used to control the generation of foam. In order to maintain the stability of plasmids, suitable substances with a selective action, such as antibiotics, can be added to the medium. In order to maintain aerobic conditions, oxygen or oxygen-containing gas mixtures such as air are passed into the culture. The temperature of the culture normally ranges from 20&deg; C. to 45&deg; C. and is preferably 25&deg; C. to 40&deg; C. Cultivation is continued until a maximum of glutamate has been formed. This target is normally reached within hours to 160 hours. The following microorganism has been deposited in the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ, Brunswick, Germany) in accordance with the Budapest Convention: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Chromosomal DNA from <highlight><italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum </italic></highlight>ATCC13032 was isolated as described by Tauch et al. (1995, Plasmid 33:168-179) and was partially cleaved with the restriction enzyme Sau3AI (Amersham Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany, product description Sau3AI, Code no. 27-0913-02). The DNA fragments were dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany, product description SAP, Code no. 1758250). The DNA of the cosmid vector SuperCos1 (Wahl et al. (1987) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 84:2160-2164), purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, USA, product description SuperCos1 cosmid vector Kit, Code no. 251301) was cleaved with the restriction enzyme XbaI (Amersham Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany, product description XbaI, Code no. 27-0948-02) and was likewise dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The cosmid DNA was subsequently cleaved with the restriction enzyme BamHI (Amersham Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany, product description BamHI, Code no. 27-0868-04). The cosmid DNA which was treated in this manner was mixed with the treated ATCC13032-DNA and the batch was treated with T4 DNA ligase (Amersham Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany, product description T4-DNA-Ligase, Code no. 27-0870-04). The ligation mix was subsequently packed in phages with the aid of Gigapack II XL Packing Extract (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA, product description Gigapack II XL Packing Extract, Code no. 200217). In order to infect the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain NM554 (Raleigh et al. 1988, Nucleic Acid Research 16:1563-1575), the cells were taken up in mM MgSO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and were mixed with an aliquot of the phage suspension. Infection and titration of the cosmid bank were effected as described by Sambrook et al. (1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor), with the cells being plated out on to LB agar (Lennox, 1955, Virology, 1:190) with 100 mg/l ampicillin. After incubation overnight at 37&deg; C., recombinant individual clones were selected. </paragraph>

The DNA of the sequencing vector, pZero-1, purchased from Invitrogen (Groningen, Holland, product description Zero Background Cloning Kit, Product No. K2500-01) was cleaved with the restriction enzyme BamHI (Amersham Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany, product description BamHI, Product No. 27-0868-04). Ligation of the cosmid fragments in the sequencing vector pZero-1 was effected as described by Sambrook et al. (1989, Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor), the DNA mixture being incubated overnight with T4 ligase (Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). This ligation mix was subsequently transferred into <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain DH5aMCR (Grant, 1990, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences U.S.A., 87:4645-4649) by means of electroporation (Tauch et al. 1994, FEMS Microbiol Letters, 123:343-7) and the electroporation batch was plated out on LB agar (Lennox, 1955, Virology, 1:190) with mg/l zeocin. The plasmid was prepared from the recombinant clone using a Biorobot 9600 (Product No. 900200, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Sequencing was effected by the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al. (1977, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences U.S.A., 74:5463-5467) with modifications according to Zimmermann et al. (1990, Nucleic Acids Research, 18:1067). The &ldquo;RR d-Rhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit&rdquo; of PE Applied Biosystems (Product No. 403044, Weiterstadt, Germany) was used for this purpose. Separation by gel electrophoresis and analysis of the sequencing reaction were effected in a &ldquo;rotiphoresis NF acrylamide/bisacrylamide&rdquo; gel (29:1) (Product No. A124.1, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), using the &ldquo;ABI Prism 377&rdquo; sequencing device of PE Applied Biosystems (Weiterstadt, Germany). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The raw sequence data which were obtained were subsequently processed using the Staden software package (1986, Nucleic Acids Research, 14:217-231) Version 97-0. The individual sequences of the pZero 1 derivatives were assembled to form a coherent contig. Computer-aided analysis was performed using the XNIP program (Staden, 1986, Nucleic Acids Research, 14:217-231). Further analyses were performed using &ldquo;BLAST search programs&rdquo; (Altschul et al., 1997, Nucleic Acids Research, 25:3389-3402), compared with the non-redundant databank of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, Bethesda, Md., USA). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The nucleotide sequence obtained is illustrated in SEQ ID No. 1. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence showed the presence of an open reading frame comprising 735 base pairs, which was designated as the plsC gene. The plsC gene encodes a protein comprising 245 amino acids (SEQ ID No.2). </paragraph>
