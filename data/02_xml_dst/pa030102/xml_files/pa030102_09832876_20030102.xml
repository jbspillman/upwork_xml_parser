<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an oxidizing composition intended for treating keratin fibres, comprising at least one enzyme of 2-electron oxidoreductase type in the presence of at least one donor for the said enzyme and at least one nonionic guar gum, as well as to its uses for dyeing, for permanently reshaping or for bleaching keratin fibres, in particular human hair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is known to dye keratin fibres, and in particular human hair, with dye compositions containing oxidation dye precursors, in particular para-phenylenediamines, ortho- or para-aminophenols and heterocyclic bases which are generally referred to as oxidation bases. Oxidation dye precursors, or oxidation bases, are colourless or weakly coloured compounds which, when combined with oxidizing products, can give rise to coloured compounds and dyes by a process of oxidative condensation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is also known that the shades obtained with these oxidation bases can be varied by combining them with couplers or colour modifiers, the latter being chosen in particular from aromatic meta-diamines, meta-aminophenols, meta-diphenols and certain heterocyclic compounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The variety of compounds used as regards the oxidation bases and the couplers allows a wide range of colours to be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The so-called &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; coloration obtained by means of these oxidation dyes must moreover satisfy a certain number of requirements. Thus it must have no toxicological drawbacks, it must be able to give shades of the desired intensity and it must be able to withstand external agents (light, bad weather, washing, permanent-waving, perspiration, rubbing). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The dyes must also be able to cover white hair and, lastly, they must be as unselective as possible, i.e. they must give the smallest possible colour differences along the same length of keratin fibre, which may in fact be differently sensitized (i.e. damaged) between its tip and its root. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The oxidation dyeing of keratin fibres is generally carried out in alkaline medium, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. However, the use of alkaline media in the presence of hydrogen peroxide has the drawback of causing appreciable degradation of the fibres, as well as considerable bleaching of the keratin fibres, which is not always desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The oxidation dyeing of keratin fibres can also be carried out using oxidizing systems other than hydrogen peroxide, such as enzymatic systems. Thus, it has already been proposed to dye keratin fibres, in particular in patent application EP-A-0,310,675, with compositions comprising an oxidation dye precursor in combination with enzymes such as pyranose oxidase, glucose oxidase or uricase, in the presence of a donor for the said enzymes. Although being used under conditions which do not result in degradation of the keratin fibres which is comparable to that caused by the dyes used in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, these dye formulations nevertheless lead to colorations which are still insufficient, both as regards the homogeneity of the colour distributed along the fibre (&ldquo;unison&rdquo;) and as regards the chromaticity (luminosity), the dyeing power and the resistance to the various aggressive factors to which the hair may be subjected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is known that the most common technique for obtaining a permanent reshaping of the hair consists, in a first stage, in opening the keratin -S-S-disulphide (cysteine) bonds using a composition containing a suitable reducing agent (reduction step) followed, after having rinsed the head of hair thus treated, by reconstituting, in a second stage, the said disulphide bonds by applying to the hair, which has been placed under tension beforehand (rollers and the like), an oxidizing composition (oxidation step, also known as the fixing step) so as finally to give to the hair the desired shape. This technique thus makes it equally possible either to make the hair wavy or to straighten it or to remove its curliness. The new shape given to the hair by a chemical treatment such as above is remarkably long-lasting and in particular resists the action of washing with water or shampoos, as opposed to simple standard techniques for temporary reshaping, such as hairsetting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The reducing compositions which may be used in order to carry out the first step of a permanent-waving operation generally contain, as reducing agents, sulphites, bisulphites, alkylphosphines or, preferably, thiols. Among the thiols, those commonly used are cysteine and the various derivatives thereof, cysteamine and the derivatives thereof, thiolactic acid or thioglycolic acid, the salts thereof and the esters thereof, in particular glyceryl thioglycolate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As regards the oxidizing compositions needed to carry out the fixing step, use is usually made in practice of compositions based on aqueous hydrogen peroxide, sodium bromate or persalts such as sodium perborate, which have the drawback of being liable to damage the hair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The problem of the technique of the permanent-waving operations known to date is that their application to the hair induces long-term adverse changes in the quality of the hair. The essential causes of these adverse changes in the quality of the hair are a reduction in its cosmetic properties, such as its sheen and its feel, and degradation of its mechanical properties, more particularly degradation of its mechanical strength due to swelling of the keratin fibres during the rinsing between the reduction step and the oxidation step, which can also be reflected by an increase in its porosity. The hair is weakened and can become brittle during subsequent treatments such as blow-drying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The same problem of adverse changes in keratin fibres is encountered during processes for bleaching the hair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is known that the permanent reshaping or bleaching of keratin fibres can also be carried out under milder conditions using oxidizing systems other than hydrogen peroxide, such as enzymatic systems. Thus, processes for the permanent reshaping or bleaching of keratin fibres have already been proposed, in particular in patent application EP-A-0,310,675, with compositions comprising an enzyme such as pyranose oxidase, glucose oxidase or uricase, in the presence of a donor for the said enzyme. Although being used under conditions which do not result in degradation of the keratin fibres which is comparable to that caused by conventional permanent-waving or bleaching processes, these oxidizing formulations nevertheless lead to results which are still insufficient, as regards the curl hold over time, as regards the compatibility of permanent-waved or bleached hair with subsequent treatments, as regards the reduction of the mechanical properties of the permanent-waved hair, in particular the reduction of the porosity of the hair, and as regards the reduction of the cosmetic properties such as the feel, or alternatively as regards the uniformity of the bleaching along the keratin fibres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The aim of the present invention is to solve the problems mentioned above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The Applicant has discovered, surprisingly, novel compositions containing, as oxidizing system, at least one enzyme of 2-electron oxidoreductase type in the presence of at least one donor for the said enzyme and at least one nonionic guar gum, which can constitute, in the presence of oxidation dye precursors (oxidation bases) and optionally couplers, ready-to-use dye formulations which lead to more homogeneous, more intense and more chromatic colorations without giving rise to any significant degradation, these colorations being relatively unselective and showing good resistance to the various aggressive factors to which the hair may be subjected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The Applicant has also discovered, unexpectedly, that the use, in a process for the permanent reshaping of keratin fibres, of an oxidizing composition containing, as oxidizing system, at least one enzyme of 2-electron oxidoreductase type in the presence of at least one donor for the said enzyme and at least one nonionic guar gum, makes it possible to solve the technical problems mentioned above. In particular, this type of oxidizing composition improves the curl hold obtained over time, substantially reduces the porosity of permanent-waved hair and improves the compatibility of permanent-waved hair with respect to subsequent treatments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The Applicant has also discovered, surprisingly, that the use, in a process for bleaching keratin fibres, of an oxidizing composition containing, as oxidizing system, at least one enzyme of 2-electron oxidoreductase typein the presence of at least one donor for the said enzyme and at least one nonionic guar gum makes it possible to solve the technical problems mentioned above, in particular to improve the compatibility of bleached hair with respect to subsequent treatments. This type of oxidizing composition gives a more uniform bleaching effect on the hair and improves the cosmetic properties, such as the feel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> These discoveries form the basis of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The subject of the present invention is thus, firstly, a cosmetic and/or dermatological composition intended for treating keratin fibres, in particular human keratin fibres and more particularly human hair, comprising, in a support which is suitable for keratin fibres: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> (a) at least one enzyme of 2-electron oxidoreductase type in the presence of at least one donor for the said enzyme, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> (b) at least one nonionic guar gum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The 2-electron oxidoreductase(s) used in the oxidizing compositions in accordance with the invention can be chosen in particular from pyranose oxidases, glucose oxidases, glycerol oxidases, lactate oxidases, pyruvate oxidases and uricases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the 2-electron oxidoreductase is preferably chosen from uricases of animal, microbiological or biotechnological origin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> By way of example, mention may be made of uricase extracted from boar liver, uricase from <highlight><italic>Arthrobacter globiformis, </italic></highlight>as well as uricase from <highlight><italic>Aspergillus flavus. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The 2-electron oxidoreductase(s) can be used in pure crystalline form or in a form diluted in a diluent which is inert with respect to the said 2-electron oxidoreductase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The 2-electron oxidoreductase(s) in accordance with the invention preferably represent(s) from 0.01 to 20% by weight approximately relative to the total weight of the composition, and even more preferably from 0.1 to 5% by weight approximately relative to this weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, the term donor is understood to refer to the various substrates also necessary for the functioning of the said 2-electron oxidoreductase (s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The nature of the donor (or substrate) for the said enzyme varies depending on the nature of the 2-electron oxidoreductase used. For example, as donors for the pyranose oxidases, mention may be made of D-glucose, L-sorbose and D-xylose; as a donor for the glucose oxidases, mention may be made of D-glucose; as donors for the glycerol oxidases, mention may be made of glycerol and dihydroxyacetone; as donors for the lactate oxidases, mention may be made of lactic acid and its salts; as donors for the pyruvate oxidases, mention may be made of pyruvic acid and its salts; and lastly, as donors for the uricases, mention may be made of uric acid and its salts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The donor(s) (or substrate(s)) used in accordance with the invention preferably represent from 0.01 to 20% by weight approximately relative to the total weight of the composition in accordance with the invention, and even more preferably from 0.1 to 5% approximately relative to this weight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, unmodified or chemically modified nonionic guar gums can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The unmodified nonionic guar gums are, for example, the products sold under the name Vidogum GH 175 by the company Unipectine and under the name Jaguar C by the company Meyhall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The nonionic guar gums which can be used according to the invention are preferably modified with C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>hydroxyalkyl groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Among the hydroxyalkyl groups, mention may be made, for example, of hydroxymethyl, hydroxyethyl, hydroxypropyl and hydroxybutyl groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> These guar gums are well known in the state of the art and can be prepared, for example, by reacting corresponding alkene oxides, such as, for example, propylene oxides, with the guar gum, so as to obtain a guar gum modified with hydroxypropyl groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The degree of hydroxyalkylation, which corresponds to the number of alkylene oxide molecules consumed by the number of free hydroxyl functions present on the guar gum, preferably ranges from 0.4 to 1.2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Such nonionic guar gums optionally modified with hydroxyalkyl groups are sold, for example, under the trade names Jaguar HP8, Jaguar HP60 and Jaguar HP120, Jaguar DC 293 and Jaguar HP 105 by the company Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc (Meyhall) or under the name Galactasol 4H4FD2 by the company Aqualon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The concentration of nonionic guar gum can range from 0.01 to 10% by weight approximately relative to the total weight of the composition, and preferably between 0.1 and 5% approximately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> A subject of the present invention is also a ready-to-use composition for the oxidation dyeing of keratin fibres, and in particular human keratin fibres such as the hair, of the type comprising, in a medium which is suitable for dyeing, at least one oxidation base and, where appropriate, one or more couplers, which is characterized in that it contains: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> (a) at least one enzyme of 2-electron oxidoreductase type in the presence of at least one donor for the said enzyme, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> (b) at least one nonionic guar gum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The nature of the oxidation base(s) used in the ready-to-use dye composition is not a critical factor. They can be chosen, in particular, from para-phenylenediamines, double bases, para-aminophenols, ortho-aminophenols and heterocyclic oxidation bases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Among the para-phenylenediamines which can be used as oxidation bases in the dye compositions in accordance with the invention, mention may be made in particular of the compounds of formula (I) below, and the addition salts thereof with an acid:

<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The dye composition of the invention can also contain, in addition to the oxidation bases defined above and the optional combined couplers, direct dyes to enrich the shades with glints. These direct dyes can be chosen in particular from nitro dyes, azo dyes or anthraquinone dyes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The subject of the invention is also a process for dyeing keratin fibres, and in particular human keratin fibres such as the hair, using the ready-to-use dye composition as defined above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> According to this process, at least one ready-to-use dye composition as defined above is placed on the fibres, for a period which is sufficient to develop the desired coloration, after which the fibres are rinsed, optionally washed with shampoo, rinsed again and dried. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The time required to develop the coloration on the keratin fibres is generally between 3 and 60 minutes and even more precisely between 5 and 40 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> According to a first specific embodiment of the invention, the process includes a first step which consists in separately storing, on the one hand, a composition (A) comprising, in a medium which is suitable for dyeing, at least one oxidation base and optionally at least one coupler as defined above, and, on the other hand, a composition (B) containing, in a medium which is suitable for dyeing, at least one enzyme of 2-electron oxidoreductase type in the presence of at least one donor for the said enzyme and at least one nonionic guar gum containing at least one hydrophilic unit and at least one fatty chain, and then in mixing them together at the time of use, before applying this mixture to the keratin fibres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> According to another specific embodiment of the invention, the nonionic guar gum is incorporated into composition (A). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> Another subject of the invention is a multi-compartment dyeing device or &ldquo;kit&rdquo; or any other multi-compartment packaging system, a first compartment of which contains composition (A) as defined above and a second compartment of which contains composition (B) as defined above. These devices can be equipped with means for applying the desired mixture to the hair, such as the devices described in patent FR-2,586,913 in the name of the Applicant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> A subject of the present invention is also a novel process for treating keratin substances, in particular the hair, in order to obtain a permanent reshaping of this hair, in particular in the form of permanent-waved hair, this process comprising the following steps: (i) a reducing composition is applied to the keratin substance to be treated, the keratin substance being placed under mechanical tension before, during or after the said application, (ii) the keratin substance is optionally rinsed, (iii) an oxidizing composition as defined above is applied to the optionally rinsed keratin substance, (iv) the keratin substance is optionally rinsed again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The first step (i) of this process consists in applying a reducing composition to the hair. This application is carried out lock by lock or all at once. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The reducing composition comprises, for example, at least one reducing agent, which can be chosen in particular from thioglycolic acid, cysteine, cysteamine, glyceryl thioglycolate, thiolactic acid or thiolactic or thioglycolic acid salts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The usual step for placing the hair under tension in a shape corresponding to the desired final shape for this hair (for example curls) can be carried out by any suitable means, in particular mechanical means, known per se for maintaining the hair under tension, such as, for example, rollers, curlers and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The hair can also be shaped without the aid of external means, simply with the fingers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> Before carrying out the following optional rinsing step (ii), the hair onto which the reducing composition has been applied should, conventionally, be left to stand for a few minutes, generally between 5 minutes and one hour, preferably between 10 and 30 minutes, so as to give the reducing agent enough time to act correctly on the hair. This waiting phase preferably takes place at a temperature ranging from 35&deg; C. to 45&deg; C., while preferably also protecting the hair with a hood. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In the optional second step of the process (step (ii)), the hair impregnated with the reducing composition is then rinsed thoroughly with an aqueous composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Next, in a third step (step (iii)), the oxidizing composition of the invention is applied to the hair thus rinsed, with the aim of fixing the new shape given to the hair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> As in the case of the application of the reducing composition, the hair onto which the oxidizing composition has been applied is then, conventionally, left for a standing or waiting phase lasting a few minutes, generally between 3 and 30 minutes, preferably between 5 and 15 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> If the hair was maintained under tension by external means, these means (rollers, curlers or the like) can be removed from the hair before or after the fixing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> Lastly, in the final step of the process according to the invention (step (iv)), which is also optional, the hair impregnated with the oxidizing composition is rinsed thoroughly, generally with water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Hair which is soft and easy to disentangle is finally obtained. The hair is wavy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The oxidizing composition according to the invention can also be used in a process for bleaching keratin fibres, and in particular the hair. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The bleaching process according to the invention comprises a step of applying an oxidizing composition according to the invention to the keratin fibres in the presence or absence of an auxiliary oxidizing agent. Conventionally, a second step of the bleaching process according to the invention is a step of rinsing the keratin fibres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The medium which is suitable for the keratin fibres (or the support) for the ready-to-use dye compositions and for the oxidation compositions used for the permanent reshaping or bleaching of keratin fibres in accordance with the invention generally consists of water or of a mixture of water and at least one organic solvent in order to dissolve the compounds which would not be sufficiently soluble in water. By way of organic solvent, mention may be made, for example, of C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>-C<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>alkanols such as ethanol and isopropanol; glycerol; glycols and glycol ethers such as 2-butoxyethanol, propylene glycol, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and monomethyl ether, and aromatic alcohols such as benzyl alcohol or phenoxyethanol, similar products and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The solvents can be present in proportions preferably of between 1 and 40% by weight approximately relative to the total weight of the dye composition, and even more preferably between 5 and 30% by weight approximately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> The pH of the ready-to-use dye compositions and of the oxidizing compositions used for the permanent reshaping or bleaching of the keratin fibres in accordance with the invention is chosen such that the enzymatic activity of the 2-electron oxidoreductase is not adversely affected. It is generally between 5 and 11 approximately, and preferably between 6.5 and 10 approximately. It can be adjusted to the desired value using acidifying or basifying agents usually used for dyeing keratin fibres. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> Among the acidifying agents, mention may be made, by way of example, of inorganic or organic acids such as hydrochloric acid, orthophosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid or lactic acid, and sulphonic acids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> Among the basifying agents, mention may be made, by way of example, of aqueous ammonia, alkaline carbonates, alkanolamines such as mono-, di- and triethanolamines, 2-methyl-2-aminopropanol and derivatives thereof, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and the compounds of formula (V) below:
