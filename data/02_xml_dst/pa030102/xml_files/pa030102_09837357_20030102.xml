<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A photographic lens system for forming an object image is placed in the lens barrel of an electronic camera. In a camera body, a beam splitter for forming branched optical paths and an image sensing element for photoelectrically converting the formed object image are arranged. An optical filter attached to a filter cap is inserted between the beam splitter and the image sensing element. The filter cap intimately contacts with the perimeter of the exit surface of the beam splitter and the perimeter of the image sensing surface of the image sensing element, thereby forming closed spaces, between the optical filter and the beam splitter and between the optical filter and the image sensing element, which allow incident light to pass through. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from the prior Japanese Patent Applications No. 2000-123102, Apr. 24, 2000; and 2000-132672, May 1, 2000, the entire contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an electronic camera and, more particularly, to an electronic camera capable of preventing deterioration of the picture quality and deterioration of the quality of a finder image caused by adhesion of dust, and at the same time allowing easy replacement/disassembly of optical members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In an electronic camera, if dust adheres to an optical member through which incident light to an image sensing element passes, a photographed picture is influenced by the dust. When this is the case, it is highly likely that even rubbish of a very small size, i.e., dust, which is not a problem in a silver halide camera, appears as a black dot on a photographed frame and deteriorates the picture quality. This is mainly because the size of the image sensing surface of an image sensing element is smaller than that of a silver halide film used in a silver halide camera. Adhesion of dust to optical members is particularly a big problem for an image sensing element having a high pixel density (multiple pixels), because such an image sensing element is required to have a high picture quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In addition, the zoom magnification at the focusing plane of an optical finder of an electronic camera is larger than that of a silver halide camera. Therefore, even rubbish of a very small size, i.e., dust, which is of no problem in a silver halide camera is highly likely to appear as a black dot in a finder field and deteriorate the quality of a finder image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> To solve these problems, in a digital still camera disclosed in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 11-109203, a lens and an optical filter are fixed in a sealed state in a cylindrical sealing member, and this cylindrical sealing member is attached to a substrate for mounting an image sensing element so as to cover this image sensing element tightly. That is, in this camera, a closed space is formed between the lens and the optical filter through which incident light to the image sensing element passes, and around the image sensing element. This prevents deterioration of the picture quality caused by adhesion of dust. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In this digital still camera disclosed in Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 11-109203, however, once a unit including the components in the cylindrical sealing member is assembled, it is not easy to disassemble the unit in order to replace the parts in the cylindrical sealing member. That is, this conventional structure in which the optical members in the vicinity of the image sensing element are covered with the sealing member to thereby prevent invasion and adhesion of dust still has antinomic problems: improving the picture quality and facilitating replacement/disassembly of optical members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Also, a camera containing a focal-plane shutter having front and rear curtains is known as a silver halide camera (a camera using a silver halide film). Since the film surface must be shielded except during exposure in a silver halide camera, this focal-plane shutter operates as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Before exposure, the front curtain is always in a shielding position, and the rear curtain is in a retraction position. By a release operation, the front curtain moves to a retraction position to uncover the film surface, and the film surface is exposed to light. After a predetermined time has elapsed, the rear curtain in the retraction position moves to shield the film surface and complete the exposure. That is, the operation timings of the front and rear curtains determine the shutter speed. When the shutter speed is low (e.g., {fraction (1/500)} SEC or more), the rear curtain moves after the front curtain retracts. When the shutter speed is high, the rear curtain begins to move while the front curtain is moving. In this case, the exposure time is determined by the width (size) of a slit gap between the trailing end of the front curtain and the leading end of the rear curtain (slit shutter mode). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In an electronic camera, on the other hand, a time corresponding to the exposure time in a silver halide camera can be set by an element shutter which is defined by turn on/off of an image sensing element for photoelectric conversion, e.g., a CCD. However, even an electronic camera uses a mechanical shutter for the following reasons. First, an interlace CCD requires the operation of a mechanical shutter at the end of exposure. Second, a progressive CCD must be shielded by a mechanical shutter immediately after exposure is completed by an element shutter, in order to prevent smear (therefore, exposure is preferably terminated by a mechanical shutter). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For example, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 11-122542 disclosed an electronic camera containing a focal-plane shutter having only one of front and rear curtains. Also, Jpn. Pat. Appln. KOKAI Publication No. 11-218838 disclosed an electronic camera containing a focal-plane shutter having a large number of sectors functioning as a shutter which also serves as a stop. The latter publication also describes that a focal-plane shutter having front and rear curtains is also usable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In an electronic camera containing the conventional focal-plane shutter, e.g., in each of the electronic cameras disclosed in the above two publications, the shutter is placed closely in front of a CCD. This is so because the role of the focal-plane shutter is to shield the image sensing surface of the CCD. This similarly holds for a silver halide camera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The focal-plane shutter operates a considerable number of times at high speed. Therefore, wear caused by contact of the sectors produces wear dust. In a silver halide camera, deterioration of the picture quality caused by this wear dust is hardly a problem because the size of a silver halide film is large. However, as described previously, if wear dust adheres to the cover glass of a CCD in an electronic camera, this adhered wear dust appears as a black dot in a photographed frame and deteriorates the picture quality. The reasons are, for example, that the image sensing surface of a CCD is much smaller than a silver halide film, and the cover glass is very close to the image sensing surface. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing the outer appearance of an electronic camera according to an embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing the internal structure of the electronic camera. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is an enlarged sectional view showing the main parts of the electronic camera. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, this electronic camera <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a camera body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a lens barrel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> detachably attached to the front surface of a casing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also shows a two-step release switch <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for starting photographing, and a release terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a strobe terminal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> for connecting lines for remotely controlling release and strobe operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the lens barrel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, zoom lenses <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a stop <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a focusing lens <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are arranged in this order from the incident light side. The zoom lenses <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the focusing lens <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> construct a photographic lens system for forming an object image (in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the arrangement of these lenses is schematically shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> At the entrance of the camera body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (light guiding device or light splitting device) for splitting an incident optical image from the photographic lens system toward a CCD image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and an optical finder unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is placed. This beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is formed by combining two prisms, i.e., lower and upper prisms <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The CCD image sensing element (photoelectric conversion element) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> photoelectrically converts the incident object image formed on the image sensing surface, and outputs it as an electrical signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Two optical filters <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are inserted between the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The filter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is an IR cut filter for cutting infrared radiation, which is formed by deposition on a glass surface. The filter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is a low-pass filter for preventing moire, which is formed by stacking two or more quartz plates. These filters <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are integrated by adhesion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the optical filters <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, and the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are installed in a form to be described later in the camera body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a holding frame structure <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A first printed circuit board <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is placed at the back of this holding frame structure <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected to this first printed circuit board <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. In addition, a second printed circuit board <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is placed below the holding frame structure <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> so as to form a right angle to the first printed circuit board <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> An optical finder unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is attached to the holding frame structure <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in accordance with the optical path branched upward by the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This optical finder unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a finder frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> bent at a right angle. A focusing plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for focusing and a field frame plate <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> are attached to that side of the finder frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, which faces the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In this finder frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a plurality of lenses <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and a mirror <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are arranged (the lens arrangement is schematically shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The light beam split toward the optical finder unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is guided to a finder window at the back of the camera body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via these optical members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> An image display LCD <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is placed in the middle of the back surface of the camera body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This image display LCD <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is used as a photographic finder in recording mode and as a monitor for reproducing a recorded photographed picture in playback mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing the assembled state of the casing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the camera body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing the disassembled state of the casing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, this casing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is composed of a front cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a rear cover <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and an upper cover <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, all of which are metal products having a high thermal conductivity, e.g., aluminum diecast products. These covers <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are joined by using known screw members (not shown). The covers <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> are thermally connected as their contact surfaces intimately contact with each other, thereby constructing an integrated heat-radiating casing having large thermal capacity, i.e., the casing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, for radiating heat to the outside of the camera. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing the disassembled state of the holding frame structure <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference>, this holding frame structure <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes a prism frame (heat-transfer frame member) <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, a bottom plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and a rear plate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, all of which are metal products having a high thermal conductivity, e.g., aluminum diecast products. The holding frame structure <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also includes filter caps <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and a sealing member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> assembled inside the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. All of the filter caps <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and the sealing member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are products made from highly elastic materials, e.g., synthetic rubber molded products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is so constructed as to insert the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from the lower opening of this prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The bottom plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is fastened to the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> by using known screw members (not shown) so as to close this lower opening. The prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the bottom plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are thermally connected as their contact surfaces intimately contact with each other, thereby constructing an integrated heat-transfer frame member having large thermal capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> On the bottom surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, a leaf spring <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> for pressing the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a biased state at a predetermined position is disposed. The lower prism <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is positioned by the biasing force of this leaf spring <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. In this state, those contact surfaces <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at the upper and lower edges of the reference oblique surface of the lower prism <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, which protrude from the upper prism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, contact with corresponding stop surfaces <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, respectively, formed on the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The upper prism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is positioned as it is pushed against the reference oblique surface of the lower prism <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by the sealing member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The rear plate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is much larger than the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and intimately contacts with the rear surface of the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This rear plate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is fastened to the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> by using known screw members (not shown) so as to close the rear opening of the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The rear plate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is thermally connected to the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> as their contact surfaces intimately contact with each other, thereby forming a thick heat-transfer path from the rear plate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. A pair of slits <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed in this rear plate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. A lead frame <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> for electrically connecting the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is disposed through these slits <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 6</cross-reference>, the holding frame structure <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> further includes a front plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> placed on the front side of the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. This front plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is a metal product having a high mechanical strength and a high thermal conductivity, e.g., a steel plate product. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a perspective view showing the relationship between the front plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> of the holding frame structure <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the lens barrel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the front cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is fastened to the front plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> by using known screw members (not shown). This prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is thermally connected to the front plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> as their contact surfaces intimately contact with each other, thereby forming a thick heat-transfer path from the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to the front plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the front plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is fastened to the front cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by using known screw members (some screw members are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). This front plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is thermally connected to the front cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> as their contact surfaces intimately contact with each other, thereby forming a thick heat-transfer path from the front plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to the front cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Also, a portion of the lens barrel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> constructs a heat-radiating barrel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> for radiating heat to the outside of the camera. This heat-radiating barrel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is made of a thermally conductive material, e.g., aluminum. The rest of the lens barrel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed with a synthetic resin. The heat-radiating barrel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is fastened to the front plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> by using known screw members (not shown). This lens barrel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is thermally connected to the front plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> as their contact surfaces intimately contact with each other, thereby forming a thick heat-transfer path from the front plate <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to the heat-radiating barrel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> As described above, a thick heat-transfer path is formed from the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the casing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the camera body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and to the heat-radiating barrel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the lens barrel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, both having large thermal capacity, via the holding frame structure <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which includes, e.g., the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> having large thermal capacity. Since the heat generated by the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is rapidly released to the outside of the camera through this heat-transfer path, it is possible to prevent a rise of the temperature of the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and thereby prevent deterioration of the picture quality. In particular, the lens barrel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a large exposure area to the outside and hence has a high heat-radiating effect. Note that the members such as the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the holding frame structure <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> forming the heat-transfer path and the casing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the heat-radiating barrel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> for radiating heat to the outside of the camera are all originally necessary members. Therefore, the internal structure of the apparatus can be flexibly made compact without adding any extra members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the filter caps <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> assembled inside the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are separately molded products and fastened to the front and rear sides, respectively, of the integrated filters <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. These filter caps <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are inserted, as they hold the filters <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, into the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> from its rear opening, before the rear plate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is attached to the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The filter cap <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is positioned by abutting it against the exit surface of the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The filter cap <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is positioned by abutting it against an internal stop surface <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the filter cap <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has as its main portion a surrounding portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for holding the filter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by surrounding it. In addition, this filter cap <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has an extended portion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which intimately contacts with the perimeter of the exit surface of the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by elastic deformation, thereby forming, between the filter <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a substantially closed space through which incident light to the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> passes. Similarly, the filter cap <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> has as its main portion a surrounding portion <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for holding the filter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> by surrounding it. This filter cap <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> also has an extended portion <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which intimately contacts with the perimeter of the image sensing surface of the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by elastic deformation, thereby forming, between the filter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a substantially closed space through which incident light to the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> passes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the filters <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, and the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are assembled against the elasticity of the filter caps <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the surrounding portions <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>intimately contact with the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Since the filter caps <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> surround the whole perimeters of the filters <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, it is possible to reliably prevent damage to the edges of these filters <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and thereby prevent the generation of particles. Also, since the filter caps <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> form a substantially closed space surrounding the optical path between the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, deterioration of the picture quality caused by invasion and adhesion of dust can be prevented. Furthermore, the filter caps <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and the sealing member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> intimately contact only with the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This facilitates disassembling the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the filters <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, and the image sensing element <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, when any of these components is to be replaced. Although the filter caps <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are separate members in this embodiment, they can also be an integrated member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The sealing member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is attached to the upper opening of the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> which opens to the optical finder unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This sealing member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> has a flange portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in its upper portion. The sealing member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is positioned by clamping this flange portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in an intimate contact state between the prism frame <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and the finder frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The sealing member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> also has a cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which intimately contacts with the perimeter of the exit surface of the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by elastic deformation, thereby forming, between the focusing plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a substantially closed space through which incident light to the optical finder unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> passes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the finder frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> are assembled against the elasticity of the sealing member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the sealing member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> intimately contacts with the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the finder frame <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> That is, a substantially closed space is also formed for the optical finder unit <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, in the vicinity of the focusing plate <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, by the sealing member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Therefore, deterioration of the quality of a finder image caused by invasion and adhesion of dust can be prevented. Additionally, since the sealing member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> intimately contacts only with the beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, disassembly of the parts around this beam splitter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is not interfered with. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In the above embodiment, aluminum is used as the material of the front cover <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the rear cover <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and the upper cover <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the prism frame (heat-transfer frame member) <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, the bottom plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and the rear plate <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> of the holding frame structure <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, from the viewpoint of thermal conductivity and light weight. However, similar effects can be obtained even when zinc or magnesium is used as the material of these parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a sectional view showing the internal structure of an electronic camera according to another embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, this electronic camera <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a camera body <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and a lens barrel <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> detachably attached to the front surface of a casing <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> of the body <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> In the lens barrel <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, two zoom lenses <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, a stop <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and a focusing lens <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> are arranged along an optical path L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in this order from the incident light side. The two zoom lenses <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and the focusing lens <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> construct a photographic lens system for forming an object image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> At the entrance of the camera body <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a beam splitter <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> (light guiding device or light splitting device) for splitting an incident object image from the photographic lens system toward a CCD image sensing element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (an optical path L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and an optical finder unit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (an optical path L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) is placed. Between this beam splitter <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the image sensing element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a shutter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and two types of optical filters <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> are arranged along the optical path L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The shutter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is a focal-plane shutter having a front curtain <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and a rear curtain <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> to be opened and closed in a way to be described later. The filter <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is an IR cut filter for cutting infrared radiation. The filter <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> is a low-pass filter for preventing the generation of moire.

<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, when the release SW is turned on from the ready state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference> at the low shutter speed, the front curtain <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is first released to uncover the image sensing surface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In substantially synchronism with this, an element shutter (defined by turn on/off of the image sensing element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>) is turned on to start image sensing.

After that, the signal from the image sensing element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is transferred and read out. That is, a time (to be referred to as an exposure time hereinafter) corresponding to the exposure time of a silver halide camera is determined by the period from the ON of the element shutter to the shielding by the mechanical shutter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> On the other hand, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, when the shutter speed is high, the element shutter is already ON in the ready state shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</cross-reference>. When the release SW is turned on from this ready state, the front curtain <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is first released, and the rear curtain <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is then released to start moving while the front curtain <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is moving. In other words, the front and rear curtains <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> are released with a certain time lag between them and expose the image sensing surface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to light while running parallel to each other (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference>).

After that, the signal from the image sensing element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is transferred and read out. That is, a time (to be referred to as an exposure time hereinafter) corresponding to the exposure time of a silver halide camera is determined by the width (size) of a slit gap <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>between the trailing end of the front curtain <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the leading end of the rear curtain <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> (slit shutter mode). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In the electronic camera according to this embodiment, the shutter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is positioned away from the image sensing surface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the image sensing element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, compared to the conventional electronic camera. For example, the arrangement of the optical parts of the electronic camera <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of this embodiment is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. However, when these optical parts are arranged in accordance with the structure of the conventional electronic camera, the arrangement is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. Hence, the camera is influenced by the aperture area (aperture diameter) of the stop <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> more strongly than in the conventional structure. That is, in slit shutter mode when the shutter speed is high, the exposure time of the image sensing surface largely changes in accordance with the aperture diameter of the stop <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> for the same shutter speed. This will be explained below. </paragraph>

When this is the case, the diameter d of the light beam is much smaller than the width S of the slit <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Accordingly, the width S of the slit <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the shutter speed v are dominant as elements for determining the exposure time T. That is, this exposure time T is not largely influenced by the aperture diameter D of the stop <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> By contrast, when the shutter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is in the position P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> away from the image sensing surface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>as in the structure of this embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, the value of the distance x is smaller than that of the focal length f, so the diameter d of the light beam at the shutter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> has a relatively large value. In this case, the diameter d of the light beam has a value not small when compared to the width S of the slit <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in equation (1). In addition, the diameter d of the light beam greatly changes in accordance with a change in the aperture diameter D of the stop <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>.

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, if the diameters d<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and d<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the light beam are about four and two times, respectively, the width S of the slit <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, exposure times T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the image sensing surface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>when the aperture diameter of the stop <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is set to F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and F<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> have a ratio of 5:3 from equation (1), i.e., they are largely different from each other, even for the same shutter speed v. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> To solve this problem, in the electronic camera <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> according to this embodiment, the shutter driving controller <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> controls driving of the front and rear curtains <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> in accordance with the set value of the aperture area of the stop <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> formed by the system controller <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and with the set value of the shutter speed of the shutter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, such that the exposure time of the image sensing surface <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is equal to a predetermined exposure time to be obtained by the set value of the shutter speed.

The beam splitter <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> can be moved between a position Pr at which the direction of a light beam passing through a photographic lens system is changed toward the optical finder and a position Ps at which this light beam is passed toward an image sensing element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</cross-reference>, the shutter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is similarly disposed away from the image sensing element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and closer to the incident light side than filters <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it is possible to prevent adhesion of wear dust from the focal-plane shutter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> to the image sensing surface of the image sensing element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and thereby avoid deterioration of the picture quality. In these embodiments, as in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, it is desirable to form a substantially closed space for preventing invasion of dust and the like, between the image sensing element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the optical member (in this case, the filter <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>) closely in front of the image sensing element <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, by using an appropriate holding frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In each of the above embodiments, the focal-plane shutter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is the shutter <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> having the front and rear curtains <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. However, the present invention is also applicable to a focal-plane shutter having only one curtain (sector) or a large number of sectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages and modifications will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to the specific details and representative embodiments shown and described herein. Accordingly, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
