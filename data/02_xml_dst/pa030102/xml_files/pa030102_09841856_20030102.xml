<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates in general to reaching and recovering the natural heat found in rock deep within the earth, more specifically to laser drilling a dry hole under a vacuum and using the heat with a closed circulating heat recovery system, to produce geothermal electricity. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Geothermal energy is the earths most plentiful renewable resource and has not fully reached its potential. The heat deep within the earth has been known of for many centuries, this heat has been displayed as volcanos, geysers, and even hot springs. In some geothermal locations found around the earth, pools of super hot water have been trapped beneath a cap, or a layer of impermeable rock. these areas are known as wet geothermal zones. This is where geothermal energy has it&apos;s infancy. Wells have been successfully drilled into these pools. The heated water has been used in various ways to generate mechanical power, then harnessed to generate electricity. However the industry is still struggling with problems, such as the minerals and salts carried in the water, causing maintenance difficulties. The depletion of the well pressure and replenishing the reservoir have been problems. Also the geothermal industry has been limited to the wet geothermal zones, which are not always near the metropolitan areas where electric power is needed. This has left the dry geothermal zones virtually untapped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention is well suited to take geothermal energy to the next level, by utilizing old and well known technologies, with a few new apparatuses to circumvent the barriers of drilling an ultra deep hole into the dry geothermal zone, found everywhere beneath the surface of the earth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Heretofore, drilling a bore-hole into the earth is a well known art, and accomplished in several ways, all having limitations to drilling an ultra deep hole. The most common method of drilling is used in the search of oil and gas, this method uses a drilling fluid or mud, the mud is pumped down the drill pipe to flush the drill cuttings from the hole. This mud or fluid could not withstand the temperatures of an ultra deep hole. U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,654 to Carroll et al, shows a high temperature drilling fluid, that would also fall short of the temperatures expected. Other setbacks include the weight of a fluid column this tall would be difficult to pump, even the added weight of conventional drill pipe may cause problems, also the time it takes to periodically pull the drill string to replace the rotary drill bit is a setback. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Lasers have been used for drilling, one has a plurality of lasers focused to bore horizontally, U.S. Pat. No. 3,693,718 to Stout. U.S. Pat. No. 3,871,485 to Keenan Jr, shows a generator and laser mounted within the drill string, with mud or drilling fluid driving a turbine to power it. U.S. Pat. No. 3,977,478 to shuck, shows a sealed hole that has been pressurized for laser drilling, however even more pressure is required as the hole deepens, setting limitations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A vacuum is utilized in the present invention, used to remove vapors, ash and gases from the hole, also to create a sub-atmospheric condition within the hole. this air flow will also keep smoke and vapors away from the reflecting surfaces. Many devices have been used to achieve a vacuum, such as these U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,069,582 to Young, 4,745,655 to Johnson, and 5,768,743 to Webster, all of these use a positive air flow, have chambers and air ducts, some use compressed air and one uses a fan. All of these vacuum producing devices lack the power needed for the task at hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For heat recovery from geothermal wells, wet or dry, many systems have been developed but insofar as the applicant is aware, none of these incorporate a closed double D pipe circulation system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The description of two new apparatuses will help enable one skilled in the art to better understand and utilize the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The first apparatus added to this new method of laser drilling is an evacuator, utilized to apply a sub-atmospheric pressure to the drill hole, enhancing the lasers effective range and removing the smoke, ashes and gases produced by laser drilling, with a constant air flow circulating within the drill hole. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>an evacuator can be described as a bulbous shaped vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, condensing conically to a cylindrical elongated opening <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Situated around and extending beyond the elongated opening <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, is the cylindrical extension duct <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, moved extensionally by actuators <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. Mounted steady and centered within the elongated opening <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, is the air duct <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a cylindrical pipe, open at both ends and extending from the elongated opening&apos;s throat, curving upwardly in a sweeping curve, then exiting through the wall of the chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as it curves to a parallel position with the elongated opening <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Mounted within the air duct&apos;s end, exterior of the chamber, is a fan driven by an engine. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a turbine engine <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, is mounted in the air duct at the elongated opening&apos;s end as an alternate source of propulsion. Opposite of the elongated opening <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, is the vacuum pipe <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, entering through the wall of the chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. At the bottom most part of the chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, is the entry hatch <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the vacuum pipe <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, is bolted to the vacuum manifold <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. The vacuum manifold <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, holds the seal <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, around the drill pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and is bolted on top of a blow-out prevention valve at the well head. The well&apos;s surface casing <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, extends to bedrock to anchor the well head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The second apparatus added is the rotating mirror housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, used to reflect the laser beam to different areas of the bottom surface of the hole. Referring to the drawings in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the rotating mirror housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is a cylindrical metal housing, having a substantial wall there around, with a smaller outside diameter in the lower section, leaving a shoulder <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, there around the housing. The shoulder <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, setting and rotating on needle bearings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. A support ring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, holds the bearings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, and the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, within the bottom of the drill pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Spaced around the outside wall of the upper section of the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, are roller recesses <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, cut for the rollers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, that are held in place and rotate on roller pins <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The roller pins <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, are installed through the rollers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, from the top surface of the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Mounted to the top surface of the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and having the same inside diameter as the housing is the ring gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The ring gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, with outwardly pointing teeth, has a smaller outside diameter than the upper section of the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, leaving space for the drive gear <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The inside wall of the rotating mirror housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, has been sectionally machined to have small flat surfaces for the angled mirrors <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, all cut at different angles from a horizontal and vertical plane, to reflect the laser beam <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, to various positions of the bottom surface of the hole. One of these machined surfaces is cut very short in width, and at such an angle as to reflect a pulse of the laser beam <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, upward, as it passes through the beam, to be captured by the light sensitive diode <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the light sensitive diode receiver is mounted under the laser generator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This pulse of laser light from the timing mirror <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, is used for determining the revolutions per minute (RPM) of the rotating mirror housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The angled surfaces of the housing can be polished brightly, as to efficiently reflect the laser beam <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, or mirrors can be fastened to them. The rotation of the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is provided by the air flow through the drill pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, acting on the fan of the drive mechanism, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>When the fan <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, turns it drives the input gear <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, also connected to input shaft <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which drives the idler gear <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, on the idler shaft <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, that drives the transfer gear <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, turning the drive gear <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, through the output shaft <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The drive gear <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> turns the rotating housing by driving the ring gear <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The fan and gears are keyed to the shafts in a normal fashion and the shafts are held in position between the lower housing <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and the upper housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, with retainers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the drill pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, suspended in the elevators of a drilling rig in the normal fashion. Mounted above the drill pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is the laser generator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, emitting the laser beam <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, down the drill pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Mounted under the generator is the multiple targeting radar gun <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and the light sensitive diode receiver <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, with it&apos;s collecting mirror. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the laser beam <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, traveling near the inner wall of the drill pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, striking the stationary mirror <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, a conical shaped reflecting device having a larger diameter at the top, condensing to a smaller diameter at the bottom of the device, fitting and mounted inside the drill pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, reflecting the laser beam <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, to the rotating mirror housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, striking one of the angled mirrors <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, reflecting the beam to the bottom of the hole. As the rotating mirror housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, turns, each of the angled mirrors is brought into the path of the beam and reflects it to different parts of the hole. The housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is ridding on needle bearings <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, mounted in the bottom of the drill pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, on the support ring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>.

As the stock rolls to the edge of the flat section, now to be the center wall, the extra welder would join the wall to the inside surface of the stock still being rolled, this would have a D shape, the rolling process then continues until the final edge reaches the first bend and then welded there, becoming a double D pipe. For joining the pipe vertically, a chamfer or groove is cut into the center wall of both ends, when the two pieces come together, a tenon or key is placed into the groove, now the two pipes can be aligned and welded together. For added strength a slip collar could be placed over the weld and welded to both sections of pipe. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> After the spud-in process is completed, the surface casing and the blow-out prevention valve are put in place in the normal fashion. The vacuum manifold <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, is bolted on top of the blow-out prevention valve <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and the vacuum pipe <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, is connected to the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The first section of drill pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, with the stationary mirror <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and the rotating mirror housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, mounted inside, is lowered through the seal <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, into the hole. At this point the radar gun <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, is turned on, this is to measure the relationship between the rotating mirror housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the bottom of the hole. The drill is lowered to bring the rotating mirror housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, to a close relationship to the bottom of the hole, this distance will vary depending on the diameter of the hole desired. When the drill is in position the evacuator <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, is started. As the vacuum is applied to the hole, air begins to flow down through the drill pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, past the rotating housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, turning the fan <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, on the drive mechanism <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>which rotates the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The air flow returns to the surface and into the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, through the manifold <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, and vacuum pipe <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>. When the air flow is up to speed a vacuum will be present within the hole, indicated by a vacuum gauge at the operators station. The laser generator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is now turned on and the beam is brought into phase. A tachometer will indicate to the operator that the rotating mirror housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is up to speed. The tachometer receives this information from the light sensitive diode <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, receiving a pulse of the laser beam <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, each time the timing mirror <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, passes through the laser beam. The laser beam is fired down the drill pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, striking the stationary mirror <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, then into the rotating mirror housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The laser beam is then reflected to different spots on the bottom of the hole as the angled mirrors <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, pass by. The operator now lowers the drill pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, into the hole at a rate as to keep the rotating housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, at the determined distance from the bottom of the hole with the information returned by the radar gun <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. When more drill pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is needed as the hole progresses, the laser generator is turned off, time is allowed for the evacuator <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, to clear the hole of smoke, then the evacuator is turned off. Slips or clamps are set in place to secure the drill pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, while the elevators of the rig are released and raised to latch onto the next section of drill pipe and lift it to make the connection to the previous piece of drill pipe. When the connection is complete the slips are removed and the evacuator is started again, when the vacuum is established the laser generator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is started and drilling continues. As the hole progresses deeper, focus lenses may be required and installed into the drill pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, also inert gases such as argon or nitrogen may be introduced at the top of the drill string. When the evacuator <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, becomes full of debris, drawn from the hole, it can be emptied during a drill pipe connection, while it is shut down, by opening the entry hatch <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. At the completion of the hole, determined by the temperature of the rock reached, the laser generator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is turned off, time is given to evacuate the hole, then the evacuator is shut down and the drill pipe is removed. The slips are used each time a drill pipe connection is broken to keep the remaining drill pipe from falling into the hole. When the drill pipe is removed, the vacuum manifold <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, is removed as is the blow-out prevention valve. With only the surface casing <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, left in the hole, the double D pipe of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>can be installed. The first section of double D pipe is the end cap piece, as shown in the lower section of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The rig lowers this piece into the hole, until about 5 feet are left exposed above the floor of the rig, the slips are set, the elevators are released and raised to lift the next section of double D pipe. The tenon or key is installed into the center wall of the first pipe, the center walls are aligned as the upper pipe is lowered to make contact. The two pipes are then welded together. The slips are removed and the upper section, now connected to the lower section, is lowered into the well, the slips are set and the next connection can be made. This process is repeated until the double D pipe reaches the bottom of the hole. A splitter pipe, as shown in the upper section of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, is installed at the top of the double D pipe and ran to the steam chamber, after leaving the steam chamber, two t&apos;s with valves are installed in the pipe, for filling the system, then the pipe is ran to the pump and back to the splitter, completing the circuit. The system can now be filled. Filling the system is accomplished with the two t&apos;s in the pipe, one to fill and the other to bleed off the air in the system. For backup reasons a second pump should be plumbed into the system, primed and isolated with valves. </paragraph>
