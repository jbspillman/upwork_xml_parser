<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A recombinant nucleic acid sequence comprising an SOS regulated promoter with an induction ratio higher than 40, said promoter being operatively linked to a reporter encoding nucleic acid sequence encoding a reporter resulting in a signal that can be assayed as light production. A biosensor comprising such a nucleic acid sequence and methods for determining genotoxicity and the presence of multiple genotoxic compounds using such a biosensor are disclosed. </paragraph>
</subdoc-abstract>
<subdoc-description>
<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> There are at present various screening methods for genotoxic and/or toxic compounds using microorganisms. The Ames test (Maron and Ames, 1983) appears to be the most widely used test for toxic compounds and is as such recommended worldwide. It however takes about three days for completion of the test with the obvious concomitant disadvantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Some short term methods have been introduced wherein the SOS response caused by DNA damage is measured as an amount of &bgr;-galactosidase expressed by the lacZ gene positioned downstream of the umuD,C or sfiA stress induced promoters that are SOS regulated. These tests are known respectively as the umu test (Oda et al. 1985) using <highlight><italic>Salmonella typhimurium </italic></highlight>as host microorganism and SOS chromotest (Quillardat et al., 1982) using <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>as host microorganism. In the umu test and SOS chromotest the host microorganism is cultured in the presence of the sample to be tested and subsequently the host microorganism is disrupted. A substrate for &bgr;-galactosidase is then added and the ensuing reaction is terminated after some 10 minutes by addition of an inhibitor followed by OD measurement at two wave lengths and calculation or &bgr;-galactosidase activity. These tests overcome the long timespan problem of the Ames test, however, have their own disadvantages. The sensitivity is low and detection times are still a lengthy 7-8 hours. In particular the detection sensitivity of nitroarenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is low. In addition the detection method requires a large number of actions and additions of various reagents thereby rendering the method complicated and expensive. Due to the fact that the cell has to be disrupted in order to carry out detection of any induction it is only possible to carry out one measurement on the cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> EP-A-0.649.905 discloses that some of the disadvantages of the aforementioned tests can be overcome by placing an SOS gene upstream of a gene expressing luciferase activity such that luciferase expression occurs simultaneously with expression of the SOS gene. Subsequently a mutagenic substance can be detected or measured in a short time by measuring the luminescence. Any SOS gene is stated as being useful and the umuD,C gene (as used in the umu test) is illustrated in the examples. The sensitivity of this test is stated to be increased in comparison to that of the conventional tests i.e. the SOS chromotest and the umu test because of the smaller sample volume required for detection measurement. No relevance is attached to the promoter to be used other than the fact it must be SOS inducible. As luminescence production is immediate the measurement can occur earlier than with the lac system thereby shortening the detection time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In WO 94/13831 DuPont also disclose the use of stress inducible promoters in combination with a luminescence gene complex to provide a genetically engineered microorganism. They state &ldquo;although stress responses have been demonstrated to be useful in detecting the presence of various environmental insults it has yet to be linked to a sensitive easily detected reporter&rdquo;. DuPont provides an extensive list of stress inducible promoters known in the state of the art that could be useful according to them but to which the invention is not restricted. This list comprises promoters from the following regulatory circuits: heat shock, SOS, hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, fatty acid starvation, universal stress, resting state, stringent, catabolite activation, P utilisation and N utilisation. In the Examples they use the heat shock regulated protein promoters dnaK and grpE, the SOS regulated promoters recA and uvrA, the oxidative damage regulated promoters katG and micF, the universal stress promoter uspA, the stationary phase promoter xthA, the his promoter from the amino acid starvation circuit, the lac promoter involved with the carbon starvation circuit, the phoA promoter from the phosphate limitation circuit and the glnA promoter from the nitrogen limitation circuit. This large number of examples from such a broad range of differently regulated promoters presumably serves to illustrate the broad applicability of their system. No preference is expressed or deducible for any particular group of promoters or any individual promoter. The only explicit reference to a specific SOS regulated promoter occurs in one of the examples (example 12 of the patent application) in which results with the SOS regulated promoter recA are presented. After exposing the microorganism to samples with the mutagen ethidium bromide at a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml an induction ratio of 1.9 was measured in one measurement after 180 minutes of the addition of mutagen. After addition of 0.5 &mgr;g/ml mitomycin C, the induction ratio&apos;s were measured after 100 minutes. Depending on the test strain used they varied between 4.7 to 20. This is apparent from Example 12 of the DuPont application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Unexpectedly we have found a subgroup of stress induced promoters, in fact a subgroup of SOS regulated promoters which in combination with a luminescence reporter can be used in a microorganism system for assessing mutagenicity with improved results. This subgroup does not include the SOS regulated RecA promoter. This subgroup offers a number of advantages over the DuPont RecA-luciferase system and the other microbial toxicity testing sytems of the state of the art. In further testing and developing these new systems by mutating the promoters in a specific manner we were able to improve performance even more. In addition novel methods of testing were carried out. These novel methods of testing result in obtaining more and better data hitherto not described for any of the existing microbial toxicity tests. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The subject invention is directed at a recombinant nucleic acid sequence comprising an SOS regulated promoter with an induction ratio higher than 40, said promoter being operatively linked to a reporter encoding nucleic acid sequence encoding a reporter resulting in a signal that can be assayed as light production. Preferably a promoter with an even higher induction ratio, preferably higher than 50 is present in the recombinant nucleic acid sequence according to the invention. The induction ratio can e.g. be determined as disclosed by M. Schnurr et al. in Biochimie (1991) 73, 423-431. Alternatively the method disclosed by Peterson K. R. and Mount D. W. (1987), J. Mol. Biol. 193, 27-40 can be used. The disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference. The recA promoter disclosed in the state of the art in combination with luciferase does not fall within this category as the induction ratio of recA is appreciably lower. It is 11&times; at 30&deg; C. which is the incubation temperature of the test. The induction ratio is an art recognised term and can be ascertained in a manner known per se for a person skilled in the art. In the literature Examples are given of how the induction ratio can be and has been ascertained together with numerical values for a number of promoters. The low induction ratio of recA is probably the reason why it is not particularly suited for a sensitive detection system based on promoter induction. The RecA promoter is the earliest promoter to be induced in the SOS regulated system. The signal(s) generated by metabolic defect(s) is (are) sensed by RecA protein. It also purportedly has a second function in mutagenesis in assisting DNA polymerase to bypass lesions. During the first twenty minutes after DNA damage the uvrA.B.C,D genes are activated to commence with excision repair. Then the recombinatorial repair pathway known as the RecF recombination pathway is very active during approximately 40 minutes. Finally, the SOS mutagenesis pathway involving umu D.C is induced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The lowest level of mytomycin C that was used in the dupont system as illustrated in the above cited patent application was 500 ng/ml. No indication or suggestion of detection of lower levels is given. In the subject systems 7 ng/ml of mytomycin can be detected. This system is thus approximately 80 times more sensitive than the DuPont system has been illustrated to be. We found induction ratios higher than 2 from a concentration of 7.5 ng/ml in our system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> We illustrate for the first time on line measurement. On line measurement was not possible with the SOS or Ames test because of the disruption of the cell required. The other tests described have also only been used for single point determinations. We have now discovered it is possible to distinguish the presence of multiple mutagens in a sample and to determine the induction kinetics of such substances. It was totally unexpected that the presence of multiple mutagens would provide detectably different signals when following the luminescence development in time. One would to the contrary have expected a cumulative effect to arise. It is however clearly illustrated that the SOS regulated promoters form a group of promoters that exhibit such characteristics of regulation that the induction pattern differs sufficiently for various inducing chemicals to present differentiated detectable signals. The novel method is extremely simple to apply and the detection of signal can be automated. The novel method merely requires culturing a microorganism comprising an SOS regulated promoter, said promoter being operatively linked to a reporter encoding nucleic acid sequence, said reporter resulting in a signal that can be assayed as light production and contacting the microorganism with the sample to be tested followed by </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> measuring the luminescence of the culture, said measuring occurring at various points in time and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> determining the signal to noise ratio at said points in time, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> plotting the data, said data representing the kinetics of genotoxicity of said sample with multiple peaks being indicative of multiple genotoxicity compounds with different induction kinetics. Preferably the luminescence measurements are continuous. Preferably the method is carried out on line. The examples and concomitant figures illustrate the fact that various peaks are detectable with samples comprising multiple mutagens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment the luminescence determination occurs continuously. This is particularly interesting from the point of view of automation as well as accuracy of determination of the presence of multiple genotoxic agents. The higher the signal to noise ratio the more sensitive the testing system is. Other factors that are of interest are the speed of induction, the degree of expression and the degree of fluctuation in signal to noise ratio. These factors can vary depending not only on the selected promoter but also on the host strain and the nature of the genotoxic agents. For practical uses the signal to noise ratio will be equal to or higher than 2 for 2 concentrations of genotoxic compound. A person skilled in the art will select the system best suited to their situation on the basis of one or a number of the aforementioned characteristics. The following examples illustrate the broad applicability of the novel biosensor systems. Results are shown of a number of the novel biosensor systems according to the invention consisting of various embodiments of the novel DNA sequences according to the invention in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and in <highlight><italic>S. typhimurium </italic></highlight>strains. All the novel biosystems tested were better than the standard Ames and SOS chromotests which ar based on <highlight><italic>S. typhimurium </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strains. The systems according to the invention were faster, more acccurate and more sensitive. We illustrate clearly for agents known to provide false negative results in the SOS chromotest and the Ames test that the novel systems according to the invention provide positive results where the known tests indeed provide false negative results. Specifically this is illustrated for novobiocine, sodiumazide, mitomycin C, naladixic acid, hydrogen peroxide, pyrene and phenantrene. The test systems according to the invention are particularly suited for detecting the presence of PAH&apos;s (&equals;polyaromatic hydrocrbons). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In addition the systems according to the invention do not require disruption in order to provide a measurement which is why they can subsequently be used for further testing and more importantly can provide a detectable signal over a period of time. Thus the induction kinetics of samples can be followed and determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> An important embodiment of the invention lies in the fact that now for the first time a method for determining the presence of multiple genotoxic compounds in a sample has become available, said method comprising the steps of </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> culturing a host microorganism, said host microorganism comprising a nucleic acid sequence comprising an SOS regulated promoter, said promoter being operatively linked to a reporter encoding nucleic acid sequence encoding a reporter resulting in a signal that can be assayed as light production, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> measuring the luminescence of the culture, said measuring occurring at various points in time, preferably continuously and determining the signal to noise ratio at said points in time, plotting the data, said data representing the kinetics of genotoxicity of said sample with multiple peaks being indicative of multiple genotoxicity compounds with different induction kinetics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Due to selection of the novel DNA sequences and employment thereof in host cells rendering novel biosensor systems we have also created very sensitive and fast biosystems. The genoxicity of a sample can be ascertained within a time period of 5 minutes to two hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention thus comprises a method for determining the presence of a genotoxic compound in a sample, said method comprising the steps of </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> culturing a host microorganism, said host microorganism comprising a nucleic acid sequence comprising an SOS regulated promoter with an induction ratio higher than 20, said promoter being operatively linked to a reporter encoding nucleic acid sequence encoding a reporter resulting in a signal that can be assayed as light production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> measuring the luminescence of the culture at multiple point in time and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> determining whether the luminescence of the culture has changed, increased luminescence being indicative of the presence of a genotoxic compound. Preferably the induction ratio of the promoter will be 40 or more, suitably 50 or more. In the aforementioned method for determining the presence of a genotoxic compound in a sample, a preferred embodiment comprises measuring of luminescence at multiple points in time. Preferably the measurements are carried out continuously. Preferably in addition the steps of </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> determining the signal to noise ratio of luminescence at said points in time and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> plotting the luminescence signal to noise data, said plot representing the kinetics of genotoxicity or said sample for determining the kinetics of genotoxicity of a sample. The aforementioned methods are preferably carried out with the biosensors according to the invention. Such biosensors comprise a host strain comprising the novel nucleic acid sequence according to the invention as defined elsewhere in this description. Preferably the host strain is a microorganism such as an <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>or <highlight><italic>S. typhimurium </italic></highlight>strain. In particular the standard <highlight><italic>S. typhimurium </italic></highlight>Ames test strains have been applied as host strains and provide very suitable embodiments of a biosensor according to the invention. Strains according to the invention offer the attraction of being suited for both genotoxicity and toxicity testing. Examples of Ames test strains are TA98, TA100, TA102, TA104, TA1535 and TA1538 or the new <highlight><italic>S. typhimurium </italic></highlight>strains TA7001 to TA7006 and TA7046 (Gee et al., 1994). Also the Ames strains are standard strains that are acceptable world wide in the pharmaceutical industry. In the case of the biosensor according to the invention comprising an Ames strain as host cell the strain cannot only be used for genotoxicity testing according to the invention but also subsequently for the Ames test as such. Other suitable host strains that can thus become multifunctional will be obvious to a person skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Various embodiments of the nucleic acid sequence according to the invention suitable for application in a biosensor according to the invention are illustrated in the examples. A nucleic acid sequence comprising an SOS regulated promoter with an induction ratio higher than 40, said promoter being operatively linked to a reporter encoding nucleic acid sequence encoding a reporter resulting in a signal that can be assayed as light production is part of the invention. Biosensors according to the invention comprise such a nucleic acid sequence in any of the various embodiments disclosed herein. Such a DNA sequence is furthermore suitable for carrying out all the methods according to the invention as disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Suitable promoters from the recombinatorial repair promoters consist of the group RecF, RecJ, RecN, RecO, RecQ, ruv and uvrD promoters. The RecN promoter is illustrated in the examples. Another suitable promoter is the SfiA promoter which is also illustrated in the examples. In addition mutated promoters of the aforementioned group of SOS regulated promoters induced during recombinatorial repair having an induction ratio higher than 40 are also suitable embodiments. Such mutants may have increased promoter strength or regulation but it is vital the SOS regulation is not destroyed. An example of an extremely suitable mutation comprises a mutation in at least one LexA binding site, whereby at least one other LexA binding site remains active. A preferred mutation of this type will have a mutation in the at least one other LexA binding site that does not alter the wild type promoter sequence. An example of this type of mutant is the RecN mutant with sequence id no 7 (RecN1-3). The type of mutant with LexA mutation is particularly useful in the method of determining presence of multiple genotoxic agents and determining induction kinetics of such samples in the methods according to the invention as disclosed elsewhere in the description. Such mutants are also extremely sensitive and fast. They are particularly useful for determining the appearance and/or accumulation of genotoxic intermediate degradation or metabolic products. This can be in the field of pollutants and degradation thereof for example bioremediation of soil. This can also be useful in drug testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Another type of mutant that has been found to provide useful characteristics is a mutation comprising a promoter up mutation. A promoter up mutation is an art recognised term, wherein the mutation is such that the promoter sequence more closely resembles that of the consensus sequence for the RNA polymerase binding site. Such a type of mutation can comprise a mutation in the promoter -35 region. An example for the RecN promoter of this type of mutation is provided in the examples in the form of RecN 2-4 mutant with sequence id. no. 8. We also provide an example of a combined mutant with both LexA and promoter up mutations in the form of the RecN 3-4 mutant with sequence id no 9. In principle other improvements are possible such as mutations in the -10 promoter region and better spacing between the -35 and -10 region. These latter two options were not relevant for recN as this promoter already exhibits good correspondence to the &sgr;<highlight><superscript>35 </superscript></highlight>promoter sequence. As the -35 was not optimal we illustrated that a mutation rendering a closer correspondence to the &sgr;<highlight><superscript>35 </superscript></highlight>consensus promoter sequence resulted in an improvement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In addition to the promoter sequence the nucleic acid sequence according to the invention also comprises a reporter encoding nucleic acid sequence encoding a reporter resulting in a signal that can be assayed as light production. Such sequences are known in the state of the art. A suitable embodiment is formed by a reporter encoding nucleic acid sequence comprising the luciferase A and B genes. In a preferred embodiment the sequence further comprises the luciferase C, D and E genes required for producing the limiting fatty acids substrate that is used in recycling. Details of such sequences can be found in PCT/EP patent application 9200445 with filing date Feb. 28, 1992. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A preferred method according to the invention comprises applying a microorganism suitable as Ames test strain, said microorganism further comprising a novel nucleic acid sequence according to the invention in any of the methods according to the invention described herein followed by a classical Ames test, thereby providing a method of genotoxicity mutagenicity and toxicity testing using the same strain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Another application of the novel nucleic acid sequences according to the invention lies in use of a host microorgaanism comprising said sequence for determining toxicity. A preferred host cell is one capable of a high noise signal. For example nucleic acid sequences according to the invention with promoterup mutation as described above appear very suitable for this application. Such application can lead to IC50 calculation of toxic products. In other words a method for determining the presence of a toxic compound in a sample, said-method comprising the steps of </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> culturing a host microorganism, said host microorganism being a host microorganism according to the invention as disclosed in any of the embodiments herein, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> measuring the luminescence of the culture and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> determining whether the luminescence of the culture has changed, decreased luminescence being indicative of the presence of a toxic compound is comprised within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In summary the following advantages of the invention can be given: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The possibility is created of discerning the presence of at least two genotoxic compounds presenting different induction kinetics in a sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The possibility is created of identifying in time the formation of intermediate genotoxic products during their metabolisation with S9 for example or degradation e.g. in bioremediation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Kinetics of genotoxicity as well as general toxicity can be detected on line with the same cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A rapid test with a clear answer can be provided within a time of 5 minutes to 4 hours, preferably within 3 hours, more preferably within 2 hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> No preliminary treatment of the cell culture prior to signal detection is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> No disruption of the cells is required for on line detection of genotoxic compounds or general toxicity of a liquid solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Selected substances found to be genotoxic within 4 hours, preferably within 3 hours, more preferably within 2 hours can be further examined with the strains according to the invention for frame shift mutations or base pair substitutions with the same cells according to the Ames procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> There is no need for internal controls for toxicity because the decrease in basic light production is indicatoive of general toxicity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Due to the limited test time of the experiment no strict sterile conditions are needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Due to the limited test time of the experiment no chemical stability tests for the test sample are needed.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The sfiA promoter of <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli: </italic></highlight>construction of sfiA-lux fusion </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The bacterial SOS response is under control of a number of regulatory proteins, from which the RecA protein (protease) and the LexA repressor are the most important. The presence of genotoxic products results in DNA damage. This will activate a DNA repair system, and part of this activation is the change from the inactive RecA protein to an active protease. This RecA protease has high affinity for the LexA repressor, that will become inactivated due to the proteolytic action of RecA. Inactivation of LexA followed by dissociation with its binding sites of LexA regulated promoters will result in activation of the promoters and transcription of their corresponding genes. One of the promoters under control of LexA is the sfiA promoter. The sfiA promoter has one LexA binding site that overlaps with the -10 region and the transcription start point of this promoter, and transcription activation requires the dissociation of LexA. It is also known that the sfiA promoter is one of the strongest promoters under control of the bacterial SOS response with an induction ratio of 100. The sfiA promoter was cloned as a PCR fragment. Primers were designed on the published sfiA sequence in such a manner that the PCR fragment would be flanked by a HindIII and an EcoR I restriction site. (Beck and Bremer 1980) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Primer 94C97 (Sequence id. no. 1) recognises the sfiA sequence from pos. 59 to 87: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The EcoR I restriction site is underlined, while the complementary sfiA sequence is in italics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> PCR amplification on <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>HB101 chromosomal DNA resulted in a blunt PCR fragment of 352 bp. This fragment was cloned in the unique EcoR I site of pMOL877. Plasmid pMOL877 is based on the IncQ plasmid RSF1010 and contains in addition to a tetracycline resistance marker a promoterless luxCDABE operon. Upstream of this operon a unique EcoRI site is located. After EcoR I digestion the sticky ends of the EcoR I site were made blunt using Klenow DNA polymerase. After ligation the mixture was transformed to electrocompetent cells of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>ED8739 (Murray et al. 1977). Transformants were selected for growth on tetracycline, toothpicked in duplo onto rich medium containing tetracycline, and subsequently one plate was irradiated with U.V. Positive clones that showed U.V. inducible light production were visualised using autoradiography. The plasmid content of 4 positive clones was analyzed (restriction analysis and PCR) and all were shown to contain the same recombinant plasmid. This pMOL877 based derivative that contains the luxCDABE genes under transcription control of the sfiA promoter was designated pMOL890. The restriction maps of pMOL877 and pMOL890 are presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As a suitable alternative for the sfiA promoter, other promoter sequences that are under control of LexA and are activated during the SOS response can be cloned upstream of the lux reporter system. This could result in new constructs that show genotoxicity as a function of light production. In particular SOS-promoters with an induction ratio higher than 40 were considered to be of interest. SOS-promoters not involved in SOS mutagenesis but those involved in part of the RecF recombinations repair pathway were considered of interest. This group comprises recF. recJ, recN, recO, recQ, ruv and uvrD (formerly recL). The SOS mutagenesis promoters RecA and umu were not considered of interest in view of their low induction ratios of 11 and 28. After a literature study, the following candidate promoter sequences were selected for further study: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The recN promoter of <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli; </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The ruv promoter of <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli; </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The muc promoter of the <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>plasmid pHM101. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> From these candidates the recN promoter was chosen for further experimental work because RecN is the major constituent of the cell after induction of the SOS response and is known for its tight regulation by LexA (Finch et al. 1985; Picksly et al. 1985). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The recN promoter of <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli: </italic></highlight>construction of recN-lux fusions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The recN promoter has three LexA binding sites, one that overlaps with the -35 region and another that overlaps with the -10 region and the transcription start point of this promoter. The third LexA binding site is postulated to be located within the coding region. In this it differs from the sfiA promoter that has only one LexA binding site. The recN promoter has the following sequence (sequence id. no. 3, Rostas, et al. (1987)). in which the positions of the -35 and -10 regions (italics) as well as the positions of the two LexA binding sites (underlined) are indicated:

<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The promoter has similarity with the consensus promoter sequence (sequence id. no. 4) &ldquo;TTGACA-16/17bp-TATAAT&rdquo;, but the important G of the -35 region is replaced by a T. Therefore, the expression of the recN promoter under induced conditions might be rather weak as compared to the sfiA promoter that has the sequence TTGATC for its -35 region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Based on this information the following cloning experiments were carried out: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Cloning the wild type recN promoter by PCR amplification. Two primers, primer 1 sequence id. no. 5 upstream and primer 2 sequence id. no. 6 downstream of the promoter region, were synthesised that both introduce an EcoRI restriction site. Primer 1 is located at position 28-49 of the recN sequence. Primer 2 is located at position 550-526 of the recN sequence (complementary). GAATTC in the primers indicates an EcoRI site. The recN sequence is disclosed by Rostas et al. (1987). These restriction sites are required to clone the promoter fragment in the pMOL877 lux reporter vector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Eliminating the LexA2 binding site from the promoter sequence. For this purpose a primer 3 was chosen with the sequence id. no. 7 AAAGAACTTCTTATTGTGTACAGTAAACTGG, that modifies the sequence at the last three base pairs of the LexA2 binding site. These three base pairs form a consensus and are conserved in all Lex binding sites from <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>Salmonella typhimurium. </italic></highlight>The base pairs in italics at the 5&prime; end of primer 3 don&apos;t fit the wild type DNA sequence and were chosen to introduce an EcoRI restriction site. This primer must be used in combination with primer 1 for PCR amplification of the recN promoter. Primer 3 is complementary to the recN sequence at positions 360-338 (Rostas et al. 1987) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Introducing a &ldquo;promoter up&rdquo; mutation using primer 4 with sequence id. no. 8 (position 294-331 on recN according to Rostas et al. 1987) AAAAGAATTCTAATTTTACGCCAGCCTCTTGACTGTAT. This primer introduces a G (bold) at the consensus position of the -35 region, and also introduces an EcoRI restriction site at the 5&prime; end of the promoter region. To do so, the base pairs in italics at the 5&prime; end of primer 4 don&apos;t fit the wild type DNA sequence. This primer must be used in combination with primer 2 for PCR amplification of the recN promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Eliminating the LexA2 binding site from the promoter sequence and introducing a &ldquo;promoter up&rdquo; mutation. This can be done using the combination of primers 3 and 4 for PCR amplification of the recN promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The promoter region of the recN gene was amplified using the sets of primers described above. The extra mutations were also introduced. This resulted in the following PCR fragments: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> These PCR fragments were all digested with EcoRI and cloned in EcoRI linearized pMOL877, a lux CDABE expression vector.

<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> To examine the inducibility of the different promoter constructs by the bacterial SOS system, induction experiments were performed using 64 ppm of MMS, this according to the protocol provided furtheron. As control, non-induced cells were taken. The results as signal/noise ratio are presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> From the results it can be concluded that: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> pMOL890 (sfiA), containing the wild type sfiA promoter, is very well induced and expressed after SOS induction (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). In addition, the induction profile is very similar to the one observed with the recN-lux fusions pMOL1066 (recN1-2) and pMOL1067 (recN1-3) (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> pMOL1066 (recN1-2), containing the wild type recN promoter, is less well expressed after SOS induction than its derivatives (also regarding total light production) (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). The induction profile is very similar to the one observed with the sfiA-lux fusions pMOL890 and pMOL1067 (recN1-3) (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> recN1-3. containing the recN promoter lacking the LexA2 site, is very well induced and expressed after SOS induction. In addition, the induction profile is very similar to the one observed with the sfiA-lux fusion (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> recN2-4. containing the recN promoter with promoter up mutation, is very well induced and expressed after SOS induction. The total light production with this construct as well as the initial induction kinetics are even faster that those observed with pMOL890 and pMOL1067 (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). However, the induction pattern as illustrated by signal noise/ratio exhibits more fluctuation than for pMOL890 and pMOL1067 (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Therefore this construct could be a very good candidate to detect the presence of genotoxic compounds, but appears possibly less suitable to detect the presence of individual genotoxic compounds in mixtures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> recN3-4, containing the recN promoter with promoter up mutation lacking the LexA2 site, has a very strong light production but a poor signal noise ratio. Therefore, this construct is not suitable as a genotoxicity biosensor (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> In another series of experiments, the dose effect curves for <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>1106 containing pMOL1066, pMOL1067, pMOL1068 or pMOL1069 were determined for MMS (concentrations from 0.5 to 128 ppm) and U.V. irradiation (irradiation time of 2 to 10 seconds). The results of these experiments are presented in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> In both experiments, the best results were obtained with pMOL1068 (recN2-4). while pMOL1069 (recN3-4) gave the lowest signal/noise ratio&apos;s. With the sfiA-lux fusion in pMOL890 similar results were obtained. Based on the results it was decided to introduce the four recN promoter-lux fusion constructs (pMOL1066-pMOL1069) as well as the sfiA-lux fusion (pMOL890) in <highlight><italic>Salmonella typhimurium </italic></highlight>Ames test strains TA98, TA100, TA104, TA1535 and TA1538 and to test their induction as a function of the SOS response induced by the presence of genotoxic products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Introduction of the promoter-lux fusion constructs in <highlight><italic>S. typhimurium </italic></highlight>and testing </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> All five plasmids, pMOL890 and pMOL1066 to pMOL1069, were introduced in the Ames test <highlight><italic>S. typhimurium </italic></highlight>strains TA98, TA100, TA104, TA1535 and TA1538. This illustrates the feasability in general of transformation of Ames test strains in general. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Mutagenicity testing in <highlight><italic>S. typhimurium </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In order to examen whether the introduction of pMOL890, pMOL1066, pMOL1067, pMOL1068 or pMOL1069 had any effect on the characteristics of the <highlight><italic>S. typhimurium </italic></highlight>strains for mutagenicity testing (determined as the reversion frequency from His&minus; to His&plus; phenotype in the presence and absence of a mutagenic product), standard Ames tests were performed with both the original Ames test strains and their derivatives containing the above mentioned plasmids. For this testing the protocol described by Maron and Ames (1983) was followed. Testing was performed on MMS, 4-NQO, furazolidone, 2-AF and benzo-&agr;-pyrene. The results are presented in the tables 1A to 1G. Not all results obtained with the original Ames tests are presented, but from the tables and the comparison between tables 1A and 1B, and 1C and 1D, it can be concluded that the introduction of the plasmids did not change the His-reversion characteristics of the recombinant strains. Consequently, the recombinant strains can be used to perform the classical Ames test.

<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Luminescence testing in <highlight><italic>S. typhimurium </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> To examine the inducibility of the different <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>promoter constructs by the bacterial SOS system of <highlight><italic>S. typhimurium, </italic></highlight>induction experiments were performed using 64 ppm of MMS or 25.6 ppb 4-NQO, this according to the protocol disclosed furtheron. As control, non-induced cells were taken. The results as signal/noise ratio obtained for the recN-lux fusions pMOL1067 and pMOL1068 are presented in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> From these figures (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) it can be concluded that the induction kinetics with pMOL1068 RecN2-4) are slightly faster than those observed for pMOL1067 (RecN1-3). but that the maximum signal/noise ratio&apos;s are higher with pMOL1067 (RecN1-3) than with pMOL1068 (RecN2-4). Therefore both constructs are of interest and complementary for genotoxicity testing. With pMOL890 (sfiA) results were found similar to those observed with pMOL1067. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> The minimal detectable concentrations (MDC, in nmol/assay) were determined for 13 products. This with <highlight><italic>S. typhimurium </italic></highlight>Ames test strains containing pMOL890, pMOL1066, pMOL1067, pMOL1068 or pMOL1069. The results with <highlight><italic>S. typhimurium </italic></highlight>TA104 containing pMOL890, pMOL1066, pMOL1067, pMOL1068 or pMOL1069, and <highlight><italic>S. typhimurium </italic></highlight>TA98 containing pMOL890, pMOL1067 or pMOL1068 are presented in table 2. In addition literature MDC values found with the SOS chromotest and the Ames test are also presented. For certain products it was impossible to calculate the Ames test MDC values. For these products a positive (pos) or negative (neg) response is indicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Two products, casaminoacids and CdCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, were chosen as negative controls. It was impossible to test the casaminoacids with the Ames test, since this product contains histidine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> From table 2 it can be concluded that the best results were obtained with the strains containing pMOL890, pMOL1067 or pMOL1068. The results obtained with all constructs were always better than those found with the SOS-chromotest, this with the exception of ICR191 that gave similar results. The results were also much better than those found with the Ames test. This with the exception of 2,4,5,7-tetranitro-9-fluorenone. Therefore it can be concluded that the use of the sfiA and recN-lux gene fusions (pMOL890, pMOL1066, pMOL1067, pMOL1068 or pMOL1069) in the <highlight><italic>S. typhimurium </italic></highlight>Ames test strains provides a much faster and more sensitive way for detecting genotoxicity that the SOS chromotest and the Ames test.

<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Table 3 presents the results of genotoxicity tests performed with the TA 98 and TA104 strains containing pMOL1067 or pMOL1068. since the results found with these strains were similar, only the final outcome of the tests is presented (positive or negative). Similar results are given for the SOS chromotest (SOS) and the Ames test. The agents tested were generally accepted representative agents from the following categories: drugs, antimicrobial agents, pesticides, herbicides, inorganic compounds, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, laboratory chemicals, solvents, fuel and electromagnetic rays. From this table it can be concluded that the hybrid TA Ames test strains can be used to detect genotoxicity for all categories of products tested, and that only a few differences are observed with the results found for the SOS chromotest and the Ames test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> When comparing the results obtained with the TA98 and TA104 strains containing pMOL890, pMOL1067 or pMOL1068, with the results obtained with the SOS chromotest it can be concluded that: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> When a product is negative in the test with the TA98 and TA104 strains containing pMOL890, pMOL1067 or pMOL1068, it is also negative with the SOS chromotest. However, novobiocine and sodiumazide which are potentially genotoxic were negative in the SOS chromotest but positive in the test with the TA98 and TA104 strains containing pMOL890, pMOL1067 or pMOL1068. Therefore one can conclude that the test with the TA98 and TA104 strains containing pMOL890, pMOL1067 or pMOL1068 is more accurate for genotoxicity testing than the SOS chromotest, since no false-negatives were obtained. When a product is negative in the test with the TA98 and TA104 strains containing pMOL890, pMOL1067 or pMOL1068, it is also negative with the Ames test. The only exceptions were cyclophosphamide and ethylenethiourea that were negative in the test with the TA98 and TA104 strains containing pMOL890, pMOL1067 or pMOL1068. This is however not surprising, since these products do not induce the bacterial SOS response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> False-negative genotoxic products in the Ames test, like mitomycin C, naladixic acid, hydrogen-peroxide, pyrene and phenanthrene, were found to be positive in the test with the TA98 and TA104 strains containing pMOL890, pMOL1067 or pMOL1068. Therefore one can conclude that the test with the TA98 and TA104 strains containing pMOL890, pMOL1067 or pMOL1068 is not merely as good as the Ames test, but is in addition more accurate for the testing of environmental contaminants like PAH&apos;s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Testing of combinations of genotoxic products </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The reaction of the different constructs when more than one genotoxic product is present in the test sample, was examined. This is an important aspect, since environmental samples often contain more than one genotoxic pollutant. Also in this regard many pharmaceutical products that have to be tested for genotoxicity can be a combination of different active genotoxic substances (e.g. anticancer or anti AIDS drugs). The experiments were performed with TA98 and TA104 containing either pMOL1067 or pMOL890. These two constructs were chosen since they show similar induction kinetics and the best signal/noise ratio&apos;s in <highlight><italic>S. typhimurium </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). As test products, several combinations of MMS and novobiocine were taken. These products were used since they were found by us to have different induction kinetics (e.g., with pMOL1067 MMS gives a maximum after 2 hours, while the maximal signal/noise ratio with novobiocine is observed after 4 hours). Examples of the results of these experiments are presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> From these results it can be concluded that with both strains containing pMOL890 (sfiA-lux) or pMOL1067 (recN1,3-lux) the presence of at least two individual genotoxic compounds can be determined in a mixture of genotoxic compounds. This was completely contrary to expectations, because an increase of the maximum signal instead of two individual maxima was to be expected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> It was also examined if the data obtained in the previous experiment with combinations of MMS and novobiocine would result in a genotoxicity ranking for the different combinations used, and if the ranking would be the same with the different test strains &lsqb;e.g. with TA98 (pMOL1067) and TA104 (pMOL890)&rsqb;. To test this, the total signal/noise ratio was calculated for each of the combinations tested, and subsequently they were ranked from low to high. This resulted in a logical and identical ranking for the different test strains. An example is shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Toxicity testing </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The different constructs produce a background light signal in the absence of a genotoxic product. This is called the noise. This noise signal can be used as a measure for the presence of a toxic instead of a genotoxic compound. Especially the strains containing pMOL890 and pMOL1068 that show a relatively high noise are considered very suitable for this toxicity testing (their noise will go up in the course of a 4 hour experiment from 100 to 13000 relative light units), while strains containing pMOL1066 or pMOL1067 that have a low noise are of less use (their noise will go up in the course of a 4 hour experiment from 20 to 750 relative light units). This is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference>, where the decrease in light production was observed for TA98 containing pMOL1067 or pMOL1068 when challenged with different concentrations of the toxic product R116. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> By comparing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</cross-reference> it is evident that the signal/noise ratio&apos;s found with TA98 (pMOL1068) are much more constant than those found for TA98 (pMOL1067). As a consequence of the much higher basic light production for strain TA98 (pMOL1068) the importance of errors in the measurement of the light production is less, resulting in less fluctuation in the calculated signal/noise data. Strain TA98 (pMOL1068) but also other strains containing pMOL890 or pMOL1068 are very useful for the IC50 calculation value of toxic products. Preferred strains will exhibit at least the same basic light production as strain TA 98 (pMOL1068) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Testing of environmental samples </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Since testing on pure products showed that strains containing pMOL890, pMOL1067 or pMOL1068 were more sensitive for the testing of potential environmental contaminants (like PAH&apos;s) than the classical Ames test, these strains were used for the testing of environmental samples. Examples presented are: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> evaluation of the bioremediation of soil polluted with PAH&apos;s </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> appearance of water soluble PAH degradation products </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Soil samples were polluted with 500 ppm mixture (Borneff mixture containing naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene and benzo-&agr;-pyrene). Subsequently the soil was treated in a bioreactor to stimulate the bacterial degradation of the PAH&apos;s. To evaluate the bioremediation of the soil and to examine the decrease in genotoxicity. 10 g soil samples were taken during a period of 3 weeks. These samples were extracted with hexane (1 ml/g soil) and the extracts were concentrated 100&times;. The concentrated extracts were diluted 1 to 8 times and used for genotoxicity testing (with and without metabolic activation). For each sample a genotoxicity value was calculated as the product of (signal/noise ratio higher than 2 at the highest positive dilution)&times;(dilution factor). For instance, if at dilution 4&times; a S/N ratio of 2.8 was found, this sample received 11.2 as genotoxicity value. The genotoxicity values were plotted and this gave a nice overview and evaluation of the genotoxicity of the polluted soil. Data of such an experiment are presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> it can be concluded that in time there is a decrease of the genotoxicity of the soil polluted with PAH&apos;s. This demonstrates that the strains containing pMOL890, pMOL1067 or pMOL1068 are very useful for the follow up and evaluation of the remediation of soil polluted with genotoxic products. In general strains comprising a sequence with an SOS regulated promoter with an induction ratio higher than 40, said promoter being operatively linked to a reporter encoding nucleic acid sequence encoding a reporter resulting in a signal that can be assayed as light production can be used in a preferred embodiment. Any of the claimed host microorganisms can be suitably used in such a test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> To analyze the formation of water soluble intermediate PAH degradation products, the degradation of phenanthrene, fluorene and fluoranthene was examined. To do so, minimal M9 medium without extra carbon source was saturated with 0.1% of the PAH and inoculated with a strain capable of degrading the PAH. Every 3 days samples (200 ml) were taken and concentrated according to the procedure of Grifoll et al (1994). The extraction occurred at pH 2.5 or pH 7 and the samples were concentrated to 5 ml. 1 ml of each sample was dried out at 37&deg; C. and resuspended in 100 &mgr;l DMSO. 1 &mgr;l of this was used for genotoxicity testing. For phenanthrene an increase followed by a decrease in genotoxicity was observed, for fluorene no significant increase in genotoxicity was observed, but for fluoranthene an increase of genotoxicity was observed. This indicated the formation and accumulation of a genotoxic intermediate compound. The result of the evaluation of fluoranthene degradation by strain LB208 is presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. Only the data for the extractions performed at pH 2.5 are presented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> From this experiment it can be concluded that strains containing pMOL890, pMOL1067 or pMOL1068 are useful for the evaluation of the degradation of genotoxic pollutants and for the appearance and accumulation of genotoxic intermediate degradation products. In general strains comprising a sequence with an SOS regulated promoter with an induction ratio higher than 20, preferably higher than 40, most preferably higher than 50, said promoter being operatively linked to a reporter encoding nucleic acid sequence encoding a reporter resulting in a signal that can be assayed as light production can be used in a preferred embodiment. Any of the claimed host microorganisms can be suitably used in such a test. Toxicity testing was also possible on environmental samples as was demonstrated on DMSO extracts of gazoline polluted soil. Higher concentrations of the extract resulted in increased toxicity (data not shown). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> 1. INTRODUCTION </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The test is based on bacteria that contain the lux operon of <highlight><italic>Vibrio fischeri </italic></highlight>under transcriptional control of the recN gene, that is part of the SOS-system. After incubation of the cells with a genotoxic product, the recN promoter will become derepressed, resulting in expression of the lux operon. The expression results in light production in function of the genotoxicity. However, the same protocol can also be used for the test performed with the sfiA-Lux strans. For other SOS regulated promoter comprising systems according to the invention a person skilled in the art will also be able to use this protocol. </paragraph>
