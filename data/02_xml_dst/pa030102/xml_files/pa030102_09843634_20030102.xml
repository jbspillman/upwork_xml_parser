<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to downhole instruments used to transmit an indication of the occurrence of event(s). More particularly, the invention relates to fluid pressure modulation telemetry systems used with such instruments to transmit the indications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Drilling and completion systems known in the art include so called measurement-while-drilling (MWD) systems. MWD systems include one or more sensors disposed in an instrument lowered into the wellbore, typically during the drilling, completion, or treatment thereof, which detect a physical parameter related to a condition in the wellbore or to a property of the formations surrounding the wellbore. MWD systems also include electronic circuitry which converts the measurements made by the one or more sensors into a representative signal which is applied to some form of fluid pressure modulation telemetry. Pressure modulation telemetry uses a device to alter the flow of drilling or treatment fluid through the instrument in a predetermined manner to communicate the representative signal to the earth&apos;s surface. The signal is detected typically by one or more pressure sensors disposed at the earth&apos;s surface in the fluid circulation system. A detection, interpretation and recording system coupled to the pressure sensor decodes the representative signal to extract the measurement made by the one or more sensors. Typical MWD systems are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,958,217; 3,964,556; 3,736,558; 4,078,620; and 5,073,877. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A problem common to all prior art MWD pressure modulation telemetry systems is pressure noise in the fluid circulation system. Such noise can be caused by, among other things, pulsations in the output of the fluid circulation pump, and vibrations and shocks caused by the movement of the drilling equipment (and consequently the instrument itself). Pressure noise can make detection of the MWD telemetry signal difficult, particularly at high data rates. It is common in MWD telemetry to represent the value of the representative signal as a binary coded decimal &ldquo;word&rdquo; including a number of digital bits related to the measurement range for the particular one of the sensors represented in the telemetry signal. As is known in the art, various modulation techniques are applied to the fluid pressure to represent digital &ldquo;ones&rdquo; and &ldquo;zeroes&rdquo; in the telemetry. Typical modulation techniques include momentary pressure increases (positive pulse telemetry), momentary pressure decreases (negative pulse telemetry) and phase shift keying of a standing wave (mud siren). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Detection of the proper sequence of binary coded information to recover the representative signal is difficult in noisy conditions, and may require expensive and difficult to operate equipment at the earth&apos;s surface. Further, the typical telemetry generator used in MWD systems is expensive to make and to operate. Finally, detection of certain types of downhole conditions can be represented by more simple telemetry signals than are provided in the typical MWD telemetry system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One solution to the limitations of conventional MWD telemetry for use in transmitting simple indications of a downhole condition is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,626,192 issued to Connell et al. The device described in this patent is a casing collar locator which is adapted to be operated at the end of a string of coiled tubing. A casing collar detector in the instrument conducts electrical signals to a controller in the instrument, which upon receipt of a collar detection signal, operates a valve consisting of a set of lateral ports. The ports, when opened, conduct some of the fluid flowing through the instrument to the annular space between the outside of the coiled tubing and the wellbore wall. While the instrument in the Connell et al &apos;192 patent has proven effective, there are circumstances where diverting fluid flow from the interior of the tubing/instrument to the annular space outside them is undesirable. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, setting a plug or pumping acid or scale removal chemicals through the coiled tubing and the instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> What is needed is a fluid pressure telemetry system which provides robust, easy to detect signals at the earth&apos;s surface, and maintains fluid flow within the instrument. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the invention is a system for communication from an instrument disposed in a wellbore. The system includes a flow diverter selectively operable to conduct fluid flow through a first path along the interior of a housing and a second path along the interior of the housing. The system includes an initiator operatively coupled to the flow diverter to cause selective operation thereof in response to a first event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The first event can comprise any of a number of occurrences, including but not limited to, the detection of certain downhole components, the sensing of certain wellbore conditions, the sensing of certain tool string or tool component conditions, the sensing of certain formation characteristics, the expiration of a period of time, the execution of a software program or subroutine, or the reception or transmission of a signal from or to components at the surface or in the wellbore. Depending on the nature of the first event, the initiator may also include at lease one detector, software program, analyzer, timer, or sensor (to name a few) in order to sense the occurrence of the first event. Generally, when the initiator senses the first event, the flow diverter diverts at least some of the fluid flow to the second flow path, which creates a pressure change that can be sensed and that serves as an indication of the occurrence of the event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the flow diverter is a piston operated by an actuator. One embodiment of the actuator is a ball screw operated by an electric motor. One embodiment of the initiator is operatively attached to a casing collar locator wherein the first event comprises the detection of a casing collar by the locator. Upon detection of a casing collar in the wellbore, the piston is moved from a first position to a second position, to divert flow from the first path to the second path, for a selected amount time, to indicate detection of the casing collar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A method for communicating from an instrument disposed in a wellbore according to another aspect of the invention includes conducting fluid flow through a first path having a first flow restriction. The first flow path is located along the interior of the instrument. Upon the occurrence of a first event, the fluid flow is diverted along a second path having a second flow restriction in response to the first event. The second path is located along the interior of the instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Other aspects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description and the appended claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of a signaling apparatus according to the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in cutaway view. The apparatus, shown generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is disposed inside a substantially cylindrical housing adapted to be coupled to the end of a drill pipe, production tubing, coiled tubing or the like. In this embodiment, for convenience of assembly and maintenance, the housing may be formed from individual sections <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A that are coupled to each other by connectors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the sections <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A each include therein a particular module forming part of the complete apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, one of the modules in this embodiment includes a signaler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a processor/controller <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The processor/controller <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be of any type known in the art for receiving signals from an initiator and operating a telemetry transmitter in a manner corresponding to the signals received from the initiator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A second one of the modules can include an electric power source <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which in this embodiment comprises at least one battery, such as a lithium battery. The actual type of electric power source used in any particular embodiment of the invention is a matter of choice for the designer and is not intended to limit the invention. As will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art, however, using batteries substantially reduces the complexity of the apparatus as compared with using turbines or other power sources operated by fluid flow through the apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A third module in this embodiment includes an initiator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The initiator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be operatively coupled to the processor/controller <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as will be further explained, to operate the signaler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a manner corresponding to the occurrence of selected events. The sections <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A also define therein a fluid channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The fluid channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is adapted to direct flow of fluids, such as drilling, completion or treatment fluids, along the interior of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as will be further explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the signaler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a selectively operable flow diverter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The flow diverter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is hydraulically interposed within the segment of the fluid channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that is formed within the signaler section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>A. In one embodiment, as will be explained in more detail, the flow diverter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> comprises a piston coupled to an actuator (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). As will be further explained, when the piston of flow diverter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is in a retracted position, fluid entering the upper end <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is free to flow along a first flow path (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) in the fluid channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the lower end <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Some of the fluid also flows along a second flow path (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) in the fluid channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, as will be further explained. When the piston of flow diverter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is extended by the actuator (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) at least some fluid flow is diverted to the second flow path (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), out through the lower end <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, substantially or entirely all of the fluid flow is diverted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The initiator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is adapted to sense the occurrence of event(s). The types of events that may be sensed by the initiator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are varied. Depending on the type of event, the initiator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may include at least one detector, software program, analyzer, timer, or sensor (to name a few), which function to enable the initiator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to sense the event. Generally and among others, the event can comprise the detection of certain downhole components, sensing certain wellbore conditions, sensing certain tool string or individual component conditions, sensing certain formation characteristics, the expiration of a period of time, the execution of a software program or subroutine, or the reception or transmission of a signal from or to components at the surface or in the wellbore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> More specifically and also among others, the event can comprise the detection of casing collars (with the inclusion of a casing collar locator), sensing a certain wellbore or tool temperature (with the inclusion of temperature sensor), sensing a certain wellbore or tool pressure (with the inclusion of a pressure sensor), sensing a certain wellbore or tool orientation (with the inclusion of an orientation sensor), sensing a certain downhole chemical composition such as pH or capacitance (with the inclusion of a chemical composition sensor such as pH or capacitance meter), sensing a certain flow rate (with the inclusion of a flow rate sensor), sensing nuclear magnetic resonance from the tool string surroundings (with the inclusion of a nuclear magnetic resonance sensor), sensing gamma ray returns from the tool string surroundings (with the inclusion of a gamma ray detector), sensing a certain distance from a point located in the wellbore (with the inclusion of a proximity sensor), sensing the completion of a function by a tool or tool component (with the inclusion of a function completion sensor), sensing the failure of a tool or tool component (with the inclusion of a failure sensor), sensing the execution of a software program or subroutine (with the inclusion of an appropriate flag, for instance), receiving a signal such as data or a command from the surface or from another point in the wellbore (with the inclusion of an appropriate receiver), transmitting a signal such as data or a command to the surface or to another point in the wellbore (with the inclusion of an appropriate transmitter), or sensing a certain status in the tool or other tools and components (with the inclusion of an appropriate status sensor). These types of events (and their respective sensors, etc.) are meant only to serve as examples which may be used in embodiments of the invention and are not intended to limit the types of events which may be used with any particular embodiment of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> By way of example of the different types of events, in one embodiment, the initiator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be adapted to detect the presence of casing collars, in which case it would include a magnetic flux type casing collar locator. This type of collar locator is well known in the art and generally includes a permanent magnet (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) to magnetize steel casing in a wellbore (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and a detector coil (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) in which are induced voltages related to changes in the magnetic flux passing therethrough. The operation of the collar locator as it pertains to the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be further explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The signaler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown in more detail in the schematic diagrams in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which shows the previously mentioned piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the retracted position, fluid flow, shown generally at <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, enters the signaler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through an inlet end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (which forms part of the fluid channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) to the previously described first flow path <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A and second flow path <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The second flow path, shown at <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, includes therein an orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which has a selected internal diameter and is adapted to fit securely, in this embodiment, into the discharge side <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A of the second flow path <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The second flow path <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the first flow path <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A are joined at their discharge or downstream ends into the discharge or downstream side <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the signaler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (coupled hydraulically to fluid channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> by arrows, when the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is retracted, some of the fluid flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> passes through the first flow path <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, while other, smaller portions of the fluid flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may pass through the second flow path <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The first <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A and second <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> flow paths are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> as being located along the interior of the signaler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It should be clearly understood that the actual direction of fluid flow along either the first <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A or second path may be in any direction with respect to the length of the signaler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It is only necessary that the fluid flow ultimately enter the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at one end thereof and exit the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the other end. The first <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A and second <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> flow paths may thus take any configuration internal to the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which enables such fluid entry and exit from the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> while diverting the fluid flow as explained herein. Accordingly, the term &ldquo;along the interior&rdquo; as used to define the fluid paths <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is intended to include within its scope any such internal configuration of fluid flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the second flow path <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is positioned so that the orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is accessible from the discharge side <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of signaler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the second flow path <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is positioned so that the orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is accessible from the inlet side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of signaler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Having the orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> accessible from either the discharge side <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or the inlet side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> enables the quick and efficient removal of the orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For example, if the orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is accessible from the inlet side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, an operator simply needs to disassemble the portions of apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> above the signaler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (which portions are typically few and are easily disassembled) to remove the orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be included in the second flow path <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in any other manner which makes it possible to remove the orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the signaler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Therefore the position of the orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the configuration of the flow paths <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> are not meant to limit the scope of the invention. The significance of the removable orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will be further explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, as previously explained, in this embodiment is moved along a corresponding bore <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by an actuator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which may be a linear actuator. Typically the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will be sealed within the bore <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by a seal, such as shown at <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and is able to move axially along the bore <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The actuator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is a ball screw operated by an electric motor. Other embodiments may include such devices as a solenoid and ferromagnetic plunger combination. Using an electrically operated actuator has the advantage of simplifying the design of the actuator, thus avoiding complicated and expensive hydraulic systems typically associated with actuators used in prior art MWD systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is coupled on its rear face (the face opposite the one exposed to the incoming fluid flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) to a pressure compensation system <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The pressure compensation system includes a pressure compensator <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in hydraulic communication on one side to the upstream side <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and on its other side to a fluid reservoir <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in hydraulic communication with the back side (rear face) of the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The reservoir <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be filled with hydraulic oil or the like. The compensator <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in this embodiment is a piston which is free to move along a corresponding bore, but other types of compensator, such as a diaphragm, bellows or the like may be used in other embodiments of a pressure compensation system. The purpose of the pressure compensation system <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is to provide equal flowing fluid pressure, which is the fluid flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> pressure at the upstream side <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, to both sides (upstream side <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and rear face) of the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. By equalizing the pressure on both sides (upstream side <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and rear face) of the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the actuator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> need only provide enough force to the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to overcome seal friction, rather than having to additionally overcome differential pressure caused by the fluid flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through the signaler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This feature reduces the size and power requirements of the actuator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> as compared with unbalanced flow diverter systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, a safety valve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, which in this embodiment is a rupture disc, can be disposed in the pressure compensation system <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in hydraulic communication with the reservoir <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> on one side, and with the downstream side <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on its other side. Other embodiments may include a pressure relief valve as the safety valve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. The purpose of the safety valve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is to provide a mechanism to hydraulically move the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to its retracted position in the event differential pressure across the signaler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> exceeds a preselected value. The operation of the safety valve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> will be further explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is moved along the bore <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by the actuator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to its extended position, the first fluid flow path <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A is partially or substantially completely closed to the fluid flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. At least some of the fluid flow is thus diverted to the second flow path <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which includes therein the orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, substantially or entirely all of the fluid flow is diverted. Because at least some of the fluid flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is diverted through the orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which may have a smaller opening than the internal diameter of the first flow path <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, the fluid pressure on the inlet <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> side of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (upstream side <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) will increase. As previously explained, the orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be changed by access through the discharge side <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or the inlet side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the fluid flow path. The orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be held in place by threads, or any other mechanism adapted to make the orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> held securely in place during operation of the apparatus, yet be easily changeable by the system operator when needed. In this embodiment, the orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be selected to provide a detectably large, or any other selected amplitude, pressure increase in the fluid flow when the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is extended to partially or completely close the first fluid flow path <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A. As will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art, this particular feature of this embodiment of the invention makes it possible for the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be used with a wide range of expected fluid flow rates in different wellbores, without having to make the signaler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> specially adapted to a particular range of fluid flow rates. This may avoid the need, as in prior art signaling systems, to have available a plurality of different signalers each adapted to a particular flow rate range to make the apparatus useful over a number of flow rate ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the front face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A of the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is preferably shaped to efficiently divert any solid material which may be in the fluid flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the particular passage opened with respect to the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the front face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A is beveled to direct any solids in the fluid flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. An advantage offered by the beveled or similarly shaped front face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A is a reduction in the possibility of solids accumulating in the first and second fluid flow paths <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so as to block them. Also, the face <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A properly directs any deliberately introduced solid materials, such as &ldquo;process balls&rdquo;, which are launched through the coiled tubing, thereby minimizing the possibility of any such process balls or other solids being held by gravity or eddy currents in a comer out of the direct path of fluid flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The safety valve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, as previously explained, is provided to make possible retraction of the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by the fluid flow <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in certain circumstances. For example, if the orifice <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> were to become clogged with debris or the like, the pressure increase which would occur on extension of the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be excessive and dangerous. When the differential pressure across the safety valve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> exceeds the selected value, the valve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> will open, causing the pressure extant in the downstream side <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to be applied to the back side (rear face) of the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Higher fluid pressure on the upstream side <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will force the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to its retracted position, thereby opening the first fluid flow path <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>A. The safety valve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> also provides the ability to retract the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the event the actuator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> fails to operate. The system operator in such cases would only need to increase the rate of fluid flow until the differential pressure between the upstream side <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the downstream side <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> exceeds the selected opening pressure of the safety valve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in operation, the initiator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> produces a signal in response to the detection of sensing of a first event (which can be any of a number of occurrences, as previously discussed). In the embodiment including the controller/processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the signal is transferred to the controller/processor (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), whereupon the controller/processor (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) transmits an operating signal to the actuator (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). In the embodiment not including the controller/processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the signal is transferred to the actuator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In response to the signal (in either embodiment), the actuator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> then causes the flow diverter (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) to change position, as previously explained. A change in pressure of the fluid flowing through a coiled tubing <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to which the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is attached will be detected by a pressure sensor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> disposed at the earth&apos;s surface and in pressure communication with the high pressure side of a fluid circulation system (and therefore the interior of the coiled tubing <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>). The pressure measurements made by the sensor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can be coupled to a recording and interpretation system <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of any type known in the art for decoding pressure modulation telemetry. Although the pressure sensor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is shown disposed at the earth&apos;s surface, in other applications, the pressure sensor may be disposed at a selected depth in the wellbore <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In the exemplary embodiment, the initiator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a casing collar locator which produces a voltage when the locator is moved past a change in magnetic flux path through casing, such as would be found at casing collars <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> in the wellbore <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. Thus, in the exemplary embodiment, the first event is the detection of casing collar. Each time a casing collar is detected by the initiator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, the initiator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> sends a signal to the controller/processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or directly to the actuator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, depending on the embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Although the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is conveyed into the wellbore <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at the end of coiled tubing <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, it should be clearly understood that other means of conveying the apparatus into the wellbore could be used with the invention, such as drill pipe or production tubing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Various types of signal telemetry which are possible using the apparatus of the invention are shown in graphic form in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a graph of pressure measured by the sensor (<highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) with respect to time. In this embodiment, a voltage pulse which is generated by the initiator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is received by the processor/controller <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which operates the actuator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to move the piston to the extended position at time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A corresponding pressure increase, from P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> occurs at T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. After a preselected time interval, which in this embodiment is shown from T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the processor/controller <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> operates the actuator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to retract the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, resulting in a reduction in pressure from P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The length of time between detection of an event which causes the piston to extend and its later retraction, can be programmed into the processor/controller <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to represent detection of different events, or have any other predetermined meaning or significance. In one example, detection of a casing collar may be represented by a shorter duration pressure increase from T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, while detection of float equipment may result in a longer time pressure increase, such as from T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As another example, detection of different types of events by different sensors (not shown in the Figures, but examples of which were provided earlier herein) may result in pressure changes having individually identifiable durations. An example of a different type of event could be having one of the aforementioned temperature sensors in the apparatus, where a temperature event, such as a temperature change exceeding a predetermined threshold would be signaled by producing a pressure increase having a selected time duration corresponding to the &ldquo;temperature event&rdquo;. Other examples of events could include detection of gamma radiation above a threshold level, such as would occur when a gamma ray detector used as the initiator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> passed near a radioactive marker. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the various types of sensors previously described herein, as well as other types of sensors, each may be used to detect a condition which may be characterized in terms of an &ldquo;event&rdquo;. Each such event detected may result in the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> sending a specific coded pressure signal according to the various telemetry schemes explained herein. In one embodiment, each coded pressure signal is event specific. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The actuator (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) in this embodiment of the invention (motor operated ball screw) may also move the piston (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) to positions intermediate of the fully extended and fully retracted positions. This makes possible another type of telemetry in which more than one magnitude of pressure change may be applied to the fluid flow to indicate different types of detected events. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, one such event, shown as an increase in pressure from P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, takes place at T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The pressure increase from P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be performed, for example, by moving the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> halfway from its retracted position to the extended position. At T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the pressure is increased from P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, at time T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, by extending the piston <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> the rest of the way to the full extended position. As in the previous example of telemetry format, the duration of each pressure change can be programmed to correspond to any selected event detected by the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Still further, a pressure change from P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> back to P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, shown at T<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, may be generated by fully retracting the piston in a single operation. The inverse operation, generating a pressure change from P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by fully extending the piston, is shown at T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Pressure decreases, by retracting the piston halfway are shown from P<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> at T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and from P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at T<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment of the invention, the programmer/controller (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) may be programmed to operate the actuator (<highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) to move the piston (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) an intermediate distance between the fully extended and fully retracted positions so as to produce an intermediate pressure change similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> to represent different types of detected events. In addition, the duration of the pressure changes can be selected to represent different types of detected events. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The invention provides an apparatus which can communicate the occurrence of an event by modifying the pressure of a fluid flowing through the apparatus. The apparatus can be used in cases where it is not desirable to selectively divert fluid inside a coiled tubing, drill pipe or tubing to an annular space outside the tubing in the wellbore. Further, the invention in some embodiments provides a signaler which is relatively immune to blockage by solid material in the flowing fluid. Other embodiments of the invention have a selectable orifice so that the apparatus can be adjusted to work in a variety of fluid flow rate ranges without the need to have signalers sized to correspond to the expected flow rate range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art will appreciate that other embodiments can be devised which do not depart from the scope of the invention as disclosed herein. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be limited only by the attached claims. </paragraph>
