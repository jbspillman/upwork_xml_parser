<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to all wheel drive vehicles, and more particularly, relates to an all wheel drive vehicle with a reduction gear for a low range integrated within one of the axle differentials. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> All wheel drive systems have been known for years in the motor vehicle industry. A typical type of all wheel drive vehicle is a full time auto engaging system wherein a fixed torque split of e.g., 50/50 between the front and rear axles is used. However, other torque splits such as 60/40, 70/30 or even 20/80 may be used. Most current all wheel drive systems have a center differential which provides the torque to the rear differential and front differentials, respectively. The center differential on prior art all wheel drive vehicles can be combined with a low range gear for use in off road driving and severe driving conditions. The low range gear in the transfer case of prior art devices provides extremely high torque to the wheels for heavy duty towing and hazardous driving conditions. Some of the all wheel drive prior art vehicles have also provided the low range gear as a shiftable planetary reduction gear that is integrated in the transfer case of the drive line system. The use of the planetary gear arrangement in the center differential generally requires an extended transfer case which creates a need for all wheel drive vehicles to have longer power trains that lead to increases of the noise, vibration and harshness of the vehicle along with packaging issues associated with such low range options. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The prior art all wheel drive systems that include low range gears also have to design all of the drive line components after the reduction gear to be sized for maximum load which leads to a high torque, high weight drive line, thus the need for specifically designed prop shafts, axles and side shafts for the drive line system. The prior art all wheel drive vehicles also have drive trains that may have transversal engine arrangements which restricts the amount of packaging for the transfer case which in some instances does not even allow for the integration of the low range option because of packaging restrictions with the engine arranged in such a manner. Furthermore, these prior art all wheel drive systems use the torque split between the front and rear axles for both on and off road usage, i.e., whether in the high gear or the low range gear, which is not conducive to optimum all wheel drive conditions in the low range option. The all wheel drive systems also tend to need forced lubrication for the low range permanent idling reduction gears which usually includes an oil pump which will increase the cost, complexity and losses in the transfer case of the all wheel drive system. The prior art all wheel drive systems can either be completely mechanical wherein the secondary driven axle is a hang on axle that is engaged when the primary driven axles slips and such slip is sent through a viscous coupling or other differential setup that engages the rear differential thus sending torque to the wheels that have the better grip in the road conditions. However, with the complexity of all wheel drive vehicles increasing there are also systems that electronically sense the slip on the individual wheels of the front axle and the rear axle and electronically engage the brakes on the slipping wheels to send power to the other wheels within the predetermined torque split. Many of these brake and traction controlled full time all wheel drive systems are left without the option of a low range because of the packaging issues and transversal engine arrangement found in a lot of the smaller SUV&apos;s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need in the art for an all wheel drive system that includes a center differential and has a low range gear integrated in one of the drive axles. This will allow for a full time all wheel drive system to include a low range option in all vehicle configurations including transversal engines, etc. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, a full time all wheel drive system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for a full time all wheel drive vehicle according to the present invention is shown. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> schematically illustrate an all wheel drive or four wheel drive motor vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that has a transversal engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or a longitudinal engine <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment of the invention the front axle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is driven with 60% of the torque provided while the rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has only 40% of the basic torque provided therein. However, it should be noted that the present invention can be used with various torque splits between front and rear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a motor vehicle that has 60% of its torque power provided to the front axle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> while 40% of the torque power is provided to the rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in its basic configuration. This all wheel drive vehicle or four wheel drive vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is driven by power transferred from the engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to a transaxle or gear box <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which may be either an automatic or a manual gear box, into the power takeoff <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the drive train assembly and into a center differential <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> located in the power takeoff unit transmission. The center differential <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will then distribute the torque to both the front differential <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the rear differential <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via a propeller shaft or driving shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The basic torque split for an all wheel drive vehicle may be 60/40 with 60% of the torque going to the front axle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and 40% going to the rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the center differential <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the rear differential <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, front differential <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and center differential <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are generally always open differentials within an all wheel drive system. At the front differential <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> the power is split to the left hand front side shaft <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a right hand front side shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for distribution to the wheels <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> at the front of the vehicle. The rear differential <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> receives power from the center differential <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> via the propeller shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and equally distributes the torque to the left hand rear side shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the right hand rear side shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment the present invention is an all wheel drive wherein the torque distribution has 60% of the basic torque delivered to the dominate front differential <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> while 40% is delivered to the rear differential <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> when the vehicle is in the high gear of the all wheel drive system. When slip is encountered on either the front wheels <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> or the rear wheels <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>A of the present all wheel drive system the brake on the slipping wheels is engaged to maintain the torque transfer to the non-slipping axle in accordance to the basic torque split. Therefore, if the front wheels begin to spin on ice, snow or other slick road conditions the front brakes will be engaged and, the center differential <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will transfer the remaining torque to the rear differential <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in accordance with the basic torque split. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the drive line layout for a transversal engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which is found in many modern day smaller off road vehicles. The transversal engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> provides the engine sideways under the hood of the vehicle and provides special needs for packaging of the transfer case and other drive line components. The center differential <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is located directly adjacent to the transversal engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the power take off or in the transmission. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a drive line layout having a longitudinal engine <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The same components are used in the longitudinal engine <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as these found in the transversal engine <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and they include the center differential <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which is connected via a prop shaft or drive shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to both the rear differential <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the front differential <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the vehicle. In the case of the longitudinally placed engine <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the center differential <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is located adjacent to the transmission and more toward the center point of the vehicle&apos;s body. The rear differential <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the transversal and longitudinal engines <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> include a low range gear or reduction gear integrated within the rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The front axle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> uses commonly known parts and differential known throughout the industry and will not be specifically described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a cross section of a rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. The rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> generally includes an axle housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which is supported on the frame of the vehicle. The axle housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes a pinion gear or driving gear and pinion shaft <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which is directly connected to a prop shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The prop shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is also connected on the opposite end thereof to the center differential <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and provides torque to the rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The pinion shaft <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is supported by a first and second set of bearings (<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>). A differential <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is rotatably supported, via bearings <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, within the rear axle housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The differential <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has a ring gear <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> on an outside surface thereof. The ring gear <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> meshes with the pinion gear <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to provide the necessary torque to propel the rear wheels <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A left hand side <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and right hand side stub shaft <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> extend from the differential <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and connect to the respective right hand rear side shaft <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and left hand rear side shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The differential <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> generally includes a differential housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and within that differential housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is the integrated reduction gear <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> according to the present invention. The rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> also includes within its housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> a shift mechanism <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which will engage a low range gear or a high range gear for the all wheel drive system. It should be noted that if the all wheel drive vehicle is a primary rear driven vehicle, then the rear axle will be a standard well known axle and the front axle housing will include the shift mechanism integrated within the differential housing of the front axle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a partial cross section of the axle lay out for the rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the preferred embodiment of the invention. The axle housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> rotatably supports the pinion shaft <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and driving gear <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> connected to the end of the pinion shaft <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The pinion shaft <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is rotatably supported by a ball bearing <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in contact with the axle housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The driving gear <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> interacts and engages with the ring gear <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which is attached to the differential housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> by any known securing means. The differential housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is supported within the axle housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by a first set of bearings <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and a second set of bearings <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. A shift mechanism <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is connected to the axle housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and is controlled via mechanical links that are connected to an onboard system computer of the vehicle. The shift mechanism <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in the preferred embodiment is a dog clutch. The dog clutch <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> has a shift lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> that is connected to an arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that engages either a first tab <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to a second tab <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> or a second tab <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to a third tab <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The first tab <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is secured to the axle housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> while the third tab <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is secured to the differential housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The second tab <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is secured to a sun gear <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and shifts between contacting the first and third tabs <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The shift lever <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> moves the shift arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to one of three predefined positions. The first is where the first tab <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the second tab <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are secured to one another by the shift arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and effectively locks the axle housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the sun gear. The second position is when the shift arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> only contacts the second tab <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and in effect disconnects the rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the all wheel drive system. The third position is when the shift arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> connects the second tab <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to the third tab <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and connects the differential housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to the sun gear <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The stub shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, has the sun gear <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> surrounding it. The sun gear <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of teeth on both ends <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> thereof. The plurality of teeth <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are connected by a long body portion <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The sun gear <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> generally has a cylindrical shape. The differential housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has a differential bevel gear set <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> rotatably supported therein. The differential gear set <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> includes a first <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and second side gear <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> interacting and engaging with a first <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and second pinion gear (not shown). A differential pin <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is secured to the inside portion of the differential housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and also has the pinion gears <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> rotatably connected thereto. The side gears <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> of the differential <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are connected via a series of teeth <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the stub shafts <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which extend out to the left hand rear side shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the right hand rear side shaft <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Adjacent to the inner surface of differential housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is a hollow gear <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which includes an orifice on one end thereof which receives the differential pin <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. On an end of the hollow gear <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> opposite of the orifice is located a plurality of teeth <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> on its inside circumference. The hollow gear <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> generally has a cylindrical shape with the plurality of teeth <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> on an inside circumference thereof. A double planet reduction gear <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is in contact with the teeth of the hollow gear <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that a plurality of double planet reduction gears <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are arranged around the circumference of the sun gear <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and hollow gear <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>.

The first tab <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> is connected to the axle housing <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>, while the second tab <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> is connected to a sun gear <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> and a third tab <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> is connected to the differential housing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. The shift lever <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> is capable of moving such that the shift arm <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> engages the first <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> and second tab <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> to one another or the second <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> and third tab <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> to one another depending on the need for a high gear or low range gear in the all wheel drive vehicle. It should also be noted that the shift arm <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> may be placed in a disconnect position wherein only the second tab <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> is contacted by the shift arm <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> of the shift lever mechanism <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight>. The sun gear <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> has a plurality of teeth on the outer surface of both ends <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>384</bold></highlight> thereof, is placed around a stub shaft <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> of the rear axle housing <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>. The sun gear <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> generally has a cylindrical shape with the plurality of teeth on both ends thereof connected by a long narrow body <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A differential housing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> is rotatably supported within the axle housing <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> by a first set and a second set of bearings <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>. The differential housing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> also includes a notch <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> on an inside surface thereof. The differential housing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> includes a differential gear set <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> that is rotatably supported within the differential housing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. The differential gear set <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> includes a first <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> and a second side gear <highlight><bold>394</bold></highlight> and a first <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight> and a second pinion gear. The differential gear set <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> also includes a differential pin <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight> which is connected to an inside surface of the differential housing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> and is also rotatably connected to the first <highlight><bold>396</bold></highlight> and second pinion gears. A hollow gear <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is located on an inside surface of the differential housing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> opposite of a ring gear <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> which is located on an outer surface of the differential housing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. The ring gear <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> engages with the driving gear <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> to rotate the differential housing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> within the axle housing <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>. The hollow gear <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> has a plurality of teeth <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> located in a ring like manner on the inner surface of the differential housing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the hollow gear <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may also be a separate gear and casing that is secured to the inner surface of the differential housing, not integral like the described gear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A single planet reduction gear <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is in contact with and engages the plurality of teeth <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> of the hollow gear and the plurality of teeth <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> of the sun gear within the differential housing. The single planet reduction gear <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> generally has a cylindrical shape with an orifice through the middle thereof. The outer surface of the single planet reduction gear <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> has a plurality of teeth <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> that mate with the hollow gear teeth <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> and the sun gear teeth <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that a plurality of single planet reduction gears <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are located around the circumference of the sun gear <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment a total number of eight single planet reduction gears are equidistantly spaced around the circumference around the sun gear <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>, but it should be noted other quantities and arrangements of the gear may be used. Each of the plurality of the single planet reduction gears <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> has a planet pin <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> placed through the orifice of the single planet reduction gear <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The planet pin <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is secured to a planet gear carrier <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> on one end thereof. The planet gear carrier <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> is located within the notch <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the differential housing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> and generally has a ring like appearance. The planet gear carrier <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> also includes a plurality of orifices through which the planet pins <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> are secured. The opposite end of the planet pin <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> is connected to an axle differential carrier <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> which generally has a L-shaped cross section. The axle differential carrier <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of orifices that receive the planet pins <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of single planet reduction gear <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The axle differential carrier <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> also includes a radially positioned orifice that receives the differential pin <highlight><bold>398</bold></highlight> therein. The axle differential carrier <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> provides input force to the bevel differential gear set <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> of the rear differential housing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In operation the all wheel drive system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, that includes a reduction gear integrated in one of the axles provides that the torque in all of the drive line components, located in front of the reduction gear in the torque power flow, are designed for normal torque in a high range gear of the all wheel drive system. This torque is usually limited by the maximum engine torque available. The drive line components that are designed for this normal torque in high gear include the transfer case, the center differential <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the front axle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the front differential housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the front right hand side shaft <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the front left hand side shaft <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and the prop shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that connects the center differential <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the front axle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the prop shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that connects the center differential <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is also capable of being designed for normal torque power flow in the high gear position. Hence, in normal operation the basic torque split between the front axle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is 60/40 with the front axle receiving 60% of the torque and the rear axle receiving 40%. However, it should be noted that other basic torque splits that can be used are 50/50 front to rear and 40/60 with the front receiving 40% of the power. These basic torque splits are applied while in the high range mode or high gear of the all wheel drive vehicle. During any wheel slip in any of the front wheels or rear wheels <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> the appropriate torque will be sent to the axle that has a superior grip on the slippery road conditions. Once the slip condition is neutralized the basic torque split will be reapplied to the all wheel drive line. Therefore, any slip conditions encountered either due to slippery road conditions, such as snow, ice, mud or water and/or from turning of the vehicle, the outer wheels spin faster than the inner wheels, the center differential <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will provide the necessary torque to the axle with the better grip and to the wheel with a better grip until straight line driving is encountered and the basic rate split ratio is resumed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> When the all wheel drive vehicle is selected to go into a low range or reduction gear mode, the operator is generally going off road with his vehicle and/or interested in towing a very large cargo. After the selection is made for the low range mode a reduction gear, i.e., either the double planet reduction gear <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> or in the alternate embodiment a single planet reduction gear <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, will reduce the speed and increase the torque on the rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Hence, the rear prop shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will have to spin faster than the front prop shaft <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to provide the same wheel speed. This difference between the rear and front prop shaft speeds is compensated in the center differential <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which is permanently differentiating in the low range mode. Therefore, the low range mode reduction gear integrated in the rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will only work in a permanent all wheel drive vehicle with a center differential <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The higher rear axle torque while in the low range mode creates a change in the torque split between the front <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and rear axles <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to provide a more rear axle dominate split. Such examples of the torque split change are as follows.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the low range ratio for the single planet reduction gear ratio can be anywhere between 1.5 to 1.7 but for the double planet arrangement the gear ratio could be anywhere between 2.0 to 2.2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The arrangement of the reduction gear in the rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will lead to the shift of the torque split to more rear dominate which is preferable in towing situations or off road conditions and will also better match the optimal torque distribution of an all wheel drive vehicle for traction. It should be noted that in the case of having the reduction gear arrangement in the front axle the effect will be just the opposite as shown above in the table by exchanging the front and rear splits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> the present invention has the reduction gear in the rear axle <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> in combination with an open bevel gear differential <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>. In operation the reduction gear is arranged beside the axle bevel gear differential <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> inside the differential housing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>. The planet gears <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are driven by the hollow gear <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> which is connected to part of the differential housing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> in the single planet reduction gear <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The planet gear carrier <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> drives the axle differential carrier <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> which are input for the bevel differential gear <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. The shift lever <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> is used to either connect the sun gear <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> to the differential housing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight> which forces the planetary gear <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> to be the input or to move the shift arm <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> such that the axle housing <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> is connected to the sun gear <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> which provides for stationary input. If the sun gear <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> is connected to the differential housing <highlight><bold>364</bold></highlight>, i.e., the lever arm <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> connects tabs <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>378</bold></highlight> and the planetary gear <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> will be locked and the gear ratio will be <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> without idling of the gear. This gear ratio of 1 to 1 is provided for in the high gear. When the operator selects the low range option the shift mechanism <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> will shift the shift arm <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight> thus connecting tabs <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight> to one another in effect connecting the sun gear <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> to the axle housing <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> and activating the planet gears <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. This makes the hollow gear <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> the input from the axle housing <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and the planet carrier <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> the output which transfers the output to the axle differential carrier <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> which sends the output to the differential bevel gear set <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> providing for an achievable gear ratio of 1.7. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The double planetary gear system as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, will have the reduction gear <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> actuated where the shift arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is removed such that the sun gear <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> locks with the axle housing <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, this means the planet gear carrier <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> will be connected to the differential housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> thus acting as input while the hollow gear <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> will act as output and drive the axle bevel gear differential <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. This arrangement will allow for an achievable gear ratio of approximately 2.2. It should also be noted that if the shift arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is placed in a neutral position, i.e. only contacting tab <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> it can act as an axle disconnect device thus completely disconnecting the rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the all wheel drive system. Thus, in the high range the sun gear <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is connected to the differential housing <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which is the input and spins at the same speed as the differential housing. Thus, this allows for the basic torque split to be used in a rear axle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a graph of the tractive force versus the percent gradient in high and low range for a vehicle with a basic torque split of 60% front and 40% rear. As can be seen in the graph, when in the low range the torque split shifts predominantly to the rear, i.e., approximately 43% front and 57% back and the traction potential of the vehicle is significantly improved. It should be noted that this effect is even more pronounced if additional considerations are given to the dynamic weight redistribution that is found under acceleration. Therefore, the tractive force in low range, which is generally preferred by the operator of the vehicle, increases because of the predominately rear shift of the basic torque split when the low range gear is activated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It should also be noted that a second alternate embodiment has been considered wherein the reduction gear would be arranged in front of the differential housing on the pinion shaft, which is spinning with the prop shaft speed, directly in front of the rear axle housing. It should also be noted that in the all wheel drive vehicle of the present invention, that only the rear side shafts have to be designed for maximum torque found in the low range while all of the other drive line components only have to be designed for the max engine torque as found in the high gear range of the all wheel drive vehicle. It also should be noted that a gear ratio of up to 2.7 may be achieved by a double planetary reduction gear setup. Therefore, with the invention being used on a full time all wheel drive system that has three open differentials it reduces the weight, packaging and design needs for a low range gear by allowing all of the drive line components in front of the reduction gear to remain the same while only having to change and design for maximum low end torque on the rear side shafts and the reduction gear system within the rear differential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described in an illustrative manner, it is to be understood that the terminology which has been used is intended to be in the nature of words or description rather than of limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. Therefore, within the scope of the appended claims, the present invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described. </paragraph>
