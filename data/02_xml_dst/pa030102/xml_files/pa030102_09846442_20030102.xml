<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to phosphate ester base stock compositions comprising mixed n-butyl/isobutyl phosphate esters and to aircraft hydraulic fluid compositions comprising such base stocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. State of the Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Hydraulic fluids used in the hydraulic systems of aircraft must meet exacting specifications set by aircraft manufacturers. Accordingly, the components of aircraft hydraulic fluids are carefully chosen to balance, among other properties, stability, compatibility, density, toxicity and the like. Whether the selected components can, in fact, be balanced to meet these specifications is unpredictable. Moreover, the amounts of individual components used in compositions which meet the specifications is not a priori predictable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Trialkyl phosphate esters, such as tri-n-butyl phosphate and triisobutyl phosphate, have been used previously as base stocks for aviation hydraulic fluids. For example, trialkyl phosphate ester base stocks are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,551, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In particular, low density aviation hydraulic fluids, i.e., fluids having a density below about 1.020 g/L at 25&deg; C., have conventionally been prepared using tri-n-butyl phosphate as the major component of the base stock. However, tri-n-butyl phosphate is known to be a skin irritant and minimizing its concentration is desirable. Alternatively, low density fluids employing triisobutyl phosphate as the major component have had difficulty meeting the low volatility and low temperature viscosity requirements imposed on aviation hydraulic fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It has now been discovered that phosphate ester base stocks comprising mixed isobutyl/n-butyl phosphate esters, i.e., n-butyl diisobutyl phosphate or di-n-butyl isobutyl phosphate or mixtures thereof, have surprising and unexpected properties when compared to base stocks containing major amounts of tri-n-butyl phosphate and triisobutyl phosphate or physical mixtures thereof. Specifically, it has been found that by employing mixed isobutyl/n-butyl phosphate esters in the base stock of the fluid, an unexpected, surprising balance of properties critical to aviation hydraulic fluids is obtained, including acceptable hydrolytic stability, high flash point, good anti-wear properties, acceptable erosion protection, acceptable low temperature flow properties (viscosity), and elastomer compatibility. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> This invention is directed to novel phosphate ester base stock compositions and to aircraft hydraulic fluid compositions containing such base stocks. The compositions described herein are conventionally prepared by blending the components of the composition together until homogeneous. The blending process may be conducted as a single step process where all of the components are combined and then blended or may be conducted as a multi-step process where two or more of the components are combined and blended and additional components are added to the blended mixture and the resulting mixture further blended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the erosion inhibitor (and optionally the antioxidants that are normally solids) is preblended with at least one of the phosphate ester base stock components to ensure complete dissolution of the erosion inhibitor before addition to the preblend of the remaining additives and phosphate ester component(s). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The phrase &ldquo;the base stock composition produces no more than 25 % elastomer seal swell&rdquo; means that under industry standard testing conditions, such as Aerospace Industry Association NAS-1613 or Boeing D6-3614, where an approved elastomer is immersed in the aircraft hydraulic fluid and exposed to severe aging conditions such as 334 hours at 225&deg; F. (107.2&deg; C.), elastomer seal swell does not exceed 25%. Preferably elastomer seal swell does not exceed 20%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;alkyl&rdquo; as used herein refers to a monovalent branched or unbranched saturated hydrocarbon group preferably having from 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 8 carbon atoms and still more preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms. This term is exemplified by groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, n-hexyl, n-octyl, tert-octyl, triisopropyl (C9), tetraisopropyl (C12), and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Cycloalkyl&rdquo; refers to cyclic alkyl groups of from 3 to 10 carbon atoms having a single cyclic ring or multiple condensed rings which can be optionally substituted with from 1 to 3 alkyl groups. Such cycloalkyl groups include, by way of example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclooctyl, 1-methylcyclopropyl, 2-methylcyclopentyl, 2-methylcyclooctyl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Aryl&rdquo; refers to an unsaturated aromatic carbocyclic group of from 6 to 14 carbon atoms having a single ring (e.g., phenyl) or multiple condensed rings (e.g., naphthyl). Such aryl groups may be unsubstituted, such as phenyl, naphthyl and the like, or may be substituted with, for example, one or more alkyl groups and preferably 1-2 alkyl groups, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl or mixtures thereof. Representative alkyl-substituted aryl groups include, by way of illustration, 4-isopropylphenyl, 4-tert-butylphenyl, triisopropylated aryl, tetraisopropylated aryl, and the like. Examples of suitable triaryl phosphates include, but are not limited to, triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, tri-(isopropylphenyl) phosphate, tri-(tert-butylphenyl) phosphate and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The phosphate ester base stock composition of this invention comprises n-butyl diisobutyl phosphate or di-n-butyl isobutyl phosphate or a mixture of n-butyl diisobutyl phosphate and di-n-butyl isobutyl phosphate. n-Butyl diisobutyl phosphate (BDIBP) and di-n-butyl isobutyl phosphate (DBIBP) have formulas I and II, respectively:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a mixture of I and II are employed in the base stock and preferably this mixture employs from about 1 to about 99% by weight I and from about 99 to 1 % by weight II. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The phosphate ester base stock composition may also contain minor amounts, preferably 30 weight % or less, more preferably 25 weight % or less, of other trialkyl phosphate esters, such as triisobutyl phosphate. Preferably, the phosphate ester base stock composition contains less than 15 weight %, more preferably less than 10 weight %, still more preferably less than 5 weight %, and yet more preferably less than 2 weight %, of tri-n-butyl phosphate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the phosphate ester base fluid of this invention further comprises a sufficient amount of one or more triaryl phosphates such that the base stock composition produces no more than 25 % elastomer seal swell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the phosphate ester base stock composition of this invention comprises from about 5 to about 15 weight percent, based on the total weight of the base stock, of one or more triaryl phosphates, the remainder comprising a phosphate ester selected from the group consisting of n-butyl diisobutyl phosphate, di-n-butyl isobutyl phosphate and mixtures thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the phosphate ester base stock composition comprises 5 to 15 weight percent of tri-(isopropylphenyl) phosphate, the remainder comprising a phosphate ester selected from the group consisting of n-butyl diisobutyl phosphate, di-n-butyl isobutyl phosphate and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The phosphate ester base stock compositions of this invention may be combined with one or more additives to provide novel aircraft hydraulic fluid compositions. The additive package employed in the phosphate ester base stock will typically comprises about 5 to about 15 weight percent of the aviation hydraulic fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The n-butyl diisobutyl phosphate and di-n-butyl isobutyl phosphate (or mixtures thereof) employed in this invention can be prepared using well-known procedures and reagents. For example, as discussed in Gunderson and Hart, Synthetic Lubricants (Reinhold Publishing, 1962) at page 106, such mixed phosphate esters are typically prepared by reacting phosphorous oxychloride with a mixture of the corresponding alcohols or the alkali metal alkoxides. For example, n-butyl diisobutyl phosphate and di-n-butyl isobutyl phosphate can be prepared by reacting phosphorus oxychloride with the appropriate ratio of n-butanol and isobutanol or with, for example, sodium n-butoxide and sodium isobutoxide. It may be necessary to separate any undesired tri-n-butyl phosphate or triisobutyl phosphate for the desired mixed ester(s) by, for example, fractional distillation. This reaction may also be conducted sequentially. For example, by first reacting one mole equivalent of phosphorous oxychloride with one mole equivalent of n-butanol or sodium n-butoxide and then reacting the intermediate product with two mole equivalents of isobutanol or sodium isobutoxide, a mixture containing predominately n-butyl diisobutyl phosphate is prepared. Similarly, a mixture containing predominately di-n-butyl isobutyl phosphate is prepared by first reacting one mole equivalent of phosphorous oxychloride with one mole equivalent of isobutanol or sodium isobutoxide and then reacting the intermediate product with two mole equivalents of n-butanol or sodium n-butoxide. After fractional distillation to remove any undesired by-products, the n-butyl diisobutyl phosphate and di-n-butyl isobutyl phosphate prepared by these methods may be further mixed to achieve the desired ratio of mixed phosphate ester components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, di-n-butyl isobutyl phosphate can be prepared by first reacting phosphorous trichloride with about 3 mole equivalents of dry n-butanol in an inert diluent, such as benzene, to afford tri-n-butyl phosphite. This reaction is typically conducted at a temperature of about 0&deg; C. for about 1 to about 6 hours. The resulting tri-n-butyl phosphite is typically not isolated, but is immediately reacted with one mole equivalent (based on the phosphorous trichloride) of sulfuryl chloride at a temperature of about 0&deg; C. for about 1 to about 6 hours to afford di-n-butyl chlorophosphate. The di-n-butyl chlorophosphate is then reacted with one mole equivalent of isobutanol in the presence of excess pyridine in an inert diluent, such as benzene, to afford di-n-butyl isobutyl phosphate. This reaction is typically conducted initially at a temperature of about 0&deg; C. and then allowed to stir at ambient temperature for about 24 to about 48 hours. If desired, the resulting di-n-butyl isobutyl phosphate can be purified by distillation (68&deg; C. at 0.02 torr). By employing isobutanol followed by n-butanol in this procedure, n-butyl diisobutyl phosphate can also be prepared. </paragraph>
