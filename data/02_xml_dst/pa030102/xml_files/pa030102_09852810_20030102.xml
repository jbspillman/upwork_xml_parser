<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a system, a medium and a method for assessing the culture of an organization and making improvements based on the assessment, and more particularly, to a computer architecture and computer implemented and/or assisted process of conducting a cultural assessment of an organization and generating recommendations and/or specific actions responsive thereto. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is known in the art to conduct employee satisfaction surveys. An exemplary conventional survey system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,615,134 issued to Newsham et al. In that patent, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> user switches on a Personal Computer and is asked certain demographic questions that are only asked once. These demographic questions may comprise queries relating to age, sex, and education of the subject. Other questions relating to the physical location and orientation of the computer terminal may optionally be asked. The responses to these questions are then recorded on the system&apos;s hard disk. As can be seen from viewing the flow diagram, when a questionnaire is scheduled, a banner appears to ask the user if he or she wishes to respond to questions. If the answer is no, the questions may be rescheduled. Otherwise, the questions appear on a display terminal, and the selected responses are saved to the disk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Another exemplary conventional system to conduct surveys is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,026,387 issued to Kesel. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates in block diagram form a schematic of the architecture of the conventional system disclosed in the patent issued to Kesel. That system includes a consumer feedback apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for collecting, analyzing, and reporting consumer comments on goods and services offered for sale to consumers by a provider. The provider locates a comment receiving station <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a convenient location for consumers to selectively operate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> a recorder for receiving oral comments from the consumer C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> After the comment is recorded by the consumer C, a date and time is associated with the comment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The recording station <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a storage device for recording a plurality of comments from one or more consumers C. The recording station includes a digital telephone message recording device. Such devices typically include a date and time &ldquo;stamp&rdquo; for recorded messages. The provider may assign to consumers a unique identifier <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The consumer C selectively enters the identification code upon recording the comment <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and upon making purchases. In this way, the provider tracks the comments and purchasing activity of the consumer C. The collection of oral comments with the time stamp and consumer identification <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are then communicated <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to an analyzer for analysis and recording on a data base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Each discrete oral comment by consumer C is analyzed <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a normalized representation is created. Normalized representations include comment factors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprising a comment category <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, at least one descriptor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, at least one dimension <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and an attitude <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The comment factors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are used to convert the raw oral comments into useable information about goods and services, i.e., for statistical analysis, whether the comment is a compliment, complaint, or idea for improvement. The normalized representation is preferably stored on a database driven by a microprocessor computer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which includes a display screen, microprocessor, a keyboard, and a mouse-type entry device. Using a reporter <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, normalized representations are selected according to the category, descriptor, dimension, attitude, and time. The normalized representations are used for reporting <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> information to the provider, for responding to perceptions of consumers about delivery and execution of services and goods and for monitoring levels of customer satisfaction according to a provider-defined index. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Many companies conduct employment satisfaction surveys. A recent gallop poll conducted among the employees of the fortune five hundred companies found that eighty percent of those companies conduct surveys. However, sixty percent of those responded to the poll reported a negative impact as result of the surveys. The cause of the negative impact can be manifold. The first reason may be that the conventional surveys can be either inaccurate and/or incomplete, thereby leading to incorrect survey results and incorrect remedial actions taken (or not taken) by the companies. The second reason may be that the conventional surveys may not provide follow up sessions and concrete implementation remedial actions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In another aspect that may not relate to the above-described conventional employee survey system but may be relevant to the present invention, computer tools for assisting a person to make decisions are known in the art. An example of such a tool is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,995,728 issued to Forman. This exemplary tool is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>. This computer implemented tool is preferably stored on any computer readable tangible medium, such as a floppy diskette hard drive, computer memory, and the like, for execution by the computer hardware. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, Step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the process is for a decision maker (or decision makers) to define alternative solutions to a problem or opportunity (including description and abbreviation) on a computer screen. For example, in deciding whether to expand a company, alternatives might be to (A) Expand the company and build a new sub-division, or (B) Make no plans or further inquiries for expansion at this time, or (C) Wait 6 months, meanwhile collecting additional information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the process is for the decision maker(s) to identify pros and cons for each alternative(s). The computer organizes this process by maintaining one screen for each alternative. A pro for one alternative might be a con for another alternative. For example, a pro for one alternative might be low cost, while a con for another alternative might be high cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the process, the decision maker, guided by the computer, iteratively repeats Steps S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> until all alternatives have been identified and entered by the decision maker into the computer system. Step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the process is for the computer to combine and list the pros and cons for all alternatives. Each pro or con will &ldquo;point&rdquo; to at least one objective. For example, a pro of reliable points to an objective of reliability. A con of expensive, points to an objective of low cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the process is for the decision maker to use the computer facilities provided for &ldquo;converting&rdquo; each pro and con to one or more objectives by manipulating each pro and con and identifying the objective(s) it points to. If an objective has not yet been identified (based on the pro or con to another alternative), the decision maker can use the computer facilities to drag and drop each pro and con to the &ldquo;objectives&rdquo; list according to Step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Note: it might be possible for a pro or con to point to more than one objective-for example, a car with a pro of &ldquo;large&rdquo; might point to the following objectives: comfort, carrying capacity, safety and fuel economy. One by one, each pro-con is converted to an objective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is a decision point for the decision maker to repeat steps S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> until all pros and cons have been converted into objectives. At Steps S<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the computer allows the decision maker to enter other objectives that come to mind (but do not correspond to any pros or cons) directly into an objectives list/hierarchy, or to construct a hierarchy by clustering related objectives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the computer algorithm generates a display of the treeview of the resulting hierarchy of objectives. In Steps S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the computer can convert the treeview into a &ldquo;clusterview&rdquo;. The computer maintained clusterview can be manipulated by the decision maker&mdash;rearranging, combining, separating and adding objectives as desired. Other pros/cons or objectives that come to mind are added by the decision maker in Steps S<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The treeviews and clusterviews are kept in synchronization by the computer and the decision maker can switch between either views in Step S<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In Step S<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the computer appends the alternatives to the bottom level of the objectives hierarchy to produce an evaluation &amp; choice model. The decision maker is then able to utilize this developed list of objectives in the decision making process, and makes a decision responsive thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The above-described decision assisting tool does not assist a user in assessing the culture of an organization and making improvements based on the assessment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Additional short comings of the conventional employee survey systems and the decision assisting tools will be clearly evident from the detailed description of the present inventions that follows. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the present invention. Such embodiments are provided by way of explanation of the present invention, which is not intended to be limited thereto. In fact, those of ordinary skill in the art may appreciate upon reading the present specification and viewing the present drawings that various modifications and variations can be made thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> For example, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used on other embodiments to yield a still further embodiment. Additionally, certain features may be interchanged with similar devices or features not mentioned yet which perform the same or similar functions. It is therefore intended that such modifications and variations are included within the totality of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In order to provide the context in which the present invention is to be practiced, a description of the overall process in accordance with embodiments of the present invention is first provided. Subsequently, specific exemplary embodiments with various steps are described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The first concept to be described in order to provide the proper context for embodiments of the present invention relates to organizations that would undergo the processes in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Examples of organizations can be any company having a number of employees (e.g., 100 or more), a sub-unit (e.g., a department, a division or the like) within a company, a social club, etc. Basically, an organization for the purpose of the present invention is any group of people in which its culture can be assessed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The second concept to be described in order to provide the proper context for embodiments of the present invention relates to various elements that constitute a culture or set of cultures of an organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A first element that contributes to the culture of the organization are assumptions held by its members (e.g., the employees of a company). In the context of the present invention the assumptions relate to subjective interpretations of the members that have been accepted as facts or givens even though the interpretations may be inaccurate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A second element that may constitute or contribute to the culture of the organization are its norms, customs, routines perceived by the members of the organization. This element relates to day-to-day ways the members behave, interact and work together within the organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> A third element that may constitute or contribute to the culture of the organization is power. This element of power is not just the title of the person holding the power, but the ability that the person can influence meaningful decisions within the organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A fourth element that may constitute or contributes to the culture of the organization is its positive/negative rights and rituals. These elements relate to ceremonies and events of the organization. The ceremonies and events may signal to or inform the members the value and emphasis of the organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> A fifth element that may constitute or contribute to the culture of the organization in its roles and responsibilities of the members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> A sixth element that may constitute or contribute to the culture of the organization are its positive/negative stories and myths of the organization. This element helps describe the history of the organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> A seventh element that may constitute or contribute to the culture of the organization is its structure. The structure relates to the framework that identifies relationships, communications, and power outside of the members of the organization (i.e., informal organizational chart). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> An eighth element that may constitute or contribute to the culture of the organization relates to its symbols. The symbols in context of the present invention relate to non-verbal communications that may help explain values and beliefs of the organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A ninth element that may constitute or contribute to the culture of the organization are its systems and rules. This element relates to methods to control, measure, and reinforce behaviors of the members of the organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A tenth element that may constitute or contribute to the culture of an organization is its values. This element relates to what the organization cares about the most, regardless of the external environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The above-described elements of the culture of an organization are provided only as examples. These elements may not constitute an exhaustive list of the elements of culture of an organization, and do not necessarily apply to every organization. It should be noted, however, that in embodiments of the present invention the complex nature of culture of an organization is broken into manageable elements. These manageable elements are then used in developing the overall strategy in assessing the culture in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Based on or using one or more of the elements of the culture described above and/or other elements of culture, the computer architecture and computer implemented and/or assisted method of the present invention assesses the culture of an organization and makes improvements thereon. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a high-level flow chart diagram that includes the process steps of one embodiment of the present invention. As a first step, data is collected from the members of the organization. For instance, group meetings are held (e.g., a focus group meetings) and/or individual interviews are conducted to collect data (step <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>), among others. The collected data is then analyzed to identify themes/issues in the data (step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>). Based on the identified themes/issues in the data, an implementation plan is created (step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>). The implementation plan is performed during an implementation phase. During and/or after the implementation phase, the progress of the implementation is assessed (step <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>). When sufficient improvements on the culture of the organization have been determined or measured, the process of the present invention is optionally completed after the implementation phase (step <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>). When there has not been sufficient improvement on the culture of the organization, the process may optionally be repeated from, for example, the data collecting step (step <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>) and/or from the implementation step (step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>). The above-described high-level flow chart and its individual steps are described below in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Before specific embodiments of the present invention are described, a number of actors who participate in embodiments of the present invention are introduced. The first actor is a facilitator(s) who carries out a number of steps in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. A facilitator can be a person. However, many steps described below as to be performed by a facilitator can be automated (e.g., computerized) to the extent that they are known in the computer automation art. Examples of the automated survey systems have been described above in connection with the conventional survey collection systems. The second actor is a client. A client can be a manager, an officer or the like who made the request to conduct the process of embodiments of the present invention, to develop improvements thereon in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The third actors are a number of members (e.g., employees) who belong to the organization. The members may include the client and employees who may or may not be participating in the processes of various embodiments of the present invention. In the following description, the organization is depicted as a company having employees and a management team. It should be noted, however, any type of organization as described above can undergo the processes in accordance with the embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Now referring back to the data collecting step (step <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>), <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the detailed steps that may be carried out as part of step <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. The first step in collecting data consults the client (step <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>) and devises data collection logistics (step <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>). Subsequently, a set of generic questions is customized in order to assess accurately the culture of the organization (step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>). It should be noted that these steps can be performed in parallel or sequentially. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> During the client consulting step (step <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>), the facilitator provides an overview of the steps that are to be performed by the facilitator with respect to events and/or milestones that may take place in conducting the processes of embodiments of the present invention. In this step, the facilitator can first explain to the client, for example, the time and expense that may be required to be expended by the organization in order to conduct the processes of embodiments of the present invention. This would help the client to perform cost/benefit analysis before being fully committed to undergo the processes of embodiments of the present invention. Secondly, during this step the facilitator may, for example, outline time and resources needed by the client for a successful execution of the processes of embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The client consulting step (step <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>) may be conducted in person by the facilitator. In another embodiment, the consulting step may be conducted by asking the client to read published material (e.g., printed brochures and/or a Web Site that the client can log on and receive Web Pages containing information relating to this step). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> During the client consultation step, the facilitator may also ask one or more of the following exemplary questions to the client (the &ldquo;consultation questions&rdquo;): </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> 1. Is this the right time to make a commitment to conduct the processes of embodiments of the present invention, i.e., to measure the culture of your organization&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> 2. What is the number of employees that can participate in the process of embodiments of the present invention&quest; It should be noted that in embodiments of the present invention 90-95% statistical confidence factor (SCF) is desired. Other standard statistical confidence factors or statistical distributions may optionally be used that indicate a sufficient probability of successful measurement and/or improvement of the culture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> 3. Is it possible to breakdown the members into a number of organizational groups&quest; Examples of possible organizational groups may be defined by functional departments (e.g., accounting dept., engineering dept., legal dept., secretarial support, etc.), by shifts (e.g., the morning shift, the afternoon shift and the evening shift), by pay grades, etc. The organizational group breakdown may depend upon the size of each organizational group and/or the clients desire to assess the culture of certain organizational groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> 4. What is the ideal timeline for the client&quest; This would depend upon factors such as the urgency with which the client desires to assess the culture, availability of the members of the organization to participate in the processes of the present invention and other similar factors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Now turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in which the logistics step (step <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>) is described in more detail in accordance with one exemplary embodiment, the first step in the data collection logistics step is to determine the number of focus groups (step <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>). The second step is to determine the number of individual interviews to conduct (step <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>). The third step is to determine the number of facilitators needed to conduct the cultural measurement and improvement processes of the present invention (step <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>). The fourth step is to determine if the above determined numbers meet a minimum objective (e.g., more than 90-95% statistical confidence factor). If it is not met, then the three determining steps (steps <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>) are optionally repeated. If it is met, then the facilitator uses numbers determined in the previous steps as the basis or input to additional steps in the present invention, either alone, in conjunction with other data. The detailed nature of the focus groups and individual groups and individual groups are described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In the step of determining the number of focus groups to be held (step <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>), the facilitator may determine the number of focus groups required for each organizational group. It should be noted that the size of a focus group is preferred to be 12 with a minimum number (e.g., six). Focus group meetings are conducted preferably with two facilitators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> In the step of determining the number of individual interviews to be held (step <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>), if an organizational group is rather large (e.g., the supervisory staff is large with more than 20 members), then the focus groups and individual interviews can be combined into one session. It should be noted that each focus group and individual interview may require approximately 90 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The facilitator may also receive the hours of operation the client would like to conduct the processes of the embodiments of the present invention. Based upon the information collected and determinations made above, the facilitator may provide a master schedule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> An exemplary &ldquo;Master Schedule&rdquo; may include the following entries: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;During our staff meeting, we reviewed all schedules and would propose the following master template for your cultural assessment process.&rdquo;

<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Now referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in step <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, a set of generic data gathering tools are customized based on the needs of the organization. The generic data gathering tools include one or more of the following: an individual interview guideline, employee feedback sheet, and focus group meeting guideline, among others. Customizations include, for example, length of interviews, number of facilitators, pre-written multiple choice feedback questions, and/or other customizations that reflect or are desirable for a specific organization. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">GENERIC INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEW GUIDELINE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> The following is an exemplary generic guideline to be followed by the facilitator when conducting individual interviews with the participating members of the organization. In embodiments of the present invention, the guidelines are divided into five exemplary sections. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">First Section of the Generic Individual Interview Guideline </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The first section includes questions directed to collecting demographic information. Exemplary questions can be as follows: &ldquo;What is the today&apos;s date&quest;&rdquo;; &ldquo;What is your name&quest;&rdquo;; &ldquo;What is the length of time you have been with the organization&quest;&ldquo;; &rdquo;What is your area of responsibility in the organization&quest;&rdquo;; &ldquo;What is the number of people reporting to you&quest;&rdquo;; and &ldquo;What is the length of time you have been at your current position&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Second Section of the Generic Individual Interview Guideline </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The facilitator may first ask the following four (4) questions from a &ldquo;big picture, 20,000 foot level.&rdquo; The facilitator may ask that the responses may focus on customer, shareholder, and/or employee satisfaction/expectations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The four questions are: 1) &ldquo;What&apos;s going right&quest;&rdquo;; 2) &ldquo;What&apos;s misunderstood and/or needs more clarification&quest;&rdquo;; 3) &ldquo;What&apos;s frustrating&quest;&ldquo;; and 4) &ldquo;What needs to be changed and/or improved&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>

</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Fifth Section of the Generic Individual Interview Guideline </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> The facilitator may wrap up the interview session by asking the interviewee to briefly describe the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;The basic assumptions we have about people in (YOUR ORGANIZATION/FACILITY) are&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;In the last twelve (12) months, I believe our organization/facility is a better/same/worse place to work. Choose one. Explain why&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In the above described Generic Interview Guideline, only qualitative responses are solicited in the first, second, third and fifth sections. However, in the fourth section, quantitative (e.g., the rating) responses are also solicited. Of course, other types of questions may be asked and/or other arrangements or combination of the questions may be sued for this overall process step. Further, the above process steps may be implemented with the assistance of the computer system described below, and/or the data derived there from are entered into the computer system for processing, as described further below. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">GENERIC EMPLOYEE FEEDBACK SHEET </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The following is an exemplary generic employee feedback sheet that asks the members to review the statements below. After each statement, the members are asked to put a rating of 1-10 (e.g., quantitative responses). A rating of &ldquo;1&rdquo; is poor; and &ldquo;10&rdquo; is excellent. Other standard points systems may also be utilized, in this step as well as other steps in the process of the present invention, as described herein. Additional comments may be written by the interviewee (e.g., qualitative responses). The following two exemplary groups are to be rated for each of the questions: direct supervisor of the member responding to the questions and the entire management team of the organization. </paragraph>

Any number and/or combination of the above statements may be used, as well as other statements than an employee may comment on regarding the organization. The next section describes focus group meeting guidelines. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">FOCUS GROUP MEETING GUIDELINES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> First, the facilitator may introduce and welcome the members participating in the focus group meeting. In particular, the facilitator may explain the purpose of the focus group meeting. For instance, the facilitator may state that the members in the focus group have been carefully selected by the management team. The facilitator may also state that the focus group meeting does not necessarily replace the &ldquo;All Employee Survey to be held later.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Following the introduction, the facilitator may also explain that there are three guarantees to the members who are participating in the focus group meeting. First, the participant focus group meeting is anonymous relative to the information provided by the participants. Second, the thought and concerns expressed in the focus meeting will be reported directly to the management. Third, the facilitator has encouraged the management team to be committed to the process and provide feedback as part of a 100-day action plan or other action plan. The facilitator may also promise to provide feedback to management on a specific date. One or more of those guarantees can also be omitted by the facilitator based on certain circumstances (e.g., the employee/management relationship). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Continuing to describe the focus group meeting, the facilitator may also state to the focus group that the facilitator is to determine the relationship between the members and their management team who are not present in the focus meeting. In particular, the facilitator may be concerned with determining the areas in which the members and their management team are connected (e.g., communicating with each other, and goals and rewards are clearly defined and well understood), and the areas in which the members and their management team are not connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The facilitator may also conduct one or more of the following exemplary exercises: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> 1. Words and Their Meanings Exercise: In this exercise the facilitator may ask the following questions: &ldquo;If we did something one-half of the time, what percentage would that equate to&quest;&rdquo;; and &ldquo;We also have some words/phrases/acronyms that we use at work that are well understood, and others that are not well understood.&rdquo; The facilitator may ask the members in the focus groups to list those words. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> 2. Trust Exercise&mdash;In this exercise, the facilitator asks the members to break into small groups and asks them to list the characteristics of someone that they trust very much, outside of the workplace. The facilitator then may ask to write the list of the characteristics that each small group has defined. The facilitator may then ask the participants to indicate which two or three characteristics of the management team of the organization, and which of the characteristics that the management team needs to improve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> 3. Ask to list what is going right at the organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> 4. Ask to list what is frustrating at the organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> 5. Walk the Talk exercise described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> 6. &ldquo;One thing, which must be realistic, that you would change to make the organization a better place to work in the next 90-120 days.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> 7. Pass out the employ feedback sheet and ask everyone to be honest and to not mark with identical responses to every question also includes blank spaces for comments and feedbacks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The above-described generic guidelines are provided herein as examples. Similar or other known standard data collection tool may also be used in embodiments of the present invention as long as it can measure culture of an organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Now referring to back <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when customizing (step <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>) the above, described guidelines, the following factors can also be considered by the facilitator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> 1. What terms need to be modified in the interview guide&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> 2. What &ldquo;management&rdquo; and &ldquo;senior management&rdquo; terms does the client want to include in their organization&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> 3. Where should additional customized questions, if applicable, be added to the interview guide and the employee feedback sheet&quest;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> 4. Ensure that if supervisory management focus groups are conducted that their quantitative measurement tool is the same as the one used in the interview guide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Continuing to describe <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the facilitator may also add client specific questions to generic guidelines (step <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>). It should be noted that in this step as well as any step in the process of the present invention, the client may request that client&apos;s specific questions be added to the generic guidelines or request some questions on the generic guidelines be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Exemplary specific questions may include the following questions: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> 1. &ldquo;The company will see benefits from the merger/realignment of John Doe Company and Division A of the company&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> 2. &ldquo;I see personal benefits coming from the merger/realignment of John Doe Company and Division A of the company&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> 3. &ldquo;I&apos;m concerned, either for enterprise or personally, about the overall merger/realignment&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> 4. &rdquo;Communications in our new Division A are improving . . . timeliness, methods, and level of detail&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> 5. &ldquo;I believe Division A&apos;s Senior management is serious about improving employee satisfaction&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> 6. &ldquo;I believe Division A&apos;s Senior management will take actions to address issues identified in this survey/assessment&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> Each of the above question can be rated on a scale of, for example, 1-5 (1&equals;Strongly Agree and 5&equals;Strongly Disagree). Blanks spaces may also be provide to allow the participants to write comments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> In the maintain integrity step (step <highlight><bold>413</bold></highlight>), the facilitator preferably ensures that responses to be collected from the members can be separated into the organizational groups and other relevant groupings of the members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> Following the customization of the generic guidelines, data (e.g., responses from the members) is gathered. There are a number of mechanisms to gather the data. More specifically, the above described generic and/or customized guidelines are used in gathering the data (e.g., the responses to the questions). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> graphically illustrates the different mechanisms, alternatively and/or in combination, with which to gather the data. As box <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> shows, the data can be gathered by holding a number of focus groups <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight>, each focus group being participated in by a number of members <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight>. Box <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> represents holding individual interviews with a number of different participating members of the organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, another way to gather the data is conducting &ldquo;visual walk around&rdquo; assessments (box <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>). While conducting the walking around assessments, the facilitator may determine whether or not there are any comments/concerns that can be substantiated and/or verified through a simple visual assessment. For instance, the verifiable comments/concerns may relate to cultural symbols, communication methods and timeliness, safety equipment, physical work conditions, management floor presence, consistency of practices/procedures, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> Yet another mechanism of gathering data is making available a computer terminal with which allows the members or other employees of the organization to enter the data voluntarily by identifying with their names or anonymously (box <highlight><bold>607</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> The above-described data gathering mechanisms can be performed as common exercises or as unique exercises. The common exercises are sessions during which any member can participate therein. The unique exercises are sessions during which members of a specific group may only be allowed to participate therein. An example of the unique focus group may be a senior management focus group meeting in which only senior managers are allowed to attend. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> Once the data is gathered (e.g., responses to questions in the generic/customized guidelines, answers/observations recorded by the facilitators, etc.), the gathered data can be input into an electronic database (step <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>). An exemplary database can be word processing software packages, e.g., Word, software spreadsheets, e.g., Excel, and/or a database management system, e.g., such as several standard databases provided by Oracle. Preferably, the integrity of the gathered data is maintained, or securely stored especially, with respect to the organizational groups. Various standard methods may be used to safely store the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> The following are some of the preferred and optional additional steps performed by the facilitator while compiling (step <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight>) the gathered data. The first is to compile each question in focus group exercises and record all qualitative answers. These answers are preferably not edited. The second is to compile each question in the interview guide and record all qualitative and all qualitative responses. These responses are also preferably not edited. The third is to create one or more spreadsheets for the responses to the employee feedback sheets from the participated members. The fourth is to create one or more spreadsheets for the responses to the interview guide &ldquo;rated&rdquo; questions. It should be noted that the compilation step (step <highlight><bold>609</bold></highlight>) and storing step (step <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight>) can be performed in any sequence or in parallel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The above-described data compilation and store steps can be performed manually or automatically using, for example, character recognition systems as known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, once the data has been gathered and compiled (e.g., collected), the data is then analyzed (step <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>). A report is then created (step <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>) based on the analyzed data. The reporting step may create an executive summary <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> and a detailed supplement report <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. These steps are described in detail in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, there are a number of data analysis steps. These steps can be performed manually or automatically using computerized text matching and data base searching algorithms known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> The first step is to separate the collected data into a number of data sets, e.g., three sets (step <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight>). The first set may be the data gathered during the common exercises, e.g., focus groups and individual interviews. The second set may be the data collected during unique focus group activities/exercises. The third set is the data collected during unique interview activities/exercises. As a part of the separating step, data collected from the various organizational groups are optionally maintained as separate groups (step <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> After the collected data has been separated, the next step is to conduct a trend analysis within each data set. The trend analysis is conducted by sorting and identifying one or more of the following themes/issues (step <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight>). Exemplary themes/issues may include: &ldquo;What themes/issues are repeated throughout the data set&quest;&rdquo;; &ldquo;What is the frequency of these themes/issues&quest;&rdquo;; &ldquo;Are there details which further support these themes/issues in the data set&quest;&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Are the themes/issues consistent across all the client specific organizational groups or are they unique to certain organizational groups&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> A list of themes/issues would have been identified as results of the trend analysis step. These identified themes/issues are preferably organized into a descending order of frequency, e.g., from the highest frequency theme/issue to the lowest (step <highlight><bold>807</bold></highlight>). This step is to be repeated for each of the data sets. The facilitator may attempt to discern any &ldquo;natural break&rdquo; in the themes/issues frequency. &ldquo;Natural break&rdquo; is defined as, for example, any indicated in the themes/issues that can be grouped together in a band of common frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> Subsequent to or in parallel with the above step, the averages of responses to the quantitative questions are calculated. More specifically, there are ten (10) quantitative questions in the interview guide, and twenty-three (23) quantitative questions in the employee feedback sheet, as discussed above. The averages of the responses to the quantitative questions are then sorted in a descending order (step <highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight>). This step is also performed on those customized questions which may require quantitative responses. The sorted average values may be referred as the quantitative data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> In the next step, the quantitative data is compared with the rated data collected in relation with the questions in the individual interview guideline (step <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>). For instance, an employee group may rate the (6) Communications question on the employee feedback sheet low while a management group may also rate their Communications question high. In another example, an employee group rated &ldquo;Showing Full Appreciation&rdquo; low while the management group rated the same question high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> The next step is to compare quantitative results in order to qualitative results to determine whether the themes/issues compliment or contradict each other (step <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>). An example of a contradiction is when the management team rated recognition as &ldquo;above average&rdquo; while the responses in the focus groups identified lack of appreciation as a frustration when answering qualitative questions. Another example pointing to a contradiction would be when employee groups rated &ldquo;Personal Rapport&rdquo; and &ldquo;Accessibility&rdquo; low on the employee feedback sheet while the management groups identified &ldquo;Building Relationships&rdquo; with employees as having no problem in the responses to the qualitative questions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the results of the above described steps <highlight><bold>807</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>, are analyzed in order to identify a certain number of themes/issues (e.g., <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, etc.) in each data set (step <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight>). Themes/issues that appear consistently across all data sets are also identified. In addition, the facilitator determines whether or not these identified themes/issues have been mentioned in qualitative data in, for example, a high frequency. Furthermore, the themes/issued identified may also be compared against data collected in other types of data collection mechanisms, e.g., words &amp; their meaning exercise, trust exercise, Gap analysis or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> The results of the above-step are compared with the responses to the question of &ldquo;What one realistic and specific thing would you do to improve morale and employee satisfaction in the next 90-120 days&quest;&rdquo; posed in the focus group meetings (step <highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> As the last step in the data analysis step, the results obtained above are summarized (step <highlight><bold>819</bold></highlight>) in an executive summary report, with a detailed supplement report attached thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> The executive summary may include information relating to one or more the following items. The first item identifies and discusses common themes/issues. The common themes/issues may include one or more of the following items to be discussed in a narrative format: a summary of basic assumptions management has on its staff and employees have of business; a summary of responses to &ldquo;What&apos;s going right/improving&quest;&rdquo;; a summary of responses to &ldquo;What&apos;s frustrating/disappointing&quest;&rdquo;; a summary of responses to &ldquo;What one realistic/specific thing would you do in the next 90-120 days to improve employee morale and satisfaction&quest;&rdquo; The common themes may also include one or more of the following items to be discussed in a qualitative format: a summary of responses to &ldquo;Is the organization a better, same, or worse place to work over the last 6 months&quest;&rdquo;; and a summary of responses to &ldquo;Is senior management serious about improving employee satisfaction&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0202" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0202&rsqb;</number> The second item in the executive summary identifies and discusses the results of the unique focus group meetings. The results of the unique focus group activities may include, for example, one or more of the following items to be discussed in a narrative format: a summary of responses in words and their meaning exercises; a summary of responses collected in the trust exercises; and a summary of the employee feedback sheet. The results of the unique focus group activities may include, for example, the following items to be discussed in a quantitative format; and a summary of responses to employee feedback select questions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0203" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0203&rsqb;</number> The third item in the executive summary identifies and discusses the results of the unique individual interview activities. The results of the unique interview activities may include, for example, one or more of the following items to be discussed: a summary of responses to the rated questions (highest and lowest scoring averages); and a summary of responses to the rated questions with significant average score differences between in the response of the management team and the employee groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0204" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0204&rsqb;</number> The fourth item in the executive summary identifies and discusses the results of the key action areas. In this item, one or more of the following issues may be discussed: employee suggestions by action area from &ldquo;one thing&rdquo; exercise; and additional consultant recommendations based on best practices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0205" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0205&rsqb;</number> The last item in the executive summary includes the recommended next steps. The next steps include, for example, two categories, namely, soak time questions and a next steps template. The next steps template will be described later in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. However, the following is a list of exemplary soak time questions. The facilitator may ask the members to consider answering the following exemplary questions individually and then as a member of a management team. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0206" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0206&rsqb;</number> 1. &ldquo;What was your first reaction to the cultural assessment survey results&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0207" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0207&rsqb;</number> 2. &ldquo;Were there any surprises&quest; If so, why was they a surprise&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0208" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0208&rsqb;</number> 3. &ldquo;&ldquo;What perceptions/beliefs were reinforced by this cultural assessment&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0209" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0209&rsqb;</number> 4. &ldquo;How will you address the employees&apos; expectations generated from this process&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0210" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0210&rsqb;</number> 5. &ldquo;How will you continue to do the things you are doing well&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0211" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0211&rsqb;</number> 6. &ldquo;What time, tools, resources, dollars will you allocate to improve employee satisfaction this year&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0212" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0212&rsqb;</number> 7. &ldquo;Do your current goals/objectives address the areas for opportunity outlined in the cultural assessment&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0213" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0213&rsqb;</number> 8. &ldquo;What areas can your facility address without outside help&quest; What areas need outside support&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0214" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0214&rsqb;</number> With respect to the detailed supplement report, this report provides details, for example, by the organizational groups. This may include one or more the following: a summary of responses from common interview and focus group questions; a summary of responses from words and their meanings exercises (focus groups); a summary of responses from trust exercises (focus group); a summary of responses from the GAP analyses (conducted during walk the talk or focus groups); a summary of responses from the employee feedback sheet (focus groups); and a summary of responses from management interview results (interviews). Other information may be included and/or substituted in the detailed supplement report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0215" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0215&rsqb;</number> After the completion of the above-described step, the facilitator then performs the implementation step (step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>). Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the implementation step includes the steps of communication (step <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>), action planning (step <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>), and assessment (step <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight>) based on the next steps template. The implementation is then carried out within a specified time period (step <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight>). A follow up assessment is conducted in some instances (step <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0216" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0216&rsqb;</number> The implementation step is preferably performed so that it results in creating a detailed 100-120 day plan that may maximize or enhances the following: comments that have been mentally noted by the facilitator while conducting the processes of embodiments of the present invention; plan(s) that the facilitator intends address in key action areas; identify tangible actions/behaviors/activities; and assessments of employee perceptions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0217" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0217&rsqb;</number> Examples of the key action areas may include the following: Breakdown of key processes; Career Development/Opportunities; Communications; Company Image; Consistency; Empowerment; Equipment; Feedback; Gain sharing; Health &amp; Safety; ISO Value; Lack of Rights; Leadership; Maintenance; Maximizing Customer Value; Pay/Benefits; PMI Fundamentals; Policies &amp; Procedures; Positive Direction; Recognition; Roles &amp; Responsibilities; Teamwork/Team building; Tools/Supplies; Training; Career Tracks; Values; We v. They; and Working Conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0218" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0218&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary next steps template that includes various steps to be performed during the implementation phase. An initial employee communication meeting <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> may take place soon after the completion of data collection. A formed reaction and opinion gathering step <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> can be on-going throughout the implementation phase (e.g., about 4 months). After 2-3 weeks, a senior management planning session <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight> can be held. After the senior management planning session, an all-employee meeting <highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight> may be held. Subsequent to the all-employee meeting <highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight>, a detailed action plan meeting <highlight><bold>1009</bold></highlight> may be devised. A second meeting <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> can be held. A goals and objectives assessment step <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> can be on-going. At the end of the implementation phase an assessment <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> can be made. The above sequence may be ordered differently and/or various steps modified, added and/or substituted. The following provides a more detailed exemplary description of the meetings and steps described above. Various alternatives or different combinations may also be utilized, and different sequences or orders of UTRS may be utilized. Further, one or more steps may be preferred in parallel with one another. </paragraph>

The plan may include information relating to the following items: a) specific actions that will be taken; b) time frames; c) who&apos;s responsible for completion; d) and resources needed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">7. Second All Employee Meeting <highlight><bold>1011</bold></highlight> </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0225" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0225&rsqb;</number> The facilitator may hold a second all employee meeting focusing on the action plan. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">8. Informal Reaction/Opinions </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0226" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0226&rsqb;</number> The facilitator takes every opportunity one-on-one conversations; staff meetings; and other employee forums to ask the members for their opinions. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">9. Goals &amp; Objectives <highlight><bold>1013</bold></highlight> </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0227" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0227&rsqb;</number> The facilitator may incorporate incorporating elements of the cultural assessment action plan into individuals objectives. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">10. Assessment <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0228" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0228&rsqb;</number> In this step, the facilitator conducts a simple assessment to measure if the members perceive any changes that have occurred in the Key Action Areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0229" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0229&rsqb;</number> Based on the above-described next steps template, the communications step (step <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight>) is preferably performed immediately after senior management receives the executive summary. The communication step may also include all employee meetings. These all hands meeting are to be held preferably at least two times: the first meeting may focus on &ldquo;what we heard&rdquo; and the focus of the second meeting is on &ldquo;what we will do.&rdquo; The communications step also include holding meetings directly with the supervisor team. It may also include holding monthly updates on status of the action plan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0230" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0230&rsqb;</number> The action planning step (step <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight>) includes the step of reviewing employee and consultant recommendations for each key action area with a client action planning team, and generating an additional list of unique suggestions from the client action planning team. The action planning step may also include the step of picking off all &ldquo;low hanging fruit&rdquo; (LHF). The LHF are preferably no cost to low cost and easy to complete actions/activities within a short period (e.g., the first 30 days) after the collection of the data. Such LHF can be identified and filled into an exemplary LHF table shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. Another step in the action planning step is to prioritize all remaining suggestions (employee/consultant/action planning team) using high, medium, or low rating. Furthermore, in this step, the facilitator may attempt to gain a consensus on all high rated suggestions making sure there is coverage in all identified key action areas. The facilitator then may complete a detailed implementation matrix for all consensus suggestions as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0231" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0231&rsqb;</number> In the assessment step (step <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight>), a variety of formal and informal assessments can be conducted throughout the processes of embodiments of the present invention to measure employee perceptions and adjust activities. These may include, for example: reaction to cultural assessment (what we heard); reaction to the action plan (what we plan to do); and reaction to monthly action plan updates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0232" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0232&rsqb;</number> During the implementation phase, an action plan (e.g., a 100-day plan) may be implemented. During the implementation phase, the facilitator may monitor and track the client action plan and deliver on promised actions in the agreed upon manner and time frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0233" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0233&rsqb;</number> In the follow up assessment step (steps <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight>), the facilitator may conduct short, formal assessment (written or online) regarding employee&apos;s perception of successful implementation of the client action plan. The facilitator may also provide a quantitative rating scale and solicit individual narrative feedback on all action plan items rated the same or worse since the process of embodiments of the present invention began. The results and significant trends identified thereby can be summarized by the facilitator. The implementation step described above in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> can be repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0234" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0234&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is an illustration of the architecture of the combined Internet, POTS (plain, old, telephone service), and ADSL (asymmetric, digital, subscriber line) for use in accordance with the principles of the present invention. For instance, the data gathered in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> can be entered at a remote location using the Internet to a server. Furthermore, it is to be understood that the use of the Internet, ADSL, and POTS are for exemplary reasons only and that any suitable communications network may be substituted without departing from the principles of the present invention. This particular example is briefly discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0235" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0235&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, to preserve POTS and to prevent a fault in the ADSL equipment <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> from compromising analog voice traffic <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> the voice part of the spectrum (the lowest 4 kHz) is separated from the rest by a passive filter, called a POTS splitter <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The rest of the available bandwidth&mdash;from about 10 kHz to 1 MHz&mdash;carries data at rates up to 6 bits per second for every hertz of bandwidth from data equipment <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight>. The ADSL equipment <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> then has access to a number of destinations including significantly the Internet <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> or other data communications networks, and other destinations <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0236" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0236&rsqb;</number> To exploit the higher frequencies, ADSL makes use of advanced modulation techniques, of which the best known is the discrete multitone (DMT) technology. As its name implies, ADSL transmits data asymmetrically&mdash;at different rates upstream toward the central office <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> and downstream toward the subscriber <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0237" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0237&rsqb;</number> Cable television providers are providing analogous Internet service to PC users over their TV cable systems by means of special cable modems. Such modems are capable of transmitting up to 30 Mb/s over hybrid fiber/coax system, which use fiber to bring signals to a location (e.g., a division of a corporation). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0238" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0238&rsqb;</number> Cable modems come in many forms. Most create a downstream data stream out of one of the 6-MHz TV channels that occupy spectrum above 50 MHz (and more likely 550 MHz) and carve an upstream channel out of the 5-50-MHz band, which is currently unused. Using 64-state quadrature amplitude modulation (64 QAM), a downstream channel can realistically transmit about 30 Mb/s (the oft-quoted lower speed of 10 Mb/s refers to PC rates associated with Ethernet connections). Upstream rates differ considerably from vendor to vendor, but good hybrid fiber/coax systems can deliver upstream speeds of a few megabits per second. Thus, like ADSL, cable modems transmit much more information downstream than upstream. Then Internet architecture <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and ADSL architecture <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> may also be combined with, for example, user networks <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0239" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0239&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the principles of the present invention, in one example, a main computing server implementing the process of the invention may be located on one or more computing nodes or terminals (e.g., on user networks <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> or system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>). Then, various users may interface with the main server via, for instance, the ADSL equipment discussed above, and access the information and processes of the present invention from remotely located PCs. As illustrated in this embodiment, users may access or use or interact with the computer assisted program in computer system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via various access methods. Databases <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are accessible via, for example computer system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and may be used in conjunction with client manager module <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>, tracking module <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, card readers <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, for the various functions described above. In another example, database <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> may contain collected data, and database <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may contain compiled data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0240" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0240&rsqb;</number> Viewed externally in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> computer system designated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>1440</bold></highlight> has a computer <highlight><bold>1442</bold></highlight> having disk drives <highlight><bold>1444</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1446</bold></highlight>. Disk drive indications <highlight><bold>1444</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1446</bold></highlight> are merely symbolic of a number of disk drives which might be accommodated by the computer system. Typically, these would include a floppy disk drive <highlight><bold>1444</bold></highlight>, a hard disk drive (not shown externally) and a CD ROM indicated by slot <highlight><bold>1446</bold></highlight>. The number and type of drives vary, typically with different computer configurations. Disk drives <highlight><bold>1444</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1446</bold></highlight> are in fact optional, and for space considerations, are easily omitted from the computer system used in conjunction with the production process/apparatus described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0241" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0241&rsqb;</number> The computer system also has an optional display upon which information screens may be displayed. In some situations, a keyboard <highlight><bold>1450</bold></highlight> and a mouse <highlight><bold>1452</bold></highlight> are provided as input devices through which a user&apos;s actions may be inputted, thus allowing input to interface with the central processing unit <highlight><bold>1442</bold></highlight>. Then again, for enhanced portability, the keyboard <highlight><bold>1450</bold></highlight> is either a limited function keyboard or omitted in its entirety. In addition, mouse <highlight><bold>1452</bold></highlight> optionally is a touch pad control device, or a track ball device, or even omitted in its entirety as well, and similarly may be used to input a user&apos;s selections.
