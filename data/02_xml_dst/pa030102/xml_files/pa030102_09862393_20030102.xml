<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) belongs to a family of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses called arteriviruses. Other viruses in this family are the prototype virus, equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) (de Vries et al., 1997 for review). Striking features common to the Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae have recently resulted in their placement in a newly created order, Nidovirales (Pringle, 1996; Cavanagh, 1997; de Vries et al., 1997). The four members of the Arterivirus group, while being similar in genome organization, replication strategy and amino acid sequence of the proteins are also similar in their preference for infection of macrophages, both in vivo and in vitro (Conzelmann et al., 1993; Meulenberg et al., 1993a). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A new viral disease of pigs was detected in North America in 1987 (Hill, 1990) and in Europe in 1990 (Paton et al. 1991). The disease, variously known as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), swine infertility and respiratory syndrome (SIRS), porcine epidemic abortion and respiratory syndrome (PEARS) and mystery swine disease is mainly characterized by reproductive failure in sows and respiratory problems in pigs of all ages. The causative agent, now known as PRRS virus, was first isolated in The Netherlands as Lelystad virus (Wensvoort et al., 1991). Subsequently, Benfield et al. (1992) and Collins et al. (1992) isolated a related virus in North America (prototype strain ATCC VR2332). Polyvalent antisera specific for European isolates of PRRSV cross-react with North American isolates in an immunoperoxidase assay on infected macrophages and vice versa (Wensvoort et al., 1992); however, further studies indicate that European and North American isolates represent two distinct genotypes that have evolved independently on separate continents (Mardassi et al., 1995: Meng et al., 1995a and b; Murtaugh et al., 1995; Nelsen et al., 1999). The near-simultaneous global emergence of a new swine disease caused by divergently evolved viruses suggests that changes in swine husbandry and management may have contributed to the emergence of PRRS (Nelsen et al., 1999). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the USA, 40 to 60% of herds are currently estimated to be infected (Bautista et al., 1993; Cho et al., 1993) while in Europe, PRRSV infection is believed to have affected greater than 50% of herds in some areas (Albina, 1997). It is difficult to gauge the economic effect of the disease, which varies from country to country. In the USA, losses of $500 per sow per year have been documented (Done and Paton, 1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Two main groups of clinical signs are associated with the occurrence of PRRS although it is now recognized that clinical effects vary greatly among infected herds and in many cases, infection is sub-clinical and productivity is within acceptable parameters. The two groups are: (1) Reproductive signs which include premature births, late-term abortions, piglets born weak and increased numbers of still-births and mummifications (Done and Paton, 1995); (2) Signs of respiratory disease in neonatal pigs which include labored breathing and coughing as the most dominant characteristics. The symptoms usually occur in pigs about three weeks of age though all ages are susceptible. In contrast to the reproductive failures, clinically overt respiratory disease is harder to reproduce experimentally (Zimmermann et al. 1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These clinical signs vary considerably and may be influenced by the virus strain (Halbur et al., 1995), age at infection and differences in genetic susceptibility (Halbur et al., 1992), concurrent infections (Galina et al., 1994), pig density, pig movements and housing systems (Done et al., 1996) and immune status including the presence of low levels of PRRS virus-specific antibodies which may be enhancing (Yoon et al., 1994). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In terms of pathogenesis, the most significant change induced by PRRSV is the severe damage to alveolar macrophages, which are destroyed in huge numbers (reviewed in Done and Paton, 1995; Rossow, 1998). The induction of apoptosis in a large number of mononuclear cells in the lungs and lymph nodes might be an explanation for a dramatic reduction in the number of alveolar macrophages and circulating lymphocytes and monocytes in PRRSV-infected pigs (Sirinarumitr et al., 1998; Sur et al., 1998). Coupled with the destruction of circulating lymphocytes and the destruction of the mucociliary clearance system, this may suppress immunity and render pigs more susceptible to secondary infection. An enhanced rate of bacterial secondary infections has been documented following PRRSV infection (Galina et al., 1994; Done and Paton, 1995; Nakamine et al. 1998). The severity of PRRSV infection may be also increased by bacterial or mycoplasma infection (Thacker et al. 1999). In addition a number of viral infections have been found associated with PRRS (Carlson, 1992; Brun et al., 1992; Halbur et al., 1993; Done et al., 1996; Heinen et al., 1998). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> There appear to be three routes of transmission: (1) nose to nose or close contact (Done et al., 1996), (2) aerosols (Le Potier et al., 1995), and (3) spread through urine, feces and semen. Transmission via insemination with contaminated semen is now well documented (Yeager et al., 1993; Albina, 1997). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The genome organization of arteriviruses is reviewed in de Vries et al. (1997). The genome RNA is single-stranded, infectious, polyadenylated and 5&prime; capped. The genome of PRRSV is small, at 15,088 bases. Both the EAV and LDV genomes are slightly smaller at 12,700 bases and 14,200 bases, respectively. Complete sequences of EAV, LDV and PRRSV genomes are available (Den Boon et al., 1991; Godeny et al., 1993; Meulenberg et al. 1993a). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The genome contains eight open reading frames (ORFs) that encode, in the following order, the replicase genes (ORFs <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the envelope proteins (ORFs 2 to 6) and the nucleocapsid protein (ORF 7) (Meulenberg et al. 1993a). ORFs 2 to 7 are expressed from six sub-genomic RNAs, which are synthesized during replication (Meng et al., 1994, 1996). These sub-genomic RNAs form a 3&prime; co-terminal nested set and are composed of a common leader, derived from the 5&prime; end of the viral genome (Meulenberg et al. 1993b). Although the RNAs are structurally polycistronic, translation is restricted to the unique 5&prime; sequences not present in the next smaller RNA of the set. Two large overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), designated ORF <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and ORF <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>take up more than two thirds of the genome. The second ORF, ORF <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is only expressed after a translational read-through via a &minus;1 frame shift mediated by a pseudoknot structure (Brierley 1995). The polypeptides encoded by these ORFs are proteolytically cleaved by virus-encoded proteases to yield the proteins involved in RNA synthesis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The current knowledge of the characteristics of the protein encoded by each ORF is summarized below. The amino acid homologies for ORFs 2 through 7 of the American PRRSV isolate VR-2332 as compared to the Lelystad virus, LDV and EAV have been described (Murtaugh, 1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> ORF 2 encodes a 29-30 kDa N-glycosylated structural protein (GP2 or GS) showing the features of a class 1 integral membrane glycoproteins (Meulenberg and Petersen-den Besten, 1996 using the Ter Huurne strain of Lelystad virus). The ORF 2 protein shows 63% amino acid homology when the American VR-2332 isolate is compared to Lelystad virus (Murtaugh et al., 1995). ORF 3 encodes an N-glycosylated 45-50 kDa minor structural protein designated GP3 (van Nieuwstadt et al., 1996). This is the least conserved ORF when comparing VR-2332 to Lelystad virus with only 58% amino acid identity between the two viruses (Murtaugh et al. 1995). Recent data indicated that GP3 is a non-structural glycoprotein that is released from the infected cells in a soluble form (Gonin et al., 1998). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> ORF 4 encodes a 31-35kDA minor N-glycosylated membrane protein designated GP4 (van Nieuwstadt et al., 1996). Monoclonal antibodies against GP4 are neutralizing indicating that at least part of the protein should be on the virion surface&mdash;the monoclonals are at least partially cross reactive with European isolates (van Nieuwstadt et al., 1996). The VR-2332 ORF 4 protein shows 68% amino acid identity when compared with Lelystad virus, and contains five putative membrane spanning domains (Murtaugh et al., 1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> ORF 5 encodes GP5 or GL, which is a 25 kDa major envelope glycoprotein (Meulenberg et al., 1995). The PRRS GP5 protein has been demonstrated to be an efficient inducer of apoptosis although the mechanism has not been determined (Suarez et al. 1996). When comparing the ORF 5 protein of PRRS Lelystad virus and the American VR-2332 isolate, 59% amino acid homology is found (Murtaugh et al. 1995). One region between residues 26 and 39 was found to correspond to a hypervariable region which involved 0 to 3 potential N-glycosylation sites (Pirzadeh et al., 1998b). The protein appears to be poorly immunogenic since it has been difficult to raise monoclonal antibodies against it by standard means (Pirzadeh and Dea, 1997; Drew et al., 1995). The protein is, however, recognized by most convalescent pig sera (Nelson et al., 1993; Meulenberg et al., 1995). Seroneutralization of PRRSV correlates with antibody response to the GP5 major envelope glycoprotein (Gonin et al., 1999). Monoclonal antibodies against GP5 have neutralizing activity which is usually specific for the parent virus only (Pirzadeh and Dea, 1997; Weiland et al., 1999). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> ORF 6 encodes an 18 kDA class III non-glycosylated integral membrane (M) protein (Meulenberg et al., 1995). Topographical studies with PRRSV, LDV and EAV have indicated that the ORF 5 (GL) protein and the ORF 6 M protein are present in the virion as heterodimers covalently linked by disulfide bonds (Mardassi et al. 1996; de Vries et al., 1995b; Faaberg et al., 1995). The bonds probably exist between cysteine residues in the ectodomains of the two proteins that are highly conserved in the equivalent proteins of PRRSV and EAV (Plagemann, 1996, Meulenberg et al., 1993a). In LDV it has been demonstrated that cleavage of the disulfide bond in virions results in loss of infectivity, perhaps indicating that the linkage of these two proteins may stabilize the virus attachment site for interaction with host cell receptor (Faaberg and Plagemann, 1995). The ORF 6 protein is the most conserved protein when comparing amino acid homologies between Lelystad virus and isolate VR-2332 with 78% homology (Murtaugh et al., 1995). Recent data suggest that the product of ORF 6 has a major role in cellular immunity (Bautista et al., 1999). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> ORF 7 encodes a 15 kDa non-glycosylated basic protein&mdash;thought to be the nucleocapsid protein (N) based on similarity of sequence to other nucleocapsid proteins. The ORF 7 protein of Lelystad virus has 65% amino acid identity between Lelystad virus and American isolate VR-2332 (Murtaugh et al., 1995). The N protein appears to be the most immunogenic PRRSV protein as antibody to N is the first to appear as detected by Western blot and is the most persistent (Nelson et al., 1994, Yoon et al., 1995). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A new open reading frame conserved in arteriviruses has been recently identified in the equine arteritis virus (EAV) genome (Snijder et al., 1999). This EAV ORF was designated <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and is coding for an essential 8kDa structural protein called &ldquo;E&rdquo;. In PRRSV, the homologous ORF has been designated <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the ORF 2 coding for GP2 (see above) being renamed ORF <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(Snijder et al., 1999). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is not yet clear what constitutes a protective immune response to PRRSV. In infected pigs, viremia can persist for many weeks in the face of circulating antibody and little is known about the mechanisms by which immunity develops. However, in herds where PRRSV persists, sows do not suffer repeated reproductive losses, indicating some form of protective immunity does develop (Done et al., 1996; Rossow et al., 1998). Neutralizing antibodies can decline quickly, as fast as 6 months after initial infection (Ohlinger et al. 1992) possibly indicating a short duration of active immunity. PRRSV can replicate in and spread from pigs with neutralizing antibodies, indicating that serum-neutralizing antibodies are not necessarily an essential part of the immune response (Ohlinger 1995). Exposure of swine to enzootic PRRSV will provide protection against homologous PRRSV-induced reproductive losses, but the extent and duration of protection against heterologous PRRSV may be variable and dependent on antigenic relatedness of the virus strains used for inoculation and challenge-exposure (Lager et al., 1999). Anti-PRRSV cellular immunity has been detected in infected pigs (Rossow. 1998). The proliferation T cell responses to the structural polypeptides of PRRSV have been recently analyzed using vaccinia recombinant viruses expressing structural polypeptides (ORFs 2 to 7; see below). The greater response was observed to the product of ORF 6 (Bautista et al., 1999). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Both killed and live attenuated virus vaccines are available. Plana Duran (1997) has described a killed oil-adjuvanted vaccine that induced 70% protection. In the USA, Gorcyca et al (1995) has described a live attenuated vaccine, which is administered as a single intramuscular injection. Although producing a detectable viremia, it was shown to be safe in late gestation sows, and was not transmitted to susceptible contact pigs. Field trials indicated there was significant benefit in use of the vaccine in nursery pigs in units with endemic PRRSV infection (Done et al., 1996). However, other studies indicated a lack of safety or efficacy of live attenuated vaccine if administered during gestation (Dewey et al., 1999; Mengeling et al., 1999b). Furthermore, in some swine herds, the vaccine strain may have persisted and mutated to a less attenuated form (Mengeling et al., 1999a). A recent study showed that some strains of PRRSV now circulating in US swine herds are more virulent than those encountered in the past. Clinical PRRS in vaccinated herds suggests need for a new generation of vaccines (Mengenling et al., 1998). Another recent study showed that European serotype PRRSV vaccine protects against European serotype challenge whereas an American serotype vaccine does not (van Woensel et al. 1998a and b). In summary, there is a need for new improved vaccines at both safety and efficacy levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Wensvoort, U.S. Pat. No. 5,620,691 or WO 92/21375 relates to &ldquo;Leylstad Agent&rdquo; as the &ldquo;causative agent of &ldquo;Mystery Swine Disease&rdquo;; and provides a deposit of this agent (I-1102, deposited Jun. 5, 1991 with the Institut Pasteur, Paris, France), and certains open reading frames of it. While Wensvoort may mention that the agent or parts of it could be incorporated in a vector system such as vaccinia virus, herpesvirus, pseudorabies virus, or adenovirus, there is no teaching or suggestion in Wensvoort of how to construct a recombinant vector system containing and expressing a PRRSV immunogen or epitope of interest, as in the present invention, and there is especially no teaching or suggestion of a recombinant avipox virus containing and expressing a PRRSV ORF, or the particular combinations of ORFs and/or recombinants of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Plana Duran et al. (1997) relates to the expression of ORFs 2 through 7 of a Spanish isolate of PRRSV in a baculovirus expression system. ORFs 3 through 7 were tested for immunogenicity in pregnant sows. Only vaccination with ORF 7 expressing the N protein gave a significant antibody response (immunoperoxidase monolayer assay). Immunization with ORF 7 gave no protection against challenge, however ORFs 3 and 5, alone or in combination, gave 50 to 70% protection against reproductive losses (Plana Duran et al. 1997). Piglets from mothers receiving ORFs 3 and 5 also demonstrated no anti-PRRSV antibody post-weaning after challenge indicating the absence of virus replication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Pirzadeh and Dea (1998) vaccinated pigs with a plasmid DNA expressing ORF 5. Induction of neutralizing antibodies, lymphocyte proliferation and protection against PRRSV challenge were observed. Similarly, Kwang et al. (1999) evaluated the immunogenicity of plasmid DNA encoding ORFs 4 to 7 in pigs. DNA immunization against PRRS virus results in the production of both humoral and cell mediated immune responses in 71 % and 86% immunized pigs, respectively. The results also indicate that neutralization epitopes for PRRS virus are present on the viral envelope glycoproteins encoded by ORF 4 and ORF 5. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Cochran, U.S. Pat. No. 6,033,904 or WO 96/22363 relates to recombinant swinepox virus and mentions PRRSV ORF 7; but, Cohcran fails to teach or suggest a recombinant vector system containing and expressing a PRRSV immunogen or epitope of interest, as in the present invention, and there is especially no teaching or suggestion of a recombinant avipox virus containing and expressing a PRRSV ORF, or the particular combinations of ORFs and/or recombinants of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Cochran, WO 00/03030 concerns recombinant raccoonpox virus and mentions PRRSV but, Cohcran fails to teach or suggest a recombinant vector system containing and expressing a PRRSV immunogen or epitope of interest, as in the present invention, and there is especially no teaching or suggestion of a recombinant avipox virus containing and expressing a PRRSV ORF, or the particular combinations of ORFs and/or recombinants of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Vaccinia virus has been used successfully to immunize against smallpox, culminating in the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1980. With the eradication of smallpox, a new role for poxviruses became important, that of a genetically engineered vector for the expression of foreign genes (Panicali and Paoletti, 1982; Paoletti et al., 1984). Genes encoding heterologous immunogens have been expressed in vaccinia, often resulting in protective immunity against challenge by the corresponding pathogen (reviewed in Tartaglia et al., 1990). A highly attenuated strain of vaccines, designated MVA, has also been used as a vector for poxvirus-based vaccines. Use of MVA is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,146. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Two additional vaccine vector systems involve the use of naturally host-restricted poxviruses, avipox viruses. Both fowlpoxvirus (FPV; Taylor et al. 1988a, b) and canarypoxvirus (CPV; Taylor et al., 1991 &amp; 1992) have been engineered to express foreign gene products. Fowlpox virus (FPV) is the prototypic virus of the Avipox genus of the Poxvirus family. The virus causes an economically important disease of poultry which has been well controlled since the 1920&apos;s by the use of live attenuated vaccines. Replication of the avipox viruses is limited to avian species (Matthews, 1982) and there are no reports in the literature of avipoxvirus causing a productive infection in any non-avian species including man. This host restriction provides an inherent safety barrier to transmission of the virus to other species and makes use of avipoxvirus based vaccine vectors in veterinary and human applications an attractive proposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> FPV has been used advantageously as a vector expressing immunogens from poultry pathogens. The hemagglutinin protein of a virulent avian influenza virus was expressed in an FPV recombinant (Taylor et al., 1988c). After inoculation of the recombinant into chickens and turkeys, an immune response was induced which was protective against either a homologous or a heterologous virulent influenza virus challenge (Taylor et al., 1988c). FPV recombinants expressing the surface glycoproteins of Newcastle Disease Virus have also been developed (Taylor et al., 1990; Edbauer et al., 1990). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Other attenuated poxvirus vectors have been prepared by genetic modifications of wild type strains of virus. The NYVAC vector, derived by deletion of specific virulence and host-range genes from the Copenhagen strain of vaccinia (Tartaglia et al., 1992), has proven useful as a recombinant vector in eliciting a protective immune response against an expressed foreign immunogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Another engineered poxvirus vector is ALVAC, derived from canarypox virus. ALVAC does not productively replicate in non-avian hosts, a characteristic thought to improve its safety profile (Taylor et al., 1991 &amp; 1992). Both ALVAC and NYVAC are BSL-1 vectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> One approach to the development of a subunit PRRSV vaccine is the use of live viral vectors to express relevant PRRSV ORFs. Recombinant poxviruses can be constructed in two steps known in the art and analogous to the methods for creating synthetic recombinants of poxviruses such as the vaccinia virus and avipox virus described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,769,330; 4,722,848; 4,603,112; 5,110,587; 5,174,993; 5,494,807; 5,942,235, and 5,505,941, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. It can thus be appreciated that provision of a PRRSV recombinant poxvirus, and of compositions and products therefrom particularly ALVAC based PRRSV recombinants and compositions and products therefrom, especially such recombinants expressing ORFs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 or any combination thereof of PRRSV, and compositions and products therefrom would be a highly desirable advance over the current state of technology. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present invention provides an immunological or vaccine composition or a therapeutic composition for inducing an immunological or protective response in a host animal inoculated with the composition. The composition includes a carrier or diluent or excipient and/or adjuvant, and a recombinant vector, such as a recombinant virus. The recombinant virus can be a modified recombinant virus; for instance, a recombinant of a virus that has inactivated therein (e.g., disrupted or deleted) virus-encoded genetic functions. A modified recombinant virus can have inactivated therein virus-encoded nonessential genetic functions; for instance, so that the recombinant virus has attenuated virulence and enhanced safety. The virus used in the composition according to the present invention is advantageously a poxvirus, such as a vaccinia virus or preferably an avipox virus, e.g., a fowlpox virus or more preferably a canarypox virus; and more advantageously, an ALVAC virus. It is advantageous that the recombinant vector or recombinant virus have expression without replication in mammalian species. The recombinant vector or modified recombinant virus can include, e.g., within the virus genome, such as within a non-essential region of the virus genome, a heterologous DNA sequence that encodes an immunogenic protein, e.g., derived from PRRSV ORF(s), e.g., PRRSV ORF 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 or any combination thereof, preferably PRRSV ORFs 3 and 5, or 5 and 6, or 4 and 5, or their combinations in particular 3 and 5 and 6, or 4 and 5 and 6. (wherein the immunogenic protein can be an epitope of interest, e.g., an epitope of interest from a protein expressed by any one or more of PRRSV ORF 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7, e.g., an epitope of interest from PRRSV ORFs 3 and 5, or 5 and 6, or 4 and 5, or their combinations in particular 3 and 5 and 6, or 4 and 5 and 6.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It is advantageous that the recombinant vector or recombinant virus contains and expresses PRRSV ORFs 3 and 5, or 5 and 6, or 4 and 5, or their combinations in particular 3 and 5 and 6, or 4 and 5 and 6. In another aspect, the invention provides the in vitro expression of these ORFs by a recombinant vector or recombinant virus. The expression product can then be isolated and employed in diagnostic or therapeutic or immunological or immunogenic or vaccine compositions, e.g., admixed with a suitable carrier, excipient, diluent and/or adjuvant. In a further aspect, the invention advantageously provides the in vivo expression of these ORFs and compositions comprising a recombinant vector or recombinant virus that contains and expresses these ORFs. Such compositions can contain the recombinant vector or recombinant virus and a suitable carrier, excipient, diluent and/or adjuvant. The invention further provides methods for obtaining a therapeutic, immunogenic, immunological and/or protective response comprising administering such a recombinant vector or recombinant virus that contains and expresses these ORFs and/or a composition comprising such a recombinant vector or recombinant virus and/or the in vitro expression products of these ORFs and/or a composition comprising such expression products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect, the present invention provides an immunogenic composition containing a recombinant vector such as a recombinant virus, e.g., a modified recombinant virus having inactivated (e.g., deleted or disrupted) virus-encoded genetic functions, such as nonessential virus-encoded genetic functions, so that the recombinant virus has attenuated virulence and enhanced safety. The modified recombinant virus includes, within the virus genome, e.g., within a non-essential region of the virus genome, a heterologous DNA sequence that encodes an immunogenic protein (e.g., derived from PRRSV ORFs, e.g., PRRSV ORF 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, preferably, PRRSV ORFs 3 and 5, or 5 and 6, or 4 and 5, or their combinations in particular 3 and 5 and 6, or 4 and 5 and 6.) wherein the composition, when administered to a host, is capable of inducing an immunological response specific to the immunogenic protein (for instance, wherein the immunogenic protein can be an epitope of interest, e.g., an epitope of interest from a protein expressed by any one or more of PRRSV ORF 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7, preferably PRRSV ORFs 3 and 5, or 5 and 6, or 4 and 5, or their combinations in particular 3 and 5 and 6, or 4 and 5 and 6.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In a still further aspect, the present invention provides a recombinant vector such as a recombinant virus. For example, the invention provides a modified recombinant virus; for instance, a recombinant virus modifed by having virus-encoded genetic functions inactivated (e.g., disrupted or deleted), such as a recombinant virus modified by having nonessential virus-encoded genetic functions inactivated therein, so that the virus has attenuated virulence; and, wherein the modified recombinant virus further contains DNA from a heterologous source in a the virus genome, such as in a nonessential region of the virus genome. The DNA can code for a PRRSV epitope of interest or can be PRRSV gene(s) or portion(s) thereof such as any or all of PRRSV ORF 2, ORF 3, ORF 4, ORF 5, ORF 6, ORF 7, e.g., PRRSV ORFs 2 and 3, or 3 and 4, or 3 and 5, or 3 and 5 and 6, or 4 and 5 and 6, or 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 expressed by any one or more of these ORFs or combinations of ORFs. In particular, the genetic functions can be inactivated by deleting an open reading frame encoding a virulence factor or by utilizing naturally host-restricted viruses and/or by utilizing attenuated and naturally-host restricted viruses. The virus used according to the present invention is advantageously a poxvirus, such as a vaccinia virus or preferably an avipox virus, e.g., a fowlpox virus or more preferably a canarypox virus. Advantageously, the open reading frame, with respect to vaccinia, is selected from the group consisting of J2R, B13R&plus;B14R, A26L, A56R, C7L&minus;K1L, I4L, combinations thereof (by the terminology reported in Goebel et al., 1990); and advantageously, the combination thereof comprising J2R, B13R&plus;B14R, A26L, A56R, C7L&minus;K1L, and I4L. In this respect, the open reading frame comprises a thymidine kinase gene, a hemorrhagic region, an A type inclusion body region, a hemagglutinin gene, a host range gene region or a large subunit, ribonucleotide reductase; or, the combination thereof. A suitable modified Copenhagen strain of vaccinia virus is identified as NYVAC (Tartaglia et al., 1992), or a vaccinia virus from which has been deleted J2R, B13R&plus;B14R, A26L, A56R, C7L-K11 and 14L or a thymidine kinase gene, a hemorrhagic region, an A type inclusion body region, a hemagglutinin gene, a host range region, and a large subunit, ribonucleotide reductase (See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,364,773, 5,494,807 and 5,762,938 with respect to NYVAC and vectors having additional deletions or inactivations than those of NYVAC that are useful in the practice of this invention). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the poxvirus vector is an ALVAC or, a canarypox virus which was attenuated, for instance, through more than 200 serial passages on chick embryo fibroblasts (Rentschler vaccine strain), a master seed therefrom was subjected to four successive plaque purifications under agar from which a plaque clone was amplified through five additional passages (See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,756,103 and 5,766,599 with respect to ALVAC and TROVAC (an attenuated fowlpox virus useful in the practice of this invention); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,004,777 and 5,990,091 and U.S. applications Ser. Nos. 60/151,564, 60/138,352 and 60/138,478, respectively filed Aug. 31, 1999, Jun. 10, 1999, and Jun. 10, 1999, with respect to vectors, such as vectors having enhanced expression and/or vectors useful with respect to porcine hosts (for instance, vectors useful with porcine hosts can include pig herpes viruses, including Aujeszky&apos;s disease virus, an adenovirus including a porcine adenovirus, a poxvirus, including a vaccinia virus, an avipox virus, a canarypox virus, a raccoonpox virus and a swinepox virus; see, e.g, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,033,904, 5,869,312, and 5,382,425 with respect to swinepox), that also can be used in the practice of this invention, as well as with respect to terms used and teachings herein such as &ldquo;immunogenic composition&rdquo;, &ldquo;immunological composition&rdquo;, &ldquo;vaccine&rdquo;, and &ldquo;epitope of interest&rdquo;, and dosages, routes of administration, formulations, adjuvants, and uses for recombinant viruses and expression products therefrom). It is desirable that the recombinant vector or recombinant virus have expression without productive replication in the host. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As to epitopes of interest, reference is made to Kendrew, THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (Blackwell Science Ltd., 1995) and Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1982. An epitope of interest is an immunologically relevant region of an immunogen or immunologically active fragment thereof, e.g., from a pathogen or toxin of veterinary or human interest, e.g., PRRSV. One skilled in the art can determine an epitope or immunodominant region of a peptide or polypeptide and ergo the coding DNA therefor from the knowledge of the amino acid and corresponding DNA sequences of the peptide or polypeptide, as well as from the nature of particular amino acids (e.g., size, charge, etc.) and the codon dictionary, without undue experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The DNA sequence preferably encodes at least regions of the peptide that generate an antibody response or a T cell response. One method to determine T and B cell epitopes involves epitope mapping. The protein of interest is synthetized in short overlapping peptides (PEPSCAN). The individual peptides are then tested for their ability to bind to an antibody elicited by the native protein or to induce T cell or B cell activation. Janis Kuby, Immunology, (1992) pp.79-80. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Another method for determining an epitope of interest is to choose the regions of the protein that are hydrophilic. Hydrophilic residues are often on the surface of the protein and are therefore often the regions of the protein which are accessible to the antibody. Janis Kuby, Immunology, (1992) p. 81 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Still another method for choosing an epitope of interest which can generate a T cell response is to identify from the protein sequence potential HLA anchor binding motifs which are peptide sequences which are known to be likely to bind to the MHC molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The peptide which is a putative epitope of interest, to generate a T cell response, should be presented in a MHC complex. The peptide preferably contains appropriate anchor motifs for binding to the MHC molecules, and should bind with high enough affinity to generate an immune response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Some guidelines in determining whether a protein is an epitopes of interest which will stimulate a T cell response, include: Peptide length&mdash;the peptide should be at least 8 or 9 amino acids long to fit into the MHC class I complex and at least 13-25 amino acids long to fit into a class II MHC complex. This length is a minimum for the peptide to bind to the MHC complex. It is preferred for the peptides to be longer than these lengths because cells may cut the expressed peptides. The peptide should contain an appropriate anchor motif which will enable it to bind to the various class I or class II molecules with high enough specificity to generate an immune response (See Bocchia, M. et al, Specific Binding of Leukemia Oncogene Fusion Protein Peptides to HLA Class I Molecules, Blood 85:2680-2684; Englehard, VH, Structure of peptides associated with class I and class II MHC molecules Ann. Rev. Immunol. 12:181 (1994)). This can be done, without undue experimentation, by comparing the sequence of the protein of interest with published structures of peptides associated with the MHC molecules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Further, the skilled artisan can ascertain an epitope of interest by comparing the protein sequence with sequences listed in the protein data base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Even further, another method is simply to generate or express portions of a protein of interest, generate monoclonal antibodies to those portions of the protein of interest, and then ascertain whether those antibodies inhibit growth in vitro of the pathogen from which the from which the protein was derived. The skilled artisan can use the other guidelines set forth in this disclosure and in the art for generating or expressing portions of a protein of interest for analysis as to whether antibodies thereto inhibit growth in vitro. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As to &ldquo;immunogenic composition&rdquo;, &ldquo;immunological composition&rdquo; and &ldquo;vaccine&rdquo;, an immunological composition containing the vector (or an expression product thereof) elicits an immunological response&mdash;local or systemic. The response can, but need not be protective. An immunogenic composition containing the inventive recombinant or vector (or an expression product thereof) likewise elicits a local or systemic immunological response which can, but need not be, protective. A vaccine composition elicits a local or systemic protective response. Accordingly, the terms &ldquo;immunological composition&rdquo; and &ldquo;immunogenic composition&rdquo; include a &ldquo;vaccine composition&rdquo; (as the two former terms can be protective compositions). The invention comprehends immunological, immunogenic or vaccine compositions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> With respect to dosages, routes of administration, formulations, adjuvants, and uses for recombinant viruses and expression products therefrom, compositions of the invention may be used for parenteral or mucosal administration, preferably by intradermal, subcutaneous or intramuscular routes. When mucosal administration is used, it is possible to use oral, ocular or nasal routes. The invention in yet a further aspect relates to the product of expression of the inventive recombinant or vector, e.g., virus, for instance, recombinant poxvirus, and uses therefor, such as to form an immunological or vaccine compositions for treatment, prevention, diagnosis or testing; and, to DNA from the recombinant or inventive virus, e.g., poxvirus, which is useful in constructing DNA probes and PCR primers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In one aspect, the present invention provides a recombinant vector, e.g., virus such as a recombinant poxvirus containing therein a DNA sequence from PRRSV, e.g., in the virus (such as poxvirus) genome, advantageously a non-essential region of the virus, e.g., poxvirus genome. The poxvirus can be a vaccinia virus such as a NYVAC or NYVAC-based virus; and, the poxvirus is advantageously an avipox virus, such as fowlpox virus, especially an attenuated fowlpox virus, e.g., TROVAC, or a canarypox virus, preferably an attenuated canarypox virus, such as ALVAC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the recombinant vector, e.g., virus such as poxvirus, expresses gene products of the foreign PRRSV gene(s) or nucleic acid molecule(s). Specific ORF(s) of PRRSV or specific nucleic acid molecules encoding epitope(s) from specific PRRSV ORF(s) is/are inserted into the recombinant vector e.g., virus such as poxvirus vector, and the resulting vector, e.g., recombinant virus such as poxvirus, is used to infect an animal or express the product(s) in vitro for administration to the animal. Expression in the animal of PRRSV gene products results in an immune response in the animal to PRRSV. Thus, the recombinant vector, e.g., virus such as recombinant poxvirus of the present invention may be used in an immunological composition or vaccine to provide a means to induce an immune response. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The administration procedure for a recombinant vector, e.g., recombinant virus such as recombinant poxvirus-PRRSV or expression product thereof, as well as for compositions of the invention such as immunological or vaccine compositions or therapeutic compositions (e.g., compositions containing the recombinant vector or recombinant virus such as poxvirus or the expression product therefrom), can be via a parenteral route (intradermal, intramuscular or subcutaneous). Such an administration enables a systemic immune response, or humoral or cell-mediated responses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The vector or recombinant virus-PRRSV, e.g., poxvirus-PRRSV, or expression product thereof, or composition containing such an expression product and/or vector or virus, can be administered to pigs of any age or sex; for instance, to elicit an immunological response against PRRSV, e.g., to thereby prevent PRRSV and/or other pathologic sequelae associated with PRRSV. Advantageously, the vector or recombinant virus-PRRSV, e.g., poxvirus-PRRSV, or expression product thereof, or composition containing such an expression product and/or vector or virus, is administered to a piglet or very young pig, including a newborn and/or to a pregnant sow to confer active immunity during gestation and/or passive immunity to the newborn through maternal antibodies. In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides for inoculation of a female pig (e.g., sow, gilt) with a composition comprising an immunogen from PRRSV or an epitope of interest from such an immunogen, e.g., an immunogen from PRRSV ORF 2, ORF 3, ORF 4, ORF 5, ORF 6, and/or ORF 7, for instance, an immunogen from PRRSV ORFs 3 and 5, or 5 and 6, or 4 and 5, or their combinations in particular 3 and 5 and 6, or 4 and 5 and 6 and/or an epitope of interest expressed by any one or more of these ORFs or combinations of ORFs, and/or with a vector expressing such an immunogen or epitope of interest. The inoculation can be prior to breeding; and/or prior to serving; and/or during gestation (or pregnancy), and/or prior to the perinatal period or farrowing; and/or repeatedly over a lifetime. Advantageously, at least one inoculation is done before serving. It is also advantageously followed by an inoculation to be performed during gestation, e.g., at about mid-gestation (at about 6-8 weeks of gestation) and/or at the end of gestation (or at about 11-13 weeks of gestation). Thus, an advantageous regimen is an inoculation before serving and a booster inoculation during gestation. Thereafter, there can be reinoculation before each serving and/or during gestation at about mid-gestation (at about 6-8 weeks of gestation) and/or at the end of gestation (or at about 11-13 weeks of gestation). Preferably, reinoculation can be during gestation only. In another preferred embodiment, piglets, such as piglets from vaccinated females (e.g., inoculated as herein discussed), are inoculated within the first weeks of life, e.g., inoculation at one and/or two and/or three and/or four and/or five weeks of life. More preferably, piglets are first inoculated within the first week of life or within the third week of life (e.g., at the time of weaning). Even more advantageous, such piglets are then boosted two (2) to four (4) weeks later (after being first inoculated). Thus, both offspring, as well as female pig (e.g., sow, gilt) can be administered compositions of the invention and/or can be the subject of performance of methods of the invention. Inoculations can be in the doses as herein described. With respect to the administration of poxvirus or virus compositions and maternal immunity, reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,338,683. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The inventive recombinant vector or virus-PRRSV (e.g., poxvirus-PRRSV recombinants) immunological or vaccine compositions or therapeutic compositions, can be prepared in accordance with standard techniques well known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical or veterinary art. Such compositions can be administered in dosages and by techniques well known to those skilled in the veterinary arts taking into consideration such factors as the age, sex, weight, and the route of administration. The compositions can be administered alone, or can be co-administered or sequentially administered with compositions, e.g., with &ldquo;other&rdquo; immunological composition, or attenuated, inactivated, recombinant vaccine or therapeutic compositions thereby providing multivalent or &ldquo;cocktail&rdquo; or combination compositions of the invention and methods employing them. The composition may contain combinations of the PRRSV component (e.g., recombinant vector such as a plasmid or virus or poxvirus expressing a PRRSV immunogen or epitope of interest and/or PRRSV immunogen or epitope of interest) and one or more unrelated porcine pathogen vaccines (e.g., epitope(s) of interest, immunogen(s) and/or recombinant vector or virus such as a recombinant virus, e.g., recombinant poxvirus expressing such epitope(s) or immunogen(s)) such as one or more immunogen or epitope of interest from one or more porcine bacterial and/or viral pathogen(s), e.g., an epitope of interest or immunogen from one or more of: porcine circovirus, porcine parvovirus, porcine influenza virus, pseudorabies virus, <highlight><italic>E. coli</italic></highlight>, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Actinobacillus pneumoniae, hog cholera virus, and the like. Again, the ingredients and manner (sequential or co-administration) of administration, as well as dosages can be determined taking into consideration such factors as the age, sex, weight, and, the route of administration. In this regard, reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,456, incorporated herein by reference, and directed to rabies compositions and combination compositions and uses thereof; see also other documents cited herein and documents cited or referenced in herein cited documents, including U.S. application Ser. No. 60/151,564; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,217,883. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Examples of compositions of the invention include liquid preparations for mucosal administration, e.g., oral, nasal, ocular, etc., administration such as suspensions and, preparations for parenteral, subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular (e.g., injectable administration) such as sterile suspensions or emulsions. In such compositions the recombinant poxvirus or immunogens may be in admixture with a suitable carrier, diluent, or excipient such as sterile water, physiological saline, or the like. The compositions can also be lyophilized or frozen. The compositions can contain auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, adjuvants, preservatives, and the like, depending upon the route of administration and the preparation desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The compositions can contain at least one adjuvant compound chosen from the polymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid and the copolymers of maleic anhydride and alkenyl derivative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The preferred adjuvant compounds are the polymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid which are cross-linked, especially with polyalkenyl ethers of sugars or polyalcohols. These compounds are known by the term carbomer (Phameuropa Vol. 8, No. 2, June 1996). Persons skilled in the art can also refer to U.S. Pat. No. 2,909,462 (incorporated herein by reference) which describes such acrylic polymers cross-linked with a polyhydroxylated compound having at least 3 hydroxyl groups, preferably not more than 8, the hydrogen atoms of at least three hydroxyls being replaced by unsaturated aliphatic radicals having at least 2 carbon atoms. The preferred radicals are those containing from 2 to 4 carbon atoms, e.g. vinyls, allyls and other ethylenically unsaturated groups. The unsaturated radicals may themselves contain other substituents, such as methyl. The products sold under the name Carbopol&reg; (BF Goodrich, Ohio, USA) are particularly appropriate. They are cross-linked with allyl sucrose or with allyl pentaerythritol. Among them, there may be mentioned Carbopol&reg; 974P, 934P and 971 P. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Among the copolymers of maleic anhydride and alkenyl derivative, the copolymers EMA&reg; (Monsanto) which are copolymers of maleic anhydride and ethylene, linear or cross-linked, for example cross-linked with divinyl ether, are preferred. Reference may be made to J. Fields et al., Nature, 186:778-780, Jun. 4, 1960, incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> From the point of view of their structure, the polymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid and the copolymers EMA&reg; are preferably formed of basic units of the following formula:

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The dissolution of these polymers in water leads to an acid solution which will be neutralized, preferably to physiological pH, in order to give the adjuvant solution into which the vaccine itself will be incorporated. The carboxyl groups of the polymer are then partly in COO<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a solution of adjuvant according to the invention, especially of carbomer, is prepared in distilled water, preferably in the presence of sodium chloride, the solution obtained being at acidic pH. This stock solution is diluted by adding it to the desired quantity (for obtaining the desired final concentration), or a substantial part thereof, of water charged with NaCl, preferably physiological saline (NaCL 9 g/l) all at once in several portions with concomitant or subsequent neutralization (pH 7.3 to 7.4), preferably with NaOH. This solution at physiological pH will be used as it is for mixing with the vaccine, which may be especially stored in freeze-dried, liquid or frozen form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The polymer concentration in the final vaccine composition will be 0.01% to 2% w/v, more particularly 0.06 to 1% w/v, preferably 0.1 to 0.6% w/v. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The compositions of the invention can also be formulated as oil in water or as water in oil in water emulsions, e.g. as in V. Ganne et al. Vaccine 1994, 12, 1190-1196. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Standard texts, such as &ldquo;REMINGTON&apos;S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE&rdquo;, 17th edition, 1985, incorporated herein by reference, may be consulted to prepare suitable preparations, without undue experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Compositions in forms for various administration routes are envisioned by the invention. And again, the effective dosage and route of administration are determined by known factors, such as age, sex, weight, and other screening procedures which are known and do not require undue experimentation. Dosages of each active agent can be as in herein cited documents (or documents referenced or cited in herein cited documents) and/or can range from one or a few to a few hundred or thousand micrograms, e.g., 1 &mgr;g to 1 mg, for a subunit immunogenic, immunological or vaccine composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Recombinant vectors can be administered in a suitable amount to obtain in vivo expression corresponding to the dosages described herein and/or in herein cited documents. For instance, suitable ranges for viral suspensions can be determined empirically. The viral vector or recombinant in the invention can be administered to a pig or infected or transfected into cells in an amount of about at least 10<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>pfu; more preferably about 10<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>pfu to about 10<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>pfu, e.g., about 10<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>pfu to about 10<highlight><superscript>9 </superscript></highlight>pfu, for instance about 10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>pfu to about 10<highlight><superscript>8 </superscript></highlight>pfu, per dose, for example, per 2 ml dose. And, if more than one gene product is expressed by more than one recombinant, each recombinant can be administered in these amounts; or, each recombinant can be administered such that there is, in combination, a sum of recombinants comprising these amounts. In recombinant vector compositions employed in the invention, dosages can be as described in documents cited herein or as described herein or as in documents referenced or cited in herein cited documents. For instance, suitable quantities of each DNA in recombinant vector compositions can be 1 &mgr;g to 2 mg, preferably 50 &mgr;g to 1 mg. Documents cited herein (or documents cited or referenced in herein cited documents) regarding DNA vectors may be consulted by the skilled artisan to ascertain other suitable dosages for recombinant DNA vector compositions of the invention, without undue experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> However, the dosage of the composition(s), concentration of components therein and timing of administering the composition(s), which elicit a suitable immunological response, can be determined by methods such as by antibody titrations of sera, e.g., by ELISA and/or seroneutralization assay analysis and/or by vaccination challenge evaluation in pig. Such determinations do not require undue experimentation from the knowledge of the skilled artisan, this disclosure and the documents cited herein. And, the time for sequential administrations can be likewise ascertained with methods ascertainable from this disclosure, and the knowledge in the art, without undue experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The PRRSV immunogen or epitope of interest can be obtained from PRRSV or can be obtained from in vitro recombinant expression of PRRSV gene(s) or portions thereof. Methods for making and/or using vectors (or recombinants) for expression and uses of expression products and products therefrom (such as antibodies) can be by or analogous to the methods disclosed in herein cited documents and documents referenced or cited in herein cited documents. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The invention in a particular aspect is directed to recombinant poxviruses containing therein a DNA sequence from PRRSV, advantageously in a nonessential region of the poxvirus genome. The recombinant poxviruses express gene products of the foreign PRRSV gene. In particular, ORF 2, ORF 3, ORF 4, ORF 5, ORF 6, and ORF 7 genes encoding PRRSV proteins were isolated, characterized and inserted into ALVAC (canarypox vector) recombinants. Advantageously, the ALVAC canarypox vector contains and expresses PRRSV ORFs 3 and 5, or 5 and 6, or 4 and 5, or their combinations in particular 3 and 5 and 6, or 4 and 5 and 6. The molecular biology techniques used are the ones described by Sambrook et al. (1989). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The parental canarypox virus (Rentschler strain) is a vaccinal strain for canaries. The vaccine strain was obtained from a wild type isolate and attenuated through more than 200 serial passages on chick embryo fibroblasts. A master viral seed was subjected to four successive plaque purifications under agar and one plaque clone was amplified through five additional passages after which the stock virus was used as the parental virus in in vitro recombination tests. The plaque purified canarypox isolate is designated ALVAC. ALVAC was deposited Nov. 14, 1996 under the terms of the Budapest Treaty at the American Type Culture Collection, ATCC accession number VR-2547; see also documents cited herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The generation of poxvirus recombinants can involve different steps: (1) construction of an insertion plasmid containing sequences (&ldquo;arms&rdquo;) flanking the insertion locus within the poxvirus genome, and multiple cloning site (MCS) localized between the two flanking arms (e.g., see example 1); (2) construction of donor plasmids consisting of an insertion plasmid into the MCS of which a foreign gene expression cassette has been inserted (e.g. see examples 2 and 3); (3) in vitro recombination in cell culture between the arms of the donor plasmid and the genome of the parental poxvirus allowing the insertion of the foreign gene expression cassette into the appropriate locus of the poxvirus genome, and plaque purification of the recombinant virus (e.g. see example 10). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Construction of Canarypox Insertion Plasmid at C6 Locus </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (SEQ ID NO: 1) is the sequence of a 3.7 kb segment of canarypox DNA. Analysis of the sequence revealed an ORF designated C6L initiated at position 377 and terminated at position 2254. The following describes a C6 insertion plasmid constructed by deleting the C6 ORF and replacing it with a multiple cloning site (MCS) flanked by transcriptional and translational termination signals. A 380 bp PCR fragment is amplified from genomic canarypox DNA using oligonucleotide primers C6A1 (SEQ ID NO: 2) and C6B1 (SEQ ID NO: 3). A 1155 bp PCR fragment is amplified from genomic canarypox DNA using oligonucleotide primers C6C1 (SEQ ID NO: 4) and C6D1 (SEQ ID NO: 5). The 380 bp and 1155 bp fragments are fused together by adding them together as template and amplifying a 1613 bp PCR fragment using oligonucleotide primers C6A1 (SEQ ID NO: 2) and C6D1 (SEQ ID NO: 5). This fragment is digested with SacI and KpnI, and ligated into pBluescript SK&plus; digested with SacI/KpnI. The resulting plasmid, pC6L is confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. It consists of 370 bp of canarypox DNA upstream of C6 (&ldquo;C6 left arm&rdquo;), vaccinia early termination signal, translation stop codons in six reading frames, an MCS containing SmaI, PstI, XhoI and EcoRI sites, vaccinia early termination signal, translation stop codons in six reading frames and 1156 bp of downstream canary pox sequence (&ldquo;C6 right arm&rdquo;). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Plasmid pJP099 is derived from pC6L by ligating a cassette containing the vaccinia H6 promoter (described in Taylor et al. (1988c), Guo et al. (1989), and Perkus et al. (1989)) coupled to a foreign gene into the SmaIEcoRI sites of pC6L. This plasmid pJPO99 contains a unique EcoRV site and a unique NruI site located at the 3&prime; end of the H6 promoter, and a unique SalI and PspAI site located between the STOP codon of the foreign gene and the C6 left arm. The &tilde;4.5 kb EcoRVI/SalI or EcoRV/PspAI fragment from pJP099 contains therefore the plasmid sequence (pBluescript SK&plus;; Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif., USA), the 2 C6 arms and the 5&prime; end of the H6 promoter until the EcoRV. Plasmid pJP105 is a derivative of pJP099 containing a different foreign gene inserted into pC6L. The &tilde;4.5 kb EcoRV/SalI fragment from pJP105 is identical to that of pJP099 described above. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The PRRSV ORF 3 sequence from the clone pPB356.6A (see example 3) contains a T5NT at position 334-340, which is known to be an early transcription termination signal in poxvirus, and therefore, needs to be silently mutated. ORF 3 is amplified by PCR using primers JP804 (SEQ ID NO: 11; contains the 3&prime; end of the H6 promoter (from the EcoRV site) and the 5&prime; end of PRRS ORF3) and JP805 (SEQ ID NO: 12; contains the 3&prime; end of PRRS ORF3 and a SalI cloning site) on plasmid pPB356.6A to generate a &tilde;820 bp fragment designated PCR J1317A. PCR J1317A is digested with EcoRV/SalI and cloned into a &tilde;4.5 kb EcoRV/SalI fragment from pJP105 (see example 1). The ORF 3 sequence of two clones of the resulting plasmid, designated 8S20 and 8S19 is sequenced.

PCR J1319 is digested with EcorV/BspEI and ligated into EcoRV/BspEI digested 8S20.

Reaction mixture is successively incubated at 42&deg; C. for 15 min, 99&deg; C. for 5 min and 4&deg; C. for 5 min. The single strand cDNA is sub PCR-amplified in a 100 &mgr;l final volume consisting of the 20 &mgr;l RT-PCR reaction and 80 &mgr;l of PCR MasterMix (2 mM MgCl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, PCR bufferII 1&times; and 2.5 U Ampli Taq&reg; DNA Polymerase) including oligonucleotide primers PB462 (SEQ ID NO: 21) and PB43 (SEQ ID NO: 20).

The PCR fragment containing the PRRSV ORF 5 coding sequence is purified by Geneclean (GENECLEAN Kit; BIO101 Vista, Calif., U.S.A.) and subsequently digested with SalI and BamHI to generate a SalI-BamHI fragment of 642bp. This fragment is cloned into the vector pVR1012 (VICAL Inc., San Diego, Calif., U.S.A.) digested with SalI and BamHI to generate plasmid pPB273. The PCR fragment is cloned into the vector pCRII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., U.S.A.) to generated plasmid pPB267. Plasmid pPB273 is digested with SalI and ClaI to generate a SalI-ClaI fragment of 487bp (fragment A). Plasmid 267 is digested with ClaI and BamHI to generate a ClaI-BamHI fragment of 161bp (fragment B). Fragments A and B are ligated into vector pVRO12 (VICAL Inc., San Diego, Calif., U.S.A.) digested with SalI and BamHI to generate plasmid pPB270 which contains the PRRSV ORF 5. The ORF 5 present in three independent clones are sequenced in their entirety and a consensus sequence is established and found to be 100% homologous to the sequence of reference (PRRSV Lelystad strain, Genebank accession number M96262). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> The sequence analysis of PRRS ORF 5 shows the presence of two T5NT at positions 59-65 and 264-270, which are known to be early transcription termination signals in poxvirus. In order to silently mutate these two T5NT encoded within ORF 5, the following strategy is employed. To mutate the T5NT (positions 59-65), primers JP764 (SEQ ID NO: 22; primer 764 contains the 3&prime; end of the H6 promoter and the first 71 bases of the 5&prime; end of the PRRS ORF 5 including the desired T5NT change) and JP776 (SEQ ID NO: 23; primer JP776 contains the 3&prime; end of PRRS ORF 5 and a PspAI cloning site) are used on plasmid pPB270 to generate &tilde;627bp PCR J1307, which is cloned into pCR2.1 plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The resulting plasmid is designated pJP106. A &tilde;627bp EcoRV/PspAI fragment, containing PRRS ORF 5, is isolated from plasmid pJP106, and cloned into a &tilde;4.5Kb EcoRV/PspAI fragment from pJP099 (see example 1) to create a new plasmid designated pJP108. To mutate the T5NT (positions 264-270), a &tilde;345bp fragment designated PCR J1314 is generated using primers JP766 (SEQ ID NO: 24; primer JP766 contains 20 bases of the H6 promoter) and JP767 (SEQ ID NO: 25; primer JP767 contains PRRS ORF 5 sequences including the desired T5NT change) on plasmid pJP108. PCR J 1314 is digested with EcoRV/SnaBI and cloned into a &tilde;4.9Kb EcoRV/SnaBI fragment from pJP108. The resulting donor plasmid, designated pJP110, is confirmed by sequence analysis to contain PRRS ORF 5 with the desired T5NT mutagenesis (T to C changes at positions 63 and 267 of the ORF), which do not effect the amino acid sequence of the gene (see the map in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> and the sequence (SEQ ID NO: 26) in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>). This donor plasmid pJP110 (linearized with NotI) is used in an in vitro recombination (IVR) assay to generate ALVAC recombinant vCP1619 (see example 10). </paragraph>

Positive plaques are selected on the basis of hybridization to specific PRRSV radiolabeled probes and subjected to four sequential rounds of plaque purification until a pure population is achieved. One representative plaque from each IVR is then amplified and the resulting ALVAC recombinants are designated vCP1642 (ORF2), vCP1643, (ORF 3), vCP1618 (ORF 4), vCP 1619 (ORF 5), and vCP 1626 (ORF 5 and ORF 6). Table 1 indicates the name of the donor plasmids, ALVAC recombinants and expressed PRRS ORFs. All these recombinants are the result of recombination events between the ALVAC vector and the donor plasmids, and they contain PRRSV ORF(s) inserted into the ALVAC C6 locus. The genomic structure is determined for all recombinants by restriction analysis and Southern blotting using different probes.

<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> Formulation of Recombinant Canarypox Viruses with Carbopol&trade; 974P </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> For the preparation of vaccines, recombinant canarypox viruses (example 10) can be mixed with solutions of carbomer. The carbomer component used for vaccination of pigs according to the present invention is the Carbopol&trade; 974P manufactured by the company BF Goodrich (molecular weight of 3,000,000). A 1.5 % Carbopol&trade; 974P stock solution is first prepared in distilled water containing 1 g/l of sodium chloride. This stock solution is then used for manufacturing a 4 mg/ml Carbopol&trade; 974P solution in physiological water. The stock solution is mixed with the required volume of physiological water, either in one step or in several successive steps, adjusting the pH value at each step with a IN (or more concentrated) sodium hydroxide solution to get a final pH value of 7.3-7.4. This final Carbopol&trade; 974P solution is a ready-to-use solution for reconstituting a lyophilized recombinant virus or for diluting a concentrated recombinant virus stock. For example, to get a final viral suspension containing 10<highlight><superscript>e</superscript></highlight>8 pfu per dose of 2 ml, one can dilute 0.1 ml of a 10<highlight><superscript>e</superscript></highlight>9 pfu/ml viral stock solution into 1.9 ml of the above Carbopol&trade; 974P 4 mg/ml ready-to-use solution. The same calculation applies in the case of mixtures of recombinant viruses, by taking into account the final pfu/ml titers that need to be achieved. In the same fashion, Carbopol&trade; 974P 2 mg/ml ready-to-use solutions can also be prepared. </paragraph>
