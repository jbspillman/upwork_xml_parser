<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns &bgr;-glucuronidase (GUS) proteins, DNA encoding the same, and methods of use thereof. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> &bgr;-Glucuronidase protein (GUS) and the gene encoding this protein (gusA) are widely used as reporter genes and proteins in molecular biology. Bacterial &bgr;-glucuronidase activity has been considered for many years to be almost unique to <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>and closely related Enterobacteriaceae (Wilson et al. (1992) The <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli </italic></highlight>gus operon: induction and expression of the gus operon in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and the occurrence and use of GUS in other bacteria. In. S. R. Gallagher (ed.), GUS Protocols: using the GUS gene as a reporter of gene expression. Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.). However, evidence has slowly been accumulating to indicate that &bgr;-glucuronidase activity can also be found in a limited number of other bacteria, particularly gram-positive inhabitants of the GI tract (Akao (2000) <highlight><italic>Biol. Pharm. Bull. </italic></highlight>23:149-154; Akao (2000) <highlight><italic>Biol. Pharm. Bull. </italic></highlight>22:80-82; Hawkesworth et al. (1971) <highlight><italic>J. Med. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>4:451-459; McBain and Macfarlane (1998) <highlight><italic>J. Med. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>47:407-415). The gusA gene can also be found in Shigella species but activity is absent in many of the common, agriculturally-important bacterial species, such as Rhizobium, Agrobacterium, and Pseudomonas (GUS Protocols, 7-17 (S. Gallagher Ed. 1992)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> <highlight><italic>Lactobacillus gasseri </italic></highlight>ADH is a human intestinal isolate that was identified by its ability to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells (Kleeman and Klaenhammer (1982) <highlight><italic>J. Dairy Sci. </italic></highlight>65:2063-2069). <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>is one of a number of indigenous lactobacilli that are commonly associated with the microflora of a healthy human GI tract (Molin et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>J. Appl. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>74:314-323; Song et al. (2000) <highlight><italic>FEMS Microbiol. Lett. </italic></highlight>187:167-173). A number of these lactobacilli are currently under investigation to determine the mechanistic basis of a variety of proposed probiotic activities (Klaenhammer (1998) <highlight><italic>Int. Dairy J. </italic></highlight>8:497-506). It remains an important objective to characterize the physiological and enzymatic activities of this group of organisms and ultimately to identify the genetic factors responsible for those activities. Studies with various Lactobacillus species, including <highlight><italic>L. gasseri</italic></highlight>, have consistently shown their ability to reduce the amount of fecal &bgr;-glucuronidase activity and lower the occurrence of cancer indicators present in the GI tract (de Roos and Katan (2000) <highlight><italic>Am. J. Clin. Nutr. </italic></highlight>71:405-411; Jin et al. (2000) <highlight><italic>Poult. Sci </italic></highlight>79:886-891; Ling et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Ann. Nutr. Metab. </italic></highlight>36:162-166; McConnell and Tannock (1993) <highlight><italic>J. Appl. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>74:649-651; Pedrosa et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Am. J Clin. Nutr. </italic></highlight>61:353-359). The mechanisms by which lactobacilli lower the amount of &bgr;-glucuronidase activity in the gut remain unknown but may be the reflection of a variety of activities including, but not limited to, the exclusion or antagonism of typically &bgr;-glucuronidase-positive enterobacteria. Because lactobacilli colonize the proximal region of the small intestine, it is reasonable to expect them to be frequently exposed to &bgr;-D-glucuronides excreted via bile into the GI tract. Indeed, their frequent exposure to bile is reflected in the common occurrence of conjugated bile acid hydrolysis among different species (Christiaens et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Appl. Environ. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>58:3792-3798; Elkins and Savage (1998) <highlight><italic>J. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>180:4344-4349). Lactobacilli themselves have not traditionally been associated with &bgr;-glucuronidase activity, however, and there have been, to date, only two reports of &bgr;-glucuronidase-like activity in lactobacilli (McConnell and Tannock (1993) <highlight><italic>J. Appl. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>74:649-651; Pham et al (2000) <highlight><italic>Appl. Environ. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>66:2302-2310). It has been unclear, however, whether this &bgr;-glucuronidase activity was the result of a true &bgr;-glucuronidase enzyme or reflected the activity of some other enzyme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A disadvantage of currently available GUS proteins is that they have limited activity in acidic pH environments. Since acidic pH environments characterize a variety of industrial fermentation processes in which current GUS proteins cannot be be effectively used, it would be extremely useful to have new GUS proteins that operate at an acidic pH. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying figures, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Amino acid sequences disclosed herein are presented in the amino to carboxy direction, from left to right. The amino and carboxy groups are not presented in the sequence. Nucleotide sequences are presented herein by single strand only, in the 5&prime; to 3&prime; direction, from left to right. Nucleotides and amino acids are represented herein in the manner recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission, or (for amino acids) by three letter code, in accordance with 37 C.F.R &sect;1.822 and established usage. See, e.g., PatentIn User Manual, 99-102 (November 1990) (U.S. Patent and Trademark Office). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> 1. Definitions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The GUS protein, as used herein, refers to the amino acid sequence of substantially purified GUS obtained from any species and is substantially homologous to the proteins described herein. GUS protein as described herein may be obtained from the genus Lactobacillus and preferably from <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>ADH. GUS proteins as described herein preferably have maximum activity at an acidic pH, e.g., at a pH less than 7 or 6, and may have a maximum activity at a pH of from 3 to 5 or 6. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An &ldquo;allele&rdquo; or &ldquo;allelic sequence,&rdquo; as used herein, is an alternative form of the genes encoding GUS. Alleles may result from at least one mutation in the nucleic acid sequence and may result in altered mRNAs or polypeptides whose structure or function may or may not be altered. Any given natural or recombinant gene may have none, one, or many allelic forms. Common mutational changes which give rise to alleles are generally ascribed to natural deletions, additions, or substitutions of nucleotides. Each of these types of changes may occur alone, or in combination with the others, one or more times in a given sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Amplification&rdquo;, as used herein, refers to the production of additional copies of a nucleic acid sequence and is generally carried out using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technologies well known in the art (Dieffenbach, C. W. and G. S. Dveksler (1995) <highlight><italic>PCR Primer, a Laboratory Manual</italic></highlight>, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, N.Y.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Antibody&rdquo; as used herein refers to intact molecules as well as fragments thereof, such as Fa, F(ab&prime;)2, and Fc, and chimeras thereof, which are capable of binding the epitopic determinant. Antibodies that bind GUS polypeptides can be prepared using intact GUS or fragments containing small peptides of interest as the immunizing antigen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Homology&rdquo;, as used herein, refers to a degree of complementarity. There may be partial homology or complete homology (i.e., identity). A partially complementary sequence that at least partially inhibits an identical sequence from hybridizing to a target nucleic acid is referred to using the functional term &ldquo;substantially homologous.&rdquo; The inhibition of hybridization of the completely complementary sequence to the target sequence may be examined using a hybridization assay (Southern or northern blot, solution hybridization and the like) under conditions of low stringency. A substantially homologous sequence or hybridization probe will compete for and inhibit the binding of a completely homologous sequence to the target sequence under conditions of low stringency. This is not to say that conditions of low stringency are such that non-specific binding is permitted; low stringency conditions require that the binding of two sequences to one another be a specific (i.e., selective) interaction. The absence of non-specific binding may be tested by the use of a second target sequence which lacks even a partial degree of complementarity (e.g., less than about 30% identity). In the absence of non-specific binding, the probe will not hybridize to the second non-complementary target sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;hybridization&rdquo;, as used herein, refers to any process by which a strand of nucleic acid binds with a complementary strand through base pairing. The term &ldquo;hybridization complex&rdquo;, as used herein, refers to a complex formed between two nucleic acid sequences by virtue of the formation of hydrogen bonds between complementary G and C bases and between complementary A and T bases; these hydrogen bonds may be further stabilized by base stacking interactions. The two complementary nucleic acid sequences hydrogen bond in an antiparallel configuration. A hybridization complex may be formed in solution (e.g., C<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>t or R<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>t analysis) or between one nucleic acid sequence present in solution and another nucleic acid sequence immobilized on a solid support (e.g., paper, membranes, filters, chips, pins or glass slides, or any other appropriate substrate to which cells or their nucleic acids have been fixed). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> By &ldquo;nucleic acid&rsquo; or &ldquo;oligonucleotide&rdquo; or grammatical equivalents herein means at least two nucleotides covalently linked together. A nucleic acid of the present invention will generally contain phosphodiester bonds, although in some cases, as outlined below, nucleic acid analogs are included that may have alternate backbones, comprising, for example, phosphoramide (Beaucage, et al., Tetrahedron, 49(10):1925 (1993) and references therein; Letsinger, <highlight><italic>J.

Nos. 5,235,033 and 5,034,506, and Chapters 6 and 7, ASC Symposium Series 580, &ldquo;Carbohydrate Modifications in Antisense Research,&rdquo; Ed. Y. S. Sanghui and P. Dan Cook. Nucleic acids containing one or more carbocyclic sugars are also included within the definition of nucleic acids (see Jenkins, et al., <highlight><italic>Chem. Soc. Rev</italic></highlight>., (1995) pp. 169-176). Several nucleic acid analogs are described in Rawls, <highlight><italic>C </italic></highlight>&amp; <highlight><italic>E News</italic></highlight>, Jun. 2, 1997, page 35. These modifications of the ribose-phosphate backbone may be done to facilitate the addition of additional moieties such as labels, or to increase the stability and half-life of such molecules in physiological environments. In addition, mixtures of naturally-occurring nucleic acids and analogs can be made. Alternatively, mixtures of different nucleic acid analogs, and mixtures of naturally-occurring nucleic acids and analogs may be made. The nucleic acids may be single-stranded or double-stranded, as specified, or contain portions of both double-stranded or single-stranded sequence. The nucleic acid may be DNA, both genomic and cDNA, RNA or a hybrid, where the nucleic acid contains any combination of deoxyribo- and ribo-nucleotides, and any combination of bases, including uracil, adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, inosine, xathanine hypoxathanine, isocytosine, isoguanine, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As described above generally for proteins, nucleic acid candidate bioactive agents may be naturally-occurring nucleic acids, random nucleic acids, or &ldquo;biased&rdquo; random nucleic acids. For example, digests of procaryotic or eukaryotic genomes may be used as is outlined above for proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Nucleic acid sequence&rdquo; as used herein refers to an oligonucleotide, nucleotide, or polynucleotide, and fragments thereof, and to DNA or RNA of genomic or synthetic origin which may be single- or double-stranded, and represent the sense or antisense strand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;oligonucleotide&rdquo; refers to a nucleic acid sequence of at least about 6 nucleotides to about 60 nucleotides, preferably about 15 to 30 nucleotides, and more preferably about 20 to 25 nucleotides, which can be used in PCR amplification or a hybridization assay, or a microarray. As used herein, oligonucleotide is substantially equivalent to the terms &ldquo;amplimers&rdquo;, &ldquo;primers&rdquo;, &ldquo;oligomers&rdquo;, and &ldquo;probes&rdquo;, as commonly defined in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The terms &ldquo;stringent conditions&rdquo; or &ldquo;stringency&rdquo;, as used herein, refer to the conditions for hybridization as defined by the nucleic acid, salt, and temperature. These conditions are well known in the art and may be altered in order to identify or detect identical or related polynucleotide sequences. Numerous equivalent conditions comprising either low or high stringency depend on factors such as the length and nature of the sequence (DNA, RNA, base composition), nature of the target (DNA, RNA, base composition), milieu (in solution or immobilized on a solid substrate), concentration of salts and other components (e.g., formamide, dextran sulfate and/or polyethylene glycol), and temperature of the reactions (within a range from about 5&deg; below the melting temperature of the probe to about 20&deg; C. to 25&deg;. below the melting temperature). One or more factors may be varied to generate conditions of either low or high stringency different from, but equivalent to, the above listed conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Transformation&rdquo;, as defined herein, describes a process by which exogenous DNA enters and changes a recipient cell. It may occur under natural or artificial conditions using various methods well known in the art. Transformation may rely on any known method for the insertion of foreign nucleic acid sequences into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell. The method is selected based on the type of host cell being transformed and may include, but is not limited to, viral infection, electroporation, heat shock, lipofection, and particle bombardment. Such &ldquo;transformed&rdquo; cells include stably-transformed cells in which the inserted DNA is capable of replication either as an autonomously replicating plasmid or as part of the host chromosome. They also include cells which transiently express the inserted DNA or RNA for limited periods of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> 2. &bgr;-Glucuronidase (GUS) Coding Sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Polynucleotides of the present invention include those coding for proteins homologous to, and having essentially the same biological properties as, the proteins disclosed herein, and particularly the DNA disclosed herein as SEQ ID NO:1 and encoding the protein GUS given herein SEQ ID NO:2. This definition is intended to encompass natural allelic sequences thereof. Thus, isolated DNA or cloned genes of the present invention can be of any isolate of <highlight><italic>Lactobacillus gasseri</italic></highlight>, such as <highlight><italic>Lactobacillus gasseri </italic></highlight>ADHn. Thus, polynucleotides that hybridize to DNA disclosed herein as SEQ ID NO:1 (or fragments or derivatives thereof which serve as hybridization probes as discussed below) and which code on expression for a protein of the present invention (e.g., a protein according to SEQ ID NO:2) are also an aspect of the invention. Conditions which will permit other polynucleotides that code on expression for a protein of the present invention to hybridize to the DNA of SEQ ID NO:1 disclosed herein can be determined in accordance with known techniques. For example, hybridization of such sequences may be carried out under conditions of reduced stringency, medium stringency or even stringent conditions (e.g., conditions represented by a wash stringency of 35-40% Formamide with 5&times; Denhardt&apos;s solution, 0.5% SDS and 1&times; SSPE at 37&deg; C.; conditions represented by a wash stringency of 40-45% Formamide with 5&times; Denhardt&apos;s solution, 0.5% SDS, and 1&times; SSPE at 42&deg; C.; and conditions represented by a wash stringency of 50% Formamide with 5&times; Denhardt&apos;s solution, 0.5% SDS and 1&times; SSPE at 42&deg; C., respectively) to DNA of SEQ ID NO:1 disclosed herein in a standard hybridization assay. See, e.g., J. Sambrook et al., <highlight><italic>Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual </italic></highlight>(2d Ed. 1989) (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). In general, sequences which code for proteins of the present invention and which hybridize to the DNA of SEQ ID NO:1 disclosed herein will be at least 60% homologous, 70% homologous, 80% homologous, or even 90% homologous or more with SEQ ID NO:1. Further, polynucleotides that code for proteins of the present invention, or polynucleotides that hybridize to that as SEQ ID NO:1, but which differ in codon sequence from SEQ ID NO:1 due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, are also an aspect of this invention. The degeneracy of the genetic code, which allows different nucleic acid sequences to code for the same protein or peptide, is well known in the literature. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,757,006 to Toole et al. at Col. 2, Table 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Although nucleotide sequences which encode GUS and its variants are preferably capable of hybridizing to the nucleotide sequence of the naturally-occurring gusA under appropriately-selected conditions of stringency, it may be advantageous to produce nucleotide sequences encoding GUS or its derivatives possessing a substantially different codon usage. Codons may be selected to increase the rate at which expression of the peptide occurs in a particular prokaryotic or eukaryotic host in accordance with the frequency with which particular codons are utilized by the host. Other reasons for substantially-altering the nucleotide sequence encoding GUS and its derivatives without altering the encoded amino acid sequences include the production of RNA transcripts having more desirable properties, such as a greater half-life, than transcripts produced from the naturally-occurring sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, gusA nucleic acids (defined as polynucleotides encoding GUS proteins or fragments thereof), or GUS proteins (as defined above) are initially-identified by substantial nucleic acid and/or amino acid sequence identity or similarity to the sequence(s) provided herein. In a preferred embodiment, gusA nucleic acids or GUS proteins have sequence identity or similarity to the sequences provided herein as described below and one or more of the GUS protein bioactivities as further described herein. Such sequence identity or similarity can be based upon the overall nucleic acid or amino acid sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As is known in the art, a number of different programs can be used to identify whether a protein (or nucleic acid as discussed below) has sequence identity or similarity to a known sequence. Sequence identity and/or similarity is determined using standard techniques known in the art, including, but not limited to, the local sequence identity algorithm of Smith &amp; Waterman, <highlight><italic>Adv. Appl. Math. </italic></highlight>2, 482 (1981), by the sequence identity alignment algorithm of Needleman &amp; Wunsch, <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>48,443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson &amp; Lipman, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S. USA </italic></highlight>85,2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis.), the Best Fit sequence program described by Devereux et al., <highlight><italic>Nucl. Acid Res. </italic></highlight>12, 387-395 (1984), preferably using the default settings, or by inspection. Preferably, percent identity is calculated by FastDB based upon the following parameters: mismatch penalty of 1; gap penalty of 1; gap size penalty of 0.33; and joining penalty of 30, &ldquo;Current Methods in Sequence Comparison and Analysis,&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Macromolecule Sequencing and Synthesis, Selected Methods and Applications</italic></highlight>, pp 127-149 (1988), Alan R. Liss, Inc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> An example of a useful algorithm is PILEUP. PILEUP creates a multiple sequence alignment from a group of related sequences using progressive, pairwise alignments. It can also plot a tree showing the clustering relationships used to create the alignment. PILEUP uses a simplification of the progressive alignment method of Feng &amp; Doolittle, <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Evol. </italic></highlight>35, 351-360 (1987); the method is similar to that described by Higgins &amp; Sharp <highlight><italic>CABIOS </italic></highlight>5, 151-153 (1989). Useful PILEUP parameters including a default gap weight of 3.00, a default gap length weight of 0.10, and weighted end gaps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Another example of a useful algorithm is the BLAST algorithm, described in Altschul et al., <highlight><italic>J. Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>215, 403-410, (1990) and Karlin et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>90, 5873-5787 (1993). A particularly useful BLAST program is the WU-BLAST-2 program which was obtained from Altschul et al., <highlight><italic>Methods in Enzymology, </italic></highlight>266, 460-480 (1996); http://blast.wustl/edu/blast/README.html. WU-BLAST-2 uses several search parameters, most of which are set to the default values. The adjustable parameters are set with the following values: overlap span&equals;1, overlap fraction&equals;0.125, word threshold (T)&equals;11. The HSP S and HSP S2 parameters are dynamic values and are established by the program itself depending upon the composition of the particular sequence and composition of the particular database against which the sequence of interest is being searched; however, the values may be adjusted to increase sensitivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> An additional useful algorithm is gapped BLAST as reported by Altschul et al. <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>25, 3389-3402. Gapped BLAST uses BLOSUM-62 substitution scores; threshold T parameter set to 9; the two-hit method to trigger ungapped extensions, charges gap lengths of k a cost of 10&plus;k; X<highlight><subscript>u </subscript></highlight>set to 16, and X<highlight><subscript>g </subscript></highlight>set to 40 for database search stage and to 67 for the output stage of the algorithms. Gapped alignments are triggered by a score corresponding to &tilde;22 bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> A percentage amino acid sequence identity value is determined by the number of matching identical residues divided by the total number of residues of the &ldquo;longer&rdquo; sequence in the aligned region. The &ldquo;longer&rdquo; sequence is the one having the most actual residues in the aligned region (gaps introduced by WU-Blast-2 to maximize the alignment score are ignored). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In a similar manner, &ldquo;percent (%) nucleic acid sequence identity&rdquo; with respect to the coding sequence of the polypeptides identified herein is defined as the percentage of nucleotide residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the nucleotide residues in the coding sequence of the cell cycle protein. A preferred method utilizes the BLASTN module of WU-BLAST-2 set to the default parameters, with overlap span and overlap fraction set to 1 and 0.125, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The alignment may include the introduction of gaps in the sequences to be aligned. In addition, for sequences which contain either more or fewer amino acids than the protein encoded by the sequence in SEQ ID NO:1, it is understood that in one embodiment, the percentage of sequence identity will be determined based on the number of identical amino acids in relation to the total number of amino acids. Thus, for example, sequence identity of sequences shorter than that shown in the Figure, as discussed below, will be determined using the number of amino acids in the shorter sequence, in one embodiment. In percent identity calculations relative weight is not assigned to various manifestations of sequence variation, such as, insertions, deletions, substitutions, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, only identities are scored positively (&plus;1) and all forms of sequence variation including gaps are assigned a value of &ldquo;0&rdquo;, which obviates the need for a weighted scale or parameters as described below for sequence similarity calculations. Percent sequence identity can be calculated, for example, by dividing the number of matching identical residues by the total number of residues of the &ldquo;shorter&rdquo; sequence in the aligned region and multiplying by 100. The &ldquo;longer&rdquo; sequence is the one having the most actual residues in the aligned region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The invention also encompasses production of DNA sequences, or fragments thereof, which encode GUS and its derivatives, entirely by synthetic chemistry. After production, the synthetic sequence may be inserted into any of the many available expression vectors and cell systems using reagents that are well known in the art. Moreover, synthetic chemistry may be used to introduce mutations into a sequence encoding GUS or any fragment thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Knowledge of the nucleotide sequence as disclosed herein in SEQ ID NO:1 can be used to generate hybridization probes which specifically bind to the DNA of the present invention or to mRNA to determine the presence of amplification or overexpression of the proteins of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> 3. Expression of Nucleic Acids Encoding GUS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The production of cloned genes, recombinant DNA, vectors, transformed host cells, proteins and protein fragments by genetic engineering is well known. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,761,371 to Bell et al. at Col. 6 line 3 to Col. 9 line 65; U.S. Pat. No. 4,877,729 to Clark et al. at Col. 4 line 38 to Col. 7 line 6; U.S. Pat. No. 4,912,038 to Schilling at Col. 3 line 26 to Col. 14 line 12; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,879,224 to Wallner at Col. 6 line 8 to Col. 8 line 59. (Applicant specifically intends that the disclosure of all patent references cited herein be incorporated herein in their entirety by reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Methods for DNA sequencing which are well known and generally available in the art may be used to practice any of the embodiments of the invention. The methods may employ such enzymes as the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, SEQUENASE&reg; (US Biochemical Corp, Cleveland, Ohio), Taq polymerase (Perkin Elmer), thermostable T7 polymerase (Amersham, Chicago, Ill.), or combinations of polymerases and proofreading exonucleases such as those found in the ELONGASE Amplification System marketed by Gibco/BRL (Gaithersburg, Md.). Preferably, the process is automated with machines such as the Hamilton Micro Lab 2200 (Hamilton, Reno, Nev.), Peltier Thermal Cycler (PTC200; MJ Research, Watertown, Mass.) and the ABI Catalyst and 373 and 377 DNA Sequencers (Perkin Elmer). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The nucleic acid sequence encoding GUS may be extended utilizing a partial nucleotide sequence and employing various methods known in the art to detect upstream sequences such as promoters and regulatory elements. For example, one method which may be employed, &ldquo;restriction-site&rdquo; PCR, uses universal primers to retrieve unknown sequence adjacent to a known locus (Sarkar, G. (1993) <highlight><italic>PCR Methods Applic. </italic></highlight>2, 318-322). In particular, genomic DNA is first amplified in the presence of primer to a linker sequence and a primer specific to the known region. The amplified sequences are then subjected to a second round of PCR with the same linker primer and another specific primer internal to the first one. Products of each round of PCR are transcribed with an appropriate RNA polymerase and sequenced using reverse transcriptase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> A vector is a replicable DNA construct. Vectors are used herein either to amplify DNA encoding the proteins of the present invention or to express the proteins of the present invention. An expression vector is a replicable DNA construct in which a DNA sequence encoding the proteins of the present invention is operably linked to suitable control sequences capable of effecting the expression of proteins of the present invention in a suitable host. The need for such control sequences will vary depending upon the host selected and the transformation method chosen. Generally, control sequences include a transcriptional promoter, an optional operator sequence to control transcription, a sequence encoding suitable mRNA ribosomal binding sites, and sequences which control the termination of transcription and translation. Amplification vectors do not require expression control domains. All that is needed is the ability to replicate in a host, usually conferred by an origin of replication, and a selection gene to facilitate recognition of transformants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Vectors comprise plasmids, viruses (e.g., adenovirus, cytomegalovirus), phage, retroviruses and integratable DNA fragments (i.e., fragments integratable into the host genome by recombination). The vector replicates and functions independently of the host genome, or may, in some instances, integrate into the genome itself. Expression vectors should contain a promoter and RNA binding sites which are operably linked to the gene to be expressed and are operable in the host organism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> DNA regions are operably linked or operably-associated when they are functionally-related to each other. For example, a promoter is operably-linked to a coding sequence if it controls the transcription of the sequence; a ribosome binding site is operably-linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to permit translation. Generally, operably-linked means contiguous and, in the case of leader sequences, contiguous and in reading phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Transformed host cells are cells which have been transformed or transfected with vectors containing DNA coding for proteins of the present invention and need not express protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Suitable host cells include bacterial cells, yeast cells, or higher eukaryotic organism cells. Bacterial cells that may be employed as host cells include lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Lactococcus bacteria. Higher eukaryotic cells include plants (e.g., vascular plants such as monocots and dicots) and plant cells and established cell lines of mammalian origin as described below. Exemplary host cells are <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>W3110 (ATCC 27,325), <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>B, <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>X1776 (ATCC 31,537), <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>294 (ATCC 31,446). A broad variety of suitable prokaryotic and microbial vectors are available. <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>is typically transformed using pBR322. See Bolivar et al., <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>2, 95 (1977). Promoters most commonly used in recombinant microbial expression vectors include the beta-lactamase (penicillinase) and lactose promoter systems (Chang et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>275, 615 (1978); and Goeddel et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>281, 544 (1979), a tryptophan (trp) promoter system (Goeddel et al., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>8, 4057 (1980) and EPO App. Publ. No. 36,776) and the tac promoter (H. De Boer et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>80, 21 (1983). The promoter and Shine-Dalgarno sequence (for prokaryotic host expression) are operably-linked to the DNA of the present invention, i.e., they are positioned so as to promote transcription of the messenger RNA from the DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Expression vectors should contain a promoter which is recognized by the host organism. This generally means a promoter obtained from the intended host. Promoters most commonly used in recombinant microbial expression vectors include the beta-lactamase (penicillinase) and lactose promoter systems (Chang et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>275, 615 (1978); and Goeddel et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>281, 544 (1979), a tryptophan (trp) promoter system (Goeddel et al., <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Res. </italic></highlight>8, 4057 (1980) and EPO App. Publ. No. 36,776) and the tac promoter (H. De Boer et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>80, 21 (1983). While these are commonly used, other microbial promoters are suitable. Details concerning nucleotide sequences of many have been published, enabling a skilled worker to operably-ligate them to DNA encoding the protein in plasmid or viral vectors (Siebenlist et al., <highlight><italic>Cell </italic></highlight>20, 269 (1980). The promoter and Shine-Dalgarno sequence (for prokaryotic host expression) are operably-linked to the DNA encoding the desired protein, i.e., they are positioned so as to promote transcription of the protein messenger RNA from the DNA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Eukaryotic microbes such as yeast cultures may be transformed with suitable protein-encoding vectors. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,745,057. <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic></highlight>is the most commonly used among lower eukaryotic host microorganisms, although a number of other strains are commonly available. Yeast vectors may contain an origin of replication from the 2 micron yeast plasmid or anautonomously replicating sequence (ARS), a promoter, DNA encoding the desired protein, sequences for polyadenylation and transcription termination, and a selection gene. An exemplary plasmid is YRp7, (Stinchcomb et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>282, 39 (1979); Kingsman et al., <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>7, 141 (1979); Tschemper et al., <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>10, 157 (1980). This plasmid contains the trp1 gene, which provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4-1 (Jones, <highlight><italic>Genetics </italic></highlight>85, 12 (1977). The presence of the trp1 lesion in the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Suitable promoting sequences in yeast vectors include the promoters for metallothionein, 3-phospho-glycerate kinase (Hitzeman et al., <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>255, 2073 (1980) or other glycolytic enzymes (Hess et al., <highlight><italic>J. Adv. Enzyme Reg. </italic></highlight>7, 149 (1968); and Holland et al., <highlight><italic>Biochemistry </italic></highlight>17, 4900 (1978), such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in R. Hitzeman et al., EPO Publn. No. 73,657. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Plants can be transformed according to the present invention using any suitable method known in the art. Intact plants, plant tissue, isolated cells, protoplasts, callus tissue, and the like may be used for transformation depending on the plant species and the method employed. . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Exemplary transformation methods include biological methods using viruses (RNA and DNA viruses) and Agrobacterium (See, e.g., Hooykaas, <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. </italic></highlight>13, 327 (1989); Smith et al., <highlight><italic>Crop Science </italic></highlight>35, 301 (1995); Chilton, <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>90, 3119 (1993); Mollony et al., <highlight><italic>Monograph Theor. Appl. Genet NY </italic></highlight>19, 148 (1993); Ishida et al., <highlight><italic>Nature Biotechnol. </italic></highlight>14, 745 (1996); and Komari et al., <highlight><italic>The Plant Journal </italic></highlight>10, 165 (1996)), physicochemical methods such as electroporation, polyethylene glycol, ballistic bombardment, microinjection, and the like. In one form of direct transformation, the vector is microinjected directly into plant cells by use of micropipettes to mechanically transfer the recombinant DNA (Crossway, <highlight><italic>Mol. Gen. Genetics </italic></highlight>(1985) 202:179-185). In another protocol, the genetic material is transferred into the plant cell using polyethylene glycol (Krens, et al. <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>(1982) 296:72-74). In still another method, protoplasts are fused with minicells, cells, lysosomes, or other fusible lipid-surfaced bodies that contain the nucleotide sequence to be transferred to the plant (Fraley, et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>(1982) 79:1859-1863). DNA may also be introduced into the plant cells by electroporation (Fromm et al., <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>(1985) 82:5824). In this technique, plant protoplasts are electroporated in the presence of plasmids containing the expression cassette. Electrical impulses of high field strength reversibly permeabilize biomembranes allowing the introduction of the plasmids. Electroporated plant protoplasts reform the cell wall, divide and regenerate. One advantage of electroporation is that large pieces of DNA, including artificial chromosomes, can be transformed by this method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Two exemplary classes of recombinant Ti and Ri plasmid vector systems are commonly used in the art. In one class, called &ldquo;cointegrate,&rdquo; the shuttle vector containing the gene of interest is inserted by genetic recombination into a non-oncogenic Ti plasmid that contains both the cis-acting and trans-acting elements required for plant transformation as, for example, in the PMLJ1 shuttle vector of DeBlock et al., <highlight><italic>EMBO J </italic></highlight>(1984) 3:1681-1689, and the non-oncogenic Ti plasmid pGV2850 described by Zambryski et al., <highlight><italic>EMBOJ</italic></highlight>(1983) 2:2143-2150. In the second class or &ldquo;binary&rdquo; system, the gene of interest is inserted into a shuttle vector containing the cis-acting elements required for plant transformation. The other necessary functions are provided in trans by the non-oncogenic Ti plasmid as exemplified by the pBIN19 shuttle vector described by Bevan, <highlight><italic>Nucleic Acids Research </italic></highlight>(1984) 12:8711-8721, and the non-oncogenic Ti plasmid PAL4404 described by Hoekma, et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>(1983) 303:179-180. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Plant cells may be transformed with Agrobacteria by any means known in the art, e.g., by co-cultivation with cultured isolated protoplasts, or transformation of intact cells or tissues. The first requires an established culture system that allows for culturing protoplasts and subsequent plant regeneration from cultured protoplasts. Identification of transformed cells or plants is generally accomplished by including a selectable marker in the transforming vector, or by obtaining evidence of successful bacterial infection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In plants stably-transformed by Agrobacteria-mediated transformation, the nucleotide sequence of interest is incorporated into the plant genome, typically flanked by at least one T-DNA border sequence. Preferably, the nucleotide sequence of interest is flanked by two T-DNA border sequences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Plant cells which have been transformed by any method known in the art can also be regenerated to produce intact plants using known techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Plant regeneration from cultured protoplasts is described in Evans et al., <highlight><italic>Handbook of Plant Cell Cultures</italic></highlight>, Vol. 1: (MacMilan Publishing Co. New York, 1983); and Vasil I. R. (ed.), <highlight><italic>Cell Culture and Somatic Cell Genetics of Plants</italic></highlight>, Acad. Press, Orlando, Vol. I, 1984, and Vol. II, 1986). It is known that practically all plants can be regenerated from cultured cells or tissues, including but not limited to, all major species of sugar-cane, sugar beet, cotton, fruit trees, and legumes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The particular conditions for transformation, selection and regeneration may be optimized by those of skill in the art. Factors that affect the efficiency of transformation include the species of plant, the tissue infected, composition of the media for tissue culture, selectable marker genes, the length of any of the above-described step, kinds of vectors, and light/dark conditions. Therefore, these and other factors may be varied to determine what is an optimal transformation protocol for any particular plant species. It is recognized that not every species will react in the same manner to the transformation conditions and may require a slightly different modification of the protocols disclosed herein. However, by altering each of the variables, an optimum protocol can be derived for any plant species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Cultures of cells derived from multicellular organisms are a desirable host for recombinant protein synthesis. In principal, any higher eukaryotic cell culture is workable, whether from vertebrate or invertebrate culture, including insect cells. Propagation of such cells in cell culture has become a routine procedure. See Tissue Culture, Academic Press, Kruse and Patterson, editors (1973). Examples of useful host cell lines are VERO and HeLa cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, and WI138, BHK, COS-7, CV, and MDCK cell lines. Expression vectors for such cells ordinarily include (if necessary) an origin of replication, a promoter located upstream from the gene to be expressed, along with a ribosome binding site, RNA splice site (if intron-containing genomic DNA is used), a polyadenylation site, and a transcriptional termination sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The transcriptional and translational control sequences in expression vectors to be used in transforming vertebrate cells are often provided by viral sources. For example, commonly used promoters are derived from polyoma, Adenovirus 2, and Simian Virus 40 (SV40). See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,308. The early and late promoters are useful because both are obtained easily from the virus as a fragment which also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. See Fiers et al., <highlight><italic>Nature </italic></highlight>273, 113 (1978). Further, the protein promoter, control and/or signal sequences, may also be used, provided such control sequences are compatible with the host cell chosen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> An origin of replication may be provided either by construction of the vector to include an exogenous origin, such as may be derived from SV40 or other viral source (e.g. Polyoma, Adenovirus, VSV, or BPV), or may be provided by the host cell chromosomal replication mechanism. If the vector is integrated into the host cell chromosome, the latter may be sufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Host cells such as insect cells (e.g., cultured <highlight><italic>Spodoptera frugiperda </italic></highlight>cells) and expression vectors such as the baculorivus expression vector (e.g., vectors derived from <highlight><italic>Autographa californica </italic></highlight>MNPV, Trichoplusia ni MNPV, Rachiplusia ou MNPV, or Galleria ou MNPV) may be employed to make proteins useful in carrying out the present invention, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,745,051 and 4,879,236 to Smith et al. In general, a baculovirus expression vector comprises a baculovirus genome containing the gene to be expressed inserted into the polyhedrin gene at a position ranging from the polyhedrin transcriptional start signal to the ATG start site and under the transcriptional control of a baculovirus polyhedrin promoter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, sequences encoding GUS may be ligated into an adenovirus transcription/translation complex consisting of the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. Insertion in a non-essential E1 or E3 region of the viral genome may be used to obtain a viable virus which is capable of expressing GUS in infected host cells (Logan, J. and Shenk, T. (1984) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </italic></highlight>81:3655-3659). In addition, transcription enhancers, such as the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) enhancer, may be used to increase expression in mammalian host cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Rather than using vectors which contain viral origins of replication, one can transform mammalian cells by the method of cotransformation with a selectable-marker and the chimeric protein DNA. An example of a suitable selectable marker is dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or thymidine kinase. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,399,216. Such markers are proteins, generally enzymes, that enable the identification of transformant cells, i.e., cells which are competent to take up exogenous DNA. Generally, identification is by survival or transformants in culture medium that is toxic, or from which the cells cannot obtain critical nutrition without having taken up the marker protein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In addition to their use as markers, nucleic acids of the present invention, constructs containing the same and host cells that express the encoded proteins are useful for making proteins of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> 4. GUS Proteins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the present invention provides isolated and purified GUS protein, such as Lactobacillus (or more preferably <highlight><italic>L. gasseri</italic></highlight>) GUS. Such proteins can be purified from host cells which express the same, in accordance with known techniques, or even manufactured synthetically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Proteins of the present invention are useful as, among other things, standard reagents in GUS assays and as immunogens for making antibodies as described herein, and these antibodies and proteins provide a &ldquo;specific binding pair.&rdquo; Such specific binding pairs are useful as components of a variety of immunoassays and purification techniques (e.g., for the affinity purification of GUS protein), as is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A variety of protocols for detecting and measuring the expression of GUS, using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific for the protein are known in the art. Examples include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes on GUS can be used, but a competitive binding assay may be employed. These and other assays are described, among other places, in Hampton, R. et al. (1990<highlight><italic>; Serological Methods, a Laboratory Manual</italic></highlight>, APS Press, St Paul, Minn.) and Maddox, D. E. et al. ((1983) <highlight><italic>J. Exp. Med. </italic></highlight>158:1211-1216). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known by those skilled in the art and may be used in various nucleic acid and amino acid assays. Means for producing labeled-hybridization or PCR probes for detecting sequences related to polynucleotides encoding GUS include oligolabeling, nick translation, end-labeling or PCR amplification using a labeled nucleotide. Alternatively, the sequences encoding GUS, or any fragments thereof may be cloned into a vector for the production of an mRNA probe. Such vectors are known in the art, are commercially-available, and may be used to synthesize RNA probes in vitro by addition of an appropriate RNA polymerase such as T7, T3, or SP6 and labeled nucleotides. These procedures may be conducted using a variety of commercially-available kits (Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, (Kalamazoo, Mich.); Promega (Madison Wis.); and U.S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, Ohio)). Suitable reporter molecules or labels, which may be used for ease of detection, include radionuclides, enzymes, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, or chromogenic agents as well as substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, magnetic particles, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Host cells transformed with nucleotide sequences encoding GUS may be cultured under conditions suitable for the expression and recovery of the protein from cell culture. The protein produced by a transformed cell may be secreted or contained intracellularly depending on the sequence and/or the vector used. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, expression vectors containing polynucleotides which encode GUS may be designed to contain signal sequences which direct secretion of GUS through a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell membrane. Other constructions may be used to join sequences encoding GUS to nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide domain which will facilitate purification of soluble proteins. Such purification facilitating domains include, but are not limited to, metal chelating peptides such as histidine-tryptophan modules that allow purification on immobilized metals, protein A domains that allow purification on immobilized immunoglobulin, and the domain utilized in the FLAGS extension/affinity purification system (Immunex Corp., Seattle, Wash.). The inclusion of cleavable linker sequences such as those specific for Factor XA or enterokinase (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.) between the purification domain and GUS may be used to facilitate purification. One such expression vector provides for expression of a fusion protein containing GUS and a nucleic acid encoding 6 histidine residues preceding a thioredoxin or an enterokinase cleavage site. The histidine residues facilitate purification on IMAC (immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography) as described in Porath, J. et al. ((1992), <highlight><italic>Prot. Exp. Purif. </italic></highlight>3, 263-281) while the enterokinase cleavage site provides a means for purifying GUS from the fusion protein. A discussion of vectors which contain fusion proteins is provided in Kroll, D. J. et al. (1993) <highlight><italic>DNA Cell Biol. </italic></highlight>12:441-453). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> In addition to recombinant production, fragments of GUS may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid-phase techniques (Merrifield J. (1963) <highlight><italic>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </italic></highlight>85, 2149-2154). Protein synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated synthesis may be achieved, for example, using Applied Biosystems 431A Peptide Synthesizer (Perkin Elmer). Various fragments of GUS may be chemically-ynthesized separately and combined using chemical methods to produce the full-length molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> 5. GUS Substrates and Assays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Assays for detecting the enzyme activity of GUS in a cell, or the extent of such activity, typically involve, first, contacting the cells or extracts of the cells containing proteins therefrom with a substrate that specifically binds to GUS enzyme as given herein (typically under conditions that permit access of the substrate to intracellular material), and then detecting the presence or absence of binding of the substrate thereto (e.g., by detecting the product of a chemical reaction on the substrate catalyzed by GUS). Again, any suitable assay format, including cell-free extracts or nondestructive methods to stain cells expressing GUS, can be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Test methods for the determination of GUS activity include but are not limited to the use of fluorogenic and chromogenic chemicals, i.e. are 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-glucuronide (X-GlcU) and para-nitrophyenyl &bgr;-D-glucuronide (PNPG), and 4-methylumbelliferyl-&bgr;-D-glucuronide (MUG). Many types of substrates (yielding either soluble, insoluble, or fluorescent products upon enzymatic cleavage) are available for detecting beta-glucuronidase. These substrates typically contain the sugar D-glucopyranosiduronic acid attached by a glycosidic linkage to a hydroxyl group of a chromogenic, fluorogenic, or other detectible molecule. Chromogenic substrates available for detection of beta-glucuronidase are, but are not limited to, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-glucuronide (X-G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>cU) and para-nitrophyenyl &bgr;-D-glucuronide (PNPG), and 5-bromo-6-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-glucuronide (Magenta-G<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>cA). The chromogenic substrates themselves are not colored so that the detection of colored transformed or transfected cells or cell extracts indicates the presence of the enzyme. The chromogenic substrates have been used to detect GUS activity in transformed plant cells and tissues (Sawahel and Fukui (1995) <highlight><italic>BioTechniques </italic></highlight>19, 106; Fromm et al. (1990) <highlight><italic>Bio/Technology </italic></highlight>8, 833), <highlight><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisae </italic></highlight>(Schmitz et al. (1990) <highlight><italic>Curr. Genet. </italic></highlight>17: 261) and used to detect <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>contamination in food and water (Frampton and Restaino (1993) <highlight><italic>J. Appl. Bacteriol. </italic></highlight>74, 223; Ogden and Watt (1991) <highlight><italic>Lett. Appl. Microbiol. </italic></highlight>13, 212; U.S. Pat. No. 4,923,804). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Similarly, fluorogenic substrates available for detection of beta-glucuronidase include are, but are not limited to, 4-methylumbelliferyl-&bgr;-D-glucuronide (MUG), 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl &bgr;-D-glucuronide (DiFMUGlcU), resorufin-&bgr;-D-glucuronide (ReG), 4-trifluoromethylumbelliferyl &bgr;-D-glucuronic acid (TFMUG), fluorescein mono-&bgr;-D-glucuronide, fluorescein di-&bgr;-D-glucuronide (FDGlcU), 5-(pentafluorobenzoylamino)fluorescein di-&bgr;-D-glucuronide (PFB-FDGlcU), DDAO &bgr;-D-glucuronide (DDAO GlcU), and naphthol-AS-BI &bgr;-D-glucuronide. The fluorogenic substrates have been used to detect GUS activity in whole plant tissue and plant extracts expressing <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>GUS (Jefferson (1988) <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. </italic></highlight>5, 387; Gallagher (1992) <highlight><italic>GUS Protocols: Using the GUS Gene as a Reporter for Gene Expression</italic></highlight>, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif.; Martin et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. </italic></highlight>10, 37), in the flow cytometric assay of individual mammalian cells expressing the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>GUS gene (Lorinez et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Cytometry </italic></highlight>24, 321; Lorincz et al. (1999) <highlight><italic>J. Biol. Chem. </italic></highlight>274, 657), in detecting <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>contamination in food and water (U.S. Pat. No 5,861,270; U.S. Pat. No. 5,935,799), and in detecting lysosomal enzyme release from neutrophils (Niessen et al. (1991) <highlight><italic>Cell Signal </italic></highlight>3, 625). In addition there are lipophilic derivatives, such as the ImaGene Green C<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>FDGlcU GUS Gene Expression Kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., OR) which will freely diffuse across the membranes of viable cultured tobacco leaf cells or protoplasts under physiological conditions (Fleming et al. (1996) <highlight><italic>Plant J. </italic></highlight>10, 745). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Methods of exposing the cell or cell-free extracts to substrate include, but not limited to, tissue or cell homogenization to release intracellular material, histochemical staining of cells or tissues fixed with paraformaldehyde, vacuum infiltration of whole tissue or cells, and non-destructive exposure of whole tissue or cells by submerging tissue in substrate or spraying tissue with substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Method of detecting release of chromogenic or fluorogenic molecules from substrates by GUS include, but are not limited to spectrophotometric, fluorometric, and microscopic visualization at the wavelengths appropriate for the detection of the released products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> As this <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>ADH gusA gene product has a maximal enzyme activity at low pH (3-5), it may be used as a reporter protein for organisms that are extremely aciduric. The protein itself may be used as a protein tag and detected by antibodies or activity or may be used as a marker of transformed cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>GUS enzyme has been used in many systems including plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria. The <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>and human enzymes have pH optima close to neutral and the plant enzyme has a pH optima of 5.0 (Alwen et al. (1992) <highlight><italic>Transgenic Res. </italic></highlight>1:63). To overcome the pH optima overlap of GUS of mammalian origin and <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>origin, researchers have had to use suboptimal pH conditions and calculations of percents of activity to determine individual activities of these enzymes (Ho and Ho (1985) <highlight><italic>J. Urol. </italic></highlight>134:1227). The present invention has the advantage that it can be used as a more distinguisable marker in mammalian systems and as a reporter in extremely aciduric organisms, where reliable reporter molecules have been scarce. Furthermore, because the current invention may differ in codon usage, functional pH range, substrate specificity, temperature optimum, or resistance to chemical treatment, it may have advantages over the prior art in specific applications or target organisms. Moreover, the differences listed above would be advantageous and allow for a two, three, four or more reporter strategy where each enzyme is detected at a different pH, with a different substrate, or at a different temperature optimum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the GUS proteins, nucleic acids, variants, modified proteins, cells and/or transgenics containing the gusA nucleic acids or proteins are used in screening assays. Identification of the GUS proteins provided herein permits the presence of GUS protein as a marker protein in low pH environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The assays described herein preferably utilize the <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>ADH GUS protein, although proteins from other <highlight><italic>Lactobacillus gasseri </italic></highlight>isolates may also be used, or homologous proteins from other species that encode a GUS having activity at a low pH. These latter embodiments may be preferred in the development of reporter proteins. In some embodiments, variant or derivative GUS proteins may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> A variety of other reagents may be included in the assays. These include reagents like salts, neutral proteins, e.g. albumin, detergents, etc which may be used to facilitate optimal protein activity and/or reduce non-specific or background activity. Also reagents that otherwise improve the efficiency of the assay, such as protease inhibitors, nuclease inhibitors, anti-microbial agents, etc., may be used. The mixture of components may be added in any order that provides for the requisite activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> X-GlcU and PNPG are used in an amount sufficient to produce a spectrophotometrically or visually detectable change in response to being cleaved by beta-glucuronidase enzyme, and is usually in the range of 10-150 &mgr;g/mL for X-GlcU and 100 &mgr;M-50 mM for PNPG, preferably about 50 &mgr;g/mL for X-GlcU and 1 mM for PNPG. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The buffer solution used in the assay may be any buffer which is used in a sufficient quantity to maintain the pH of the sample to be tested at about 3-5, preferably at pH 4.0. Preferably, the buffer is a mixture of NaH<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>PO<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>and Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>HPO<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, and is usually in the range of 0.05 to 1.5 M, preferably 1.0 M of sample, most preferably 0.1 M. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Spectrophotometric monitoring of the reaction mixture results in detection of a positive endpoint (i.e. increase in Absorbance of about 0.05 absorbance units) earlier than is possible for visual detection of the bright yellow color (PNPG) or detection of the bright blue color (X-GlcU) under long wave UV. Detection by visual or spectrophotometric methods can easily be accomplished within about 24 hours or less. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> 6. GUS Antibodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Antibodies that specifically bind to the proteins of the present invention (i.e., antibodies which bind to a single antigenic site or epitope on the proteins) are useful for a variety of purposes, as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Antibodies to GUS may be generated using methods that are well known in the art. Such antibodies may include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, chimeric, single chain, Fab fragments, and fragments produced by a Fab expression library. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> For the production of antibodies, various hosts including goats, rabbits, rats, mice, humans, and others, may be immunized by injection with GUS or any fragment or oligopeptide thereof which has immunogenic properties. Depending on the host species, various adjuvants may be used to increase immunological response. Such adjuvants include, but are not limited to, Freund&apos;s, mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, and surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and dinitrophenol. Among adjuvants used in humans, BCG (bacilli Calmette-Guerin) and <highlight><italic>Corynebacterium parvum </italic></highlight>are especially preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the oligopeptides, peptides, or fragments used to induce antibodies to GUS have an amino acid sequence consisting of at least five amino acids and more preferably at least 10 amino acids. It is also preferable that they are identical to a portion of the amino acid sequence of the natural protein, and they may contain the entire amino acid sequence of a small, naturally-occurring molecule. Short stretches of GUS amino acids may be fused with those of another protein such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin and antibody produced against the chimeric molecule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Monoclonal antibodies to GUS may be prepared using any technique which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. These include, but are not limited to, the hybridoma technique, the human B-cell hybridoma technique, and the EBV-hybridoma technique. See, e.g., Kohler, G. et al. (1975) <highlight><italic>Nature, </italic></highlight>256, 495-497; Kozbor, D. et al. (1985) <highlight><italic>J. Immunol. Methods </italic></highlight>81, 31-42; Cote, R. J. et al. (1983) <highlight><italic>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </italic></highlight>80, 2026-2030; Cole, S. P. et al. (1984) <highlight><italic>Mol. Cell Biol. </italic></highlight>62,109-120. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Various immunoassays may be used for screening to identify antibodies having the desired specificity. Numerous protocols for competitive binding or immunoradiometric assays using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies with established specificities are well known in the art. Such immunoassays typically involve the measurement of complex formation between GUS and its specific antibody. A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering GUS epitopes is preferred, but a competitive binding assay may also be employed (Maddox, supra). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Antibodies may be conjugated to a solid support suitable for an assay (e.g., beads, plates, slides or wells formed from materials such as latex or polystyrene) in accordance with known techniques, such as precipitation. Antibodies may likewise be conjugated to detectable groups such as radiolabels (e.g. <highlight><superscript>35</superscript></highlight>S, <highlight><superscript>125</superscript></highlight>I, <highlight><superscript>131</superscript></highlight>I), enzyme labels (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase), and fluorescent labels (e.g., fluorescein) in accordance with known techniques. </paragraph>

PCR was performed via standard protocols (Innis et al., PCR protocols: A guide to methods and applications, Academic Press 1990)). DNA sequencing on both strands of the template was performed with an ABI model 377 automated gene sequencer (Perkin-Elmer) or manually, with the ThermoSequenase&trade; kit (Amersham). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> A plasmid library of randomly-sheared <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>ADH genomic DNA, generated by nebulization of total genomic DNA, was T4 DNA Polymerase-treated to blunt the ends, and inserted into the SmaI site of pUC19. The resulting library was electroporated, using standard protocol, into supercompetent <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>DH10B (Gibco BRL) for amplification of the library. The amplified library was isolated by standard methods and electroporated into the GUS non-producing <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strain KW1 (Wilson et al. (1995) <highlight><italic>Microbiology </italic></highlight>141:1691) and screened for complementation of GUS activity. A GUS-positive clone was identified on LB plates containing 50 &mgr;g/mL X-GlcU&plus;200 &mgr;g/mL carbenicillin. The plasmid DNA insert from the GUS-producing isolate was completely sequenced and shown to encode two complete open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF, designated gusA, is a 1797 nucleotide ORF encoding a 598 amino acid protein sharing 39% identity with the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>GusA protein. The second ORF, designated ORF-R encodes a protein with weak homology to at least two classes of transcriptional activators from many other bacteria, and may play a role in the regulation of the gusA gene. </paragraph>

For the creation of plasmid pTRK664, the T7 terminator, Lactobacillus P6 promoter, and gusA gene were cloned sequentially into plasmid pTRK563. The T7 terminator was amplified from pET28a(&plus;)as an XhoI-SalI fragment as described previously (Walker and Klaenhammer (2000) <highlight><italic>Appl. Environ.

<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> For lactobacilli, &bgr;-glucuronidase activity in cell extracts (CFEs) was measured by the hydrolysis of para-nitrophenyl-&bgr;-D-glucuronide (PNPG) (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.). Cultures (10.0 ml each) were washed twice in 10.0 ml of GUS buffer (sodium phosphate buffer (1.0 M or 0.1 M)-2.5 mM EDTA &lsqb;pH 6.0&rsqb;) and resuspended in 1.0 ml of the same. Cell suspensions were then added to chilled tubes with silica beads and subjected to three 1-min cycles at the highest setting in a Mini Bead Beater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, Okla.) with 1 min on ice in between cycles. Following centrifugation to pellet beads and cell debris, the CFE was collected and kept temporarily on ice until the start of the assays. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (Bradford (1976) <highlight><italic>Anal. Biochem. </italic></highlight>72:248-254) using the Sigma protein determination kit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> For pH optima determination, two independent assays conditions were used that used different concentrations of sodium phosphate buffer and PNPG. The first assay was conducted in 1.0 M sodium phosphate buffer with the final concentration of 1.0 mM PNPG (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>). The second assay was performed in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer with a final concentration of 10.0 mM PNPG (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> CFEs were warmed to the assay temperature and 200 &mgr;l of sample was added to 800 &mgr;l of GUS buffer containing PNPG and incubated at 37&deg; C. (except during temperature experiments). The pH of the GUS buffer was 6.0 except during pH experiments, when sodium phosphate buffer at different pHs was used to prepare the GUS buffer. At appropriate time intervals, usually 5, 10, and 15 min, 100 &mgr;l of the reaction mixture was added to 800 &mgr;l of 1.0 M Na<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and the optical density was measured at 405 nm (OD<highlight><subscript>405</subscript></highlight>). One unit of activity is defined as 1 nmol of p-nitrophenol liberated per min per milligram of protein. For the measurement of activity in <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>cells, assays were performed nearly identically, except that whole cells disrupted with chloroform were used instead of cell extracts and assays were done at a pH of 4.0 to reduce any potential interference by the native <highlight><italic>E. coil </italic></highlight>&bgr;-glucuronidase. Enzyme activity for <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>experiments is represented per OD<highlight><subscript>600</subscript></highlight>. Each value presented is the average of results from at least three independent experiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> To better characterize the gusA gene and determine whether it could be expressed in other GUS-non-producing bacteria, the gusA gene was transformed and expressed, as determined by GUS activity, in three different <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>strains (DH10B, KW1, and Tuner (DE3) (Novagen)), <highlight><italic>L. acidophilus </italic></highlight>NCFM (ATCC 700396), and <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>ATCC 33323. Using the <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>ATCC 33323 strain expressing <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>ADH GUS, the optimal pH range of the GUS enzyme was determined. Using 1.0 M sodium phosphate buffer and 1.0 mM PNPG, it was observed that <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>ADH GUS was most active at low pH, exhibiting optimum activity near pH 4.0 and retaining greater than 95% of its activity at pH 3.0 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>). Using 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer with 10.0 mM PNPG, the activity dropped off quickly at pH values above 6.0, but the enzyme retained more than 50% activity at a pH of 4.0 and approximately 33% activity at pH 3.0 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>). Lower pH conditions were not tested. The differenced observed between the data presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> can be attributed to the differences in the buffering capacity of the buffer (1.0 M vs. 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer) and the final concentration of PNPG which is an acid. Similar to the <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>ADH GUS expressed in <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>ATCC 33323, <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>ADH GUS activity was dimished at pH 7.5 (right test tube, yellow coloration) as compared to pH 3.0 (right test tube, blue coloration) when the enzyme was expressed in an <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>host strain (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

To determine if the GUS activity detected in these isolates correlated with the presence of a gusA gene, PCR amplification, with primers GUS-1F (SEQ ID NO:13) and GUS-1R (SEQ ID NO:14) designed to the <highlight><italic>Lactobacillus gasseri </italic></highlight>ADH gusA locus, was performed on the <highlight><italic>Lactobacillus gasseri </italic></highlight>isolates.

<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Plasmid pWMR35 was constructed as described in study EXAMPLE 3. A similar vector, plasmid pWMR39 was created which differed only in that it contained the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>gusA gene in place of the <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>gusA gene. An additional plasmid, pTRK570, was used which contained the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>gusA gene expressed from the P6 promoter on the high-copy shuttle vector pTRKH2 (O&apos;Sullivan and Klaenhammer, <highlight><italic>Gene </italic></highlight>137 (1993). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> Results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> Plasmids pWMR36 and pWMR39 are both low-copy number vectors which contain the P6 promoter driving expression of either the <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>or the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>gusA gene. <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>transformants of both plasmids showed GUS activity as observed by blue colonies on BHI/X-glu plates. However, only plasmid pWMR35 gave rise to blue colonies in <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>ATCC33323 plated on MRS/X-glu plates. Log-phase cultures containing each of the plasmids were assayed for GUS activity. Only 18.9 U of activity could be detected from <highlight><italic>L. gasseri</italic></highlight>::pWMR39, compared with 2801 U from <highlight><italic>L. gasseri</italic></highlight>::pWMR35. In an attempt to increase the amount of <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>GUS being detected from <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>cells, pTRK570, a high-copy vector containing the P6 promoter and <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>gusA gene, was transformed into <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>ATCC33323. Transformants plated on MRS/X-glu were a mixture of white and blue colonies. Both types of colonies, when replated, gave rise again to white and blue colonies, indicating that instability or loss of the plasmid DNA was not the cause of white colonies. Only 577.9 U of activity could be detected from log-phase <highlight><italic>L. gasseri</italic></highlight>::pTRK570 cultures, still only approximately one-fifth the activity expressed by <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>containing the Lactobacillus GUS expressed from a lower copy-number plasmid. These data support the use of the <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>gusA gene as a more efficient reporter of gene expression than the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>gusA gene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> In order to compare the functional pH ranges of the <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>and the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>GUS enzymes, cell-free extracts from log-phase <highlight><italic>L. gasseri</italic></highlight>::pWMR35 and <highlight><italic>L. gasseri</italic></highlight>::pTRK570 were assayed in buffers at various pH&apos;s (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). The results show that the <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>GUS can be detected preferentially at acidic pH&apos;s, while only the <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>enzyme is detectable in the alkaline range. These data support the use of the <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>GUS in applications where acidity may be inhibitory to other reporter enzymes like green fluorescent protein or <highlight><italic>E. coli </italic></highlight>GUS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> In addition, the use of <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>GUS as a food grade marker is supported by its inactivity at colonic pH ranges, typically in the neutral range in the small intestin. The data on GUS from <highlight><italic>L. gasseri</italic></highlight>, suggest that the Lactobacillus enzyme would not be active in vivo. At physiological pH ranges, the enterobacterial enzyme would appear to be the major contributor to colonic &bgr;-glucuronidase activity. The relative activities of the two GUS enzymes at varying pH appears consistent with the observations of Pedrosa, Golner, Bolding, Barakat, Dallal, and Russell (<highlight><italic>Am. J. Clin.Nutr </italic></highlight>61:353-359; 1995) that feeding of elderly subjects with live cells of GUS&plus; <highlight><italic>L. gasseri </italic></highlight>ADH, significantly lowered the total level of B-glucuronidase assayed in the fecal contents. The collective data, therefore, suggests that feeding ADH lowered the major GUS activity contributed by <highlight><italic>E. coli. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
