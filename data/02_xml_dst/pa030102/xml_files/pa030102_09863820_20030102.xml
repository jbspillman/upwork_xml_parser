<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a positive electrode active material for a non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery that is currently commercially available uses LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>as a positive electrode active material and a carbon material as a negative electrode active material. Charge-discharge capacity of a non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery usually depends on the active materials used for the positive and negative electrodes. Therefore, an active material that can provide greater capacity to a battery has been sought. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Recently, an amorphous material has been proposed as a material to provide greater capacity than LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 11-283627). Among various materials, a manganese oxide is the most promising especially for use as a positive electrode active material because of raw material cost and the amount of resources (Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication Nos. 9-171817 and 11-297323, and J. J. Xu et al., Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters, 1, 1-3 (1998) et al.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> However, the amorphous manganese oxide proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 11-297323 includes K (potassium). When the manganese oxide is used as a positive electrode material for a lithium secondary battery, K ions move between a positive electrode and a negative electrode together with Li ions, and adversely affect discharge potential and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The amorphous manganese oxide proposed in Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters, 1, 1-3 (1998) and Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 9-171817 has a great discharge capacity when it is used as an active material for a lithium secondary battery, but improvement of load characteristics is required. That is, a battery having the amorphous manganese oxide does not have a great discharge capacity with regular current because the load characteristics of the amorphous manganese oxide are not as good as LiCOO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A portion of Mn in a Mn oxide is replaced with an element M to increase load characteristics in a positive electrode active material in the present invention. It is believed that substitution with M changes the electronic structure in the Mn oxide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The complex oxide comprising Mn and M is prepared by an aqueous redox sol-gel method in an aqueous solution such as that for preparing amorphous manganese oxide as described in Electrochemical and Solid-State Letters, 1, 1-3 (1998) and Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 9-171817, and incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A mole ratio of Mn and the substitutive element M (Mn:M) is preferably in a range of 99:1&tilde;70:30. When the amount of M is less than the above range, the effect, i.e., increase of load characteristics, obtained by the substitution with M, is not satisfactory, and when M is more than the above range, the discharge capacity of the battery is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Among the elements described above, Ni and Fe are especially preferred as M. When these elements are partially substituted for Mn, the load characteristics of a battery of the present invention can be improved more than with the other elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery of the present invention includes a positive electrode having the positive electrode active material of the present invention, a negative electrode and a non-aqueous electrolyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Materials for a secondary battery, except for the positive electrode active material, that are convenient and known can be used for the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery of the present invention without limitation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As a negative electrode active material, lithium metal; a lithium alloy which can occlude or release lithium ion, for example, lithium-aluminum alloy, lithium-lead alloy, lithium-tin alloy, lithium-silicon alloy, and the like; a carbon material, for example, graphite, coke, calcined organic matter, and the like; and a metal oxide having a potential lower than that of the positive electrode active material, for example, SnO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, SnO, TiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and Nb<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, can be illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As a solvent of the nonaqueous electrolyte, a high boiling point solvent, for example, ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), vinylene carbonate (VC), butylene carbonate (BC), and the like, and a mixture of the high boiling point solvent and a low boiling point solvent, for example, dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), 1,2-diethoxyethane (DEE), 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), and the like can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Lithium ion can be initially included either in a positive electrode or a negative electrode in a non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery of the present invention. When the lithium ion is initially included in the negative electrode, a secondary battery can be discharged at an initial stage. When the lithium ion is initially included in the positive electrode, a secondary battery can be discharged after charging. </paragraph>
