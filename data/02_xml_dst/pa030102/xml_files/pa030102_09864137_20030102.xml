<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to logic circuits utilized in data processing systems. More particularly, the present invention includes an improved adder circuit used in various of the functional components contained in a computer system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> With the continual advance of computer technology, more and more circuitry is being provided on each integrated circuit (IC), which makes them correspondingly more complex. All aspects of the computer system, such as operating system and application software, system hardware, circuit design and the like are influenced by this ever increasing demand for higher performance. In the area of circuit design, new technologies have been developed to create more efficient integrated circuits in terms of speed and power consumption. One such technology is referred to as silicon-on-insulator (SOI). Basically, SOI refers to placing a thin layer of silicon on top of an insulator such as silicon oxide or glass. That transistors would then be built on top of this thin layer of SOL The basic idea is that the SOI layer will reduce the capacitance of the switch, so it will operate faster. Due to the fact that the semiconductor sits on an insulator, the voltage drop across the transistor tends to vary. This situation is often referred to as the floating body effect and can have an effect on the switching times of SOI devices. Additionally, it has been discovered that N-channel type devices can experience scaling problems when implemented in SOI technology. This is due to the fact that N-type typically have a significant amount of electrical charge stored in the body of the device. As used herein, scaling refers to the ability of applying successive generations of process technology to the same circuit design. Based on the above, it can be seen that it would be advantageous to minimize the number of N-type devices that are present in SOI circuits. Further, it would be beneficial to balance any N-type devices with P-type devices such that the circuit configuration is symmetrical. That is, for sum circuits the N-type and corresponding P-type devices are on at the same time to minimize the floating body effect in SOI circuits, while for carry circuits the N-type and corresponding P-type devices would be on or off respectively to improve SOI performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In addition to scaling problems, the prior art often places too much dependence on gate voltage as a factor in increasing circuit speed. More specifically, in conventional circuits, such as Complementary Pass gate Logic (CPL), when a logic &ldquo;1&rdquo; is pushed through the source/drain of an N-channel type device, only a voltage of VDD&minus;Vtn (VDD minus Vtn) is created at the other end (drain/source respectively), where Vtn is the threshold voltage of N-channel device. This Vtn voltage is restored through an inverter having a weak P-channel and strong N-channel type devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The speed of CPL circuit is very dependent on the &ldquo;high&rdquo; voltage that is applied to the gate of N-channel device to turn it on (conduct electricity) because of the following reasons: a) the higher the voltage applied to the gate, the harder (fast and distinct switching) the N-channel device is turned on and hence, the resistance is less and so is the RC component; b) the higher voltage applied at the gate, the higher the VDD&minus;Vth voltage is with respect to the voltage appearing that the other end of the transistor (i.e. source or drain, respectively); and c) the higher the voltage VDD&minus;Vtn, the easier it is to create a logic &ldquo;0&rdquo; at the output of the inverter because the &verbar;Vgs&verbar; of the N-channel device of the driving inverter is bigger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The above described process means that the higher the &ldquo;high&rdquo; voltage in CPL circuits causes faster switching times. The converse is also true. That is, the lower the &ldquo;high&rdquo; voltage applied at the gate creates an avalanche effect, making the CPL circuit much slower. In the extreme case, if the VDD&minus;Vtn voltage drops too much, it cannot even change the state of the inverter to create a logic &ldquo;0&rdquo; output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> On the chip, there are many sources that can cause the &ldquo;high&rdquo; voltage to be at a lower voltage level, such as couple noise, delta-I noise, and dc voltage drop. Further, with respect to SOI circuits, where the semiconductor sits on an insulator, the voltage drop across a transistor tends to vary. This situation is often referred to as the floating body effect (history effect) and can have a significant impact on the switching times of SOI devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The above description demonstrates the problems that can be encountered when modeling SOI circuits which in turn makes predicting circuit speeds difficult. As the result, the speed at which the device including the SOI circuits, such as a microprocessor, is expected to operate is difficult to determine with any certainty. As noted above, scaling means applying successive generations of process technology to the same circuit design. Unfortunately, for conventional SOI circuits, successive generations of process technology tends to mean that supply voltages (VDD) will be lower. Those skilled in the art will understand that supply voltages tend to become lower as process technology advances. Because of this fact, the speed of SOI circuits using complementary pass gate logic does not scale well when compared to other circuit families. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Thus, it would be beneficial to have circuits that are scaled well with successive generations of process technology wherein the circuit switching speed is not so dependent to gate voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Adder circuits have been a major building block of computer systems for many years. In basic terms, adders are generally used to add two binary numbers and output the sum digit and a carry digit. Typically, the sum and carry digits are added to a subsequent stage and the process continues until all of the bits representing the numbers being added are summed. Several types of adders are widely known, including ripple carry adders, carry propagate adders and carry save adders (CSA). It is well known in the art that multipliers operate by performing multiple add and shift operations. Multipliers are often a component of an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) included in an execution unit of a microprocessor. For example, a fixed point, or integer unit in a microprocessor core that executes arithmetic instructions, such as multiply, add, divide, will include adders. Carry save adders are commonly used in high speed multipliers where they are generally able to function more rapidly than the other types of adders mentioned above. This is due to the fact that a CSA does not completely perform the relatively time consuming process of combining carries with sum bits between successive additions in the multiplication process, but instead defers this task until the final cycle of the multiplying operation. Typically, the partial products generated at each stage are then summed by carry save adders. The equations of sum and carry are outlined as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>sum<highlight><italic>&equals;a&prime;b&prime;c&plus;ab&prime;c&prime;&plus;a&prime;bc&prime;&plus;abc</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>carry<highlight><italic>&equals;a&prime;bc&plus;ab&prime;c&plus;abc&prime;&plus;abc</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> From these equations it can be seen that both true and complement signals are needed. Conventional techniques provide a circuit that generates a true signal and then merely adds an inverter to its output to generate the complement signal. Those skilled in the art will understand that the timing of these signals is such that the true signal will always be available before the complement signal. Thus, the true signal will have to be latched for a period of time while the complement signal develops. This not only causes increase time for the sum and carry to be generated, but also adds complexity to the design, since an accumulator, or the like must be included to store the signals while the complement develops. Further, conventional dual rail circuits, such as dual dynamic or dual rail regenerative cross-couple (RCPL) circuits have been used as adders. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the design of dynamic circuits requires special attention must be given to the macro interfaces and clocking due to the timing considerations. Further, RCPL circuits do not scale well with the new technologies, e.g SOI, particularly in the area of power distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it can be seen that it would be beneficial to have a static adder circuit that generated both the true and complement signals and made them available for processing the same time. That is, it would be advantageous to have a simultaneous dual rail (true and complement) circuit that generates the true and complement signals concurrently so they are available for processing in accordance with equations (1) and (2), above. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In contrast to the prior art, the present invention is a simultaneous dual rail, static, full adder circuit that balances the N-type and P-type devices to enhance the SOI technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Broadly, the present invention is an adder circuit that generates the sum and sum complement (sum_) signals by constructing the logic in such a way that at the first two levels both the N-type devices and P-type devices are on at the same when that leg is to be open. The logic is then determined by a third level and only one P or N type device is on at a given time. For carry and carry complement (carry_) signals a circuit is provided that is symmetrical with respect to P and N devices. Thus, carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>is generated by inputting the complement signals to a mirror of the same circuit used to generate the carry signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in accordance with the previous summary, objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to one skilled in the art from the subsequent description and the appended claims taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> typical data processing system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is shown which may be used in conjunction with the present invention. A central processing unit (CPU) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include, for example, a PowerPC microprocessor, commercially available from the IBM Corporation or a Pentium class microprocessor, available from Intel Corporation interconnected to the various other system components by a system bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> An execution unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is shown as being included in CPU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Such execution units are basically arithmetic logic units (ALU) that perform the logical and arithmetic operations used by the microprocessor to run the software programs operating on CPU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Read only memory (ROM) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connected to CPU <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and includes the basic input/output system (BIOS) that controls the basic computer functions.

I/O adapter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be a small computer system interface (SCSI) adapter that communicates with a disk storage device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Communications adapter <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be a network card that interconnects bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with an outside network. Adapter <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may also include an I/O port that allows a connection to be made, through a modem <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, or the like to enable the data processing system to communicate with other such systems via the Internet, or other communications network (LAN, WAN). User input/output devices are also connected to system bus <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via user interface adapter <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and display adapter <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>.

In this manner, a user is capable of inputting to the system through keyboard <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, trackball <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or mouse <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and receiving output from the system via speaker <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and display <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Additionally, an operating system (OS) <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, such as the DOS, OS/2, Windows operating system, or the like is shown running on CPU <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and used to coordinate the functions of the various components shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> carry save adder (CSA) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is shown having full adder circuits <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Each of these adder circuits receive three (3) inputs X<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1</subscript></highlight>, Z<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1</subscript></highlight>; X<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>, Z<highlight><subscript>n</subscript></highlight>; and X<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, Z<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, respectively. Adders, <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> each also have two (2) outputs, C<highlight><subscript>0</subscript></highlight>, S<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1</subscript></highlight>; C<highlight><subscript>n&minus;1</subscript></highlight>, S<highlight><subscript>n&minus;2</subscript></highlight>; and C<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, S<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>, respectively. CSA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> consists of n disjoint full adders and consumes three input value and produces two outputs, i.e. sum (S) and carry (C). Unlike other types of adders, e.g. ripple carry adders, carry lookahead adder and the like, the CSA contains no carry propagation. Consequently , the CSA has the same propagation delay as one full adder. As noted above, the CSA of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is likely to be used in a multiplier circuit found in one of the execution units <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of CPU <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> shows the critical path (longest delay) of this circuit travels through four carry save adders, e.g. <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. In each of these CSA cells, the sum and the carry are generated by equations (1) and (2), as previously shown </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The sum circuit, subsequently described in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which executes equation (3) and the carry circuits described below with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> that execute equation (4) both need the true and complement inputs (a and a&prime;, b and b&prime;, c and c&prime;). Since the circuits shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are symmetrical with respect to the true and complement inputs, whichever input signal, either true or complement that arrives last will determine the timing of the critical path. In other words, if both true and complement input signals arrive at the same time the critical path will be determined by both the true and complement inputs. However, in the single rail version, each CSA cell in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> would need an inverter to generate the complement signal (e.g. a&prime;) from the true signal (e.g. a), or vice versa. Since there are four CSAs in series in the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, then there are four inverters in the critical path which are used to generate the complement. It can be seen that these series inverters will cause timing delays which force the output signals to wait while the signal is inverted to generate the true/complement output signals for use at the next stage, where the delay is again encountered due to its CSA&apos;s inverter. Further, this delay increases in proportion to the number of CSA stage provided in the circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In simultaneous dual rail circuits, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, both the true and complement outputs (sum and sum&prime;, carry and carry&prime;) are generated at the same time and provided as inputs to the next CSA stage. Since an inverter is not needed to generate the complement in dual rail circuits, they can be removed from the CSA cell. In the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, four inverters, and their associated delay, are taken out of the critical path when the dual rail inputs (both true and complement) are provided to the CSA in the first stage of the circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> More particularly, it can be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> that the true and complement inputs are provided to the first stage CSAs, such as shown by CSA <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. In this case the signals a/a_, b/b_and c/c_are provided with a corresponding carry/carry_and sum/sum<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>output therefrom. Without the dual rail characteristic of the present invention, a single carry and sum output would be provided with a corresponding inverter (and its associated timing delay) that would provide the carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>and sum<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>signals, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it can be seen how the dual rail aspect of the sum and carry circuit of the present invention will increase performance by eliminating delay associated with the inclusion of an inverter which is necessary to generate complement signals when utilizing single rail circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a sum circuit included in one of full adders (FA) <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of CSA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The sum circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which generates the sum and sum complement signals, is structured as three (3) levels. The logic is constructed in a way that at levels 1 and 2 (c_b, inc and b_b, inb) both the N and P devices are &ldquo;on&rdquo; at the same for one leg, if that leg is to be open. The logic (output of sum and sum_) is determined by the third level inputs (a<highlight><subscript>13 </subscript></highlight>b, ina). With this structure, one and only one device (either P or N) is on. It should be noted that for the purposes of describing the present invention, ina, inb and inc are used to represent the input signals a, b, c. Further, a_b, b_b, c_b are used herein to represent the complement of a, b, c. For example, a_b is the complement of signal a, where &ldquo;b&rdquo; is used to represent the underscore, i.e. &ldquo;a bar&rdquo; where the &ldquo;b&rdquo; stands for bar, or underscore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> At levels 1 and 2, P devices always have inputs that are inverted from the ones of the N devices. At the third level both P and N type devices have the same input. More particularly, level 1 includes P type devices <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and N type devices <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. Those skilled in the art will understand that P type devices include transistors that conduct electricity through their source and drain when a ground potential (logical 0) is present at its gate. N type devices include transistors that conduct electricity through their source and drain when a voltage (logical 1) is present at its gate. Level 2 includes P type devices <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and N type devices <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The operation of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will now be described. It can be seen that the P type devices shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> have corresponding, or associated, N type devices such that the P and N transistors are connected symmetrically. In level 1, P devices <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> are coupled with corresponding N devices <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, respectively. The input signals to the set of P devices alternates between c_b and c, while the input to the N devices alternates between c and c_b. In this manner, the devices of level 1 are symmetrical such that for a combination of c and c_b, each P device that is turned on (logical 0 input) its corresponding N device will also be turned on (logical 1 input). For a specific example, assume that inc&equals;0 and c_b&equals;1. In this case P type transistor <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will have a logical 1 at its gate and N type transistor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> will have logical 0 input to its gate. Thus, both corresponding P and N type transistors <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> will be off. For P and N transistors <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, a logical 0 (inc) will be input to P type device <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and a logical 1 (c_b) will be input to N type device <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. In this case, both P and N type device <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> will be turned on. Similarly, for transistors <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, a logical 1 will be input to P type transistor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and logical 0 input to N type transistor <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. This causes both P and N transistors to be turned off. Finally, with a logical 0 (inc) input to P type transistor <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and a logical 1 (c_b) input to N type transistor <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> both of these corresponding transistors will be turned on. Thus, it can be seen that for level 1, each N and P device have a corresponding P and N device that will mirror its operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In level 2, P devices <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> are coupled with corresponding N devices <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, respectively. The input signals to the set of P devices alternates between b_b and b, while the input to the N devices alternates between b and b_b. In this manner, the devices of level 2 are symmetrical such that for a combination of b and b_b, each P device that is turned on (logical 0 input) its corresponding N device will also be turned on (logical 1 input). For a specific example, assume that inb&equals;0 and b_b&equals;1. In this case P type transistor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> will have a logical 1 at its gate and N type transistor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> will have logical 0 input to its gate. Thus, both corresponding P and N type transistors <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> will be off. For P and N transistors <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, a logical 0 (inb) will be input to P type device <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and a logical 1 (b_b) will be input to N type device <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. In this case, both P and N type device <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> will be turned on. Similarly, for transistors <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, a logical 1 will be input to P type transistor <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and logical 0 input to N type transistor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. This causes both P and N transistors to be turned off. Finally, with a logical 0 (inb) input to P type transistor <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and a logical 1 (b_b) input to N type transistor <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> both of these corresponding transistors will be turned on. Thus, as with level 1, it can be seen that for level 2, each N and P device have a corresponding P and N device that will mirror its operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> For level 3, P transistor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and N transistor <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> each receive the a complement signal (a_b) and P transistor <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and corresponding N transistor <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> receive the a signal (ina). Since level 3 determines the logical output of the sum circuit, the associated N and P devices will not necessarily be on or off at the same time. For example, when ina&equals;0 and a_b&equals;1, P device <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will be off (logical 1 input) and N device <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> will be on (logical 1 input). Similarly, P device <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> will be on (logical 0 input) and N device <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> will be off (logical 0 input). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Next, an example of the sum circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will be provided using various inputs for a, b and c. The truth table for this circuit is provided below.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> For the case where a, b, c, are all equal to logical 0, the input to N type transistors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> (inc and inb) is logical zero and these devices will be turned off. Correspondingly, the input to P devices <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (b_b and c_b) will be a logical 1 and these transistors will also be turned off. Thus, there is not an electrically conductive path through these transistors (<highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The input to P transistors <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is logical zero (inc and inb) and these devices will be turned on, and the input to N devices <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> (c_b and b_b) will be a logical 1 and these transistors will also be turned on. Thus, an electrically conductive path does exist through transistors (<highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A logical one will be input to P type transistors <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (b_b and c_b) such that they remain turned off, while a logical 0 is input to N type transistors <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (inc and inb) causing them to also be turned off. Therefore, an electrically conductive path is not present through transistors, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> For the case of P type transistors <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> a logical 0 (inb and inc) will be input thereto causing them to be in a turned on condition. A logical 1 (c_b and b_b) will be input to transistors <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> such that they will also be turned on. In this instance, an electrically conductive path is present through transistors <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Next, at level 3, a logical 1 (a_b) is input to P transistor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and N transistor <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. This input signal will cause transistor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to remain in a nonconductive state, but cause N transistor <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to be turned on and conduct electricity. A logical 0 (ina) is input to P type device <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and N device <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>. This reference voltage input will cause transistor <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> to be turned on and conduct electricity while transistor <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> remains in a non-conductive state. Thus, associated transistors <highlight><bold>880</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> will be on, or off, at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it can be seen that with the inputs signals a&equals;b&equals;c&equals;0, the P transistors <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> are turned on creating an electrical path from Vdd to node <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> such that sumb is pulled up to Vdd and a logical one is output. Also, N transistors <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> are turned on and will conduct electricity thereby pulling node <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> down to ground potential and cause the sum output to be a logical 0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> For the case where a&equals;b&equals;c&equals;1, P type transistors <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> will all have a logical 0 input to them (a_b, b_b, c_b) and be in a turned on state. Thus, node <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> will be pulled up to Vdd and a logical one will be output. At the same time, N type transistors <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> will have a logical one input causing them to be in a turned on state which will pull node <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> down to ground. In this case, sum will be a logical 1 and sumb will be a logical 0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Thus, it can be seen that a full complementary, static, dual rail, sum and sum<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>circuit is provided in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention which allows less variability in Vdd voltage levels that improves the floating body issues present with silicon on insulator circuit technology. Further, the switching performance is improved by having the transistors connected symmetrically, wherein all P type devices and their associated N type devices are either on or off at the same time. The dual rail aspect of the invention lies in its ability to generate the sum and sum<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>signals simultaneously on two output nodes, e.g. <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> full complementary, static, carry circuit in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown and will now be described. Again, it can be seen that the P type devices and N type devices are symmetrical with one another which will greatly improve the floating body problem associated with SOI circuits. More particularly, in level 1, P type devices <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> are included and symmetrically placed with N type devices <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> in the carry circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In Level 2, P type devices <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> are symmetrically placed in accordance with N type devices <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Further, the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> also outputs a carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>signal wherein the P type devices and N type devices are symmetrical with one another. At level 1, P type devices <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are in symmetrical connection with N type devices <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. At level 2, P type devices <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are symmetrical with N type devices <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will understand that the carry equation can also be written in the following form. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>carry<highlight><italic>&equals;ab&plus;bc&plus;ca</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(3) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The carry and carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> will implement the carry operation in the manner as described by equation (3) and is symmetrical with respect to the number of included P and N type devices. Thus, the carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>signal is generated by simply inverting all of the inputs in the used to generate the carry signal. That is, the carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>portion of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> mirrors the carry portion, i.e. they are structurally the same, with the input values being inverted with respect to one another. Typically, nine (9) partial products need five (5) CSAs to sum the values. The carry and carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>outputs are generated faster than the sum and sum<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>outputs since the sum and sum<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> includes three levels, while the carry and carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> has two levels. Thus, the carry and carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>outputs should be connected to the ina and a_b inputs to the next carry save adder, respectively. This will reduce the number of delay stages by four. Note that for the CSAs in the first stage, the true and complement may have to be generated locally by the inverters. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> As an example of the operation of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, assume that the a&equals;1, b&equals;0 and c&equals;0 are used as inputs. In this manner, a logical 0 (a_b) will be input to P transistor <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and N transistor <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and a logical 1 (b_b) will be provided to P transistor <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and N transistor <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>. The inputs to remaining P transistors <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> will all be a logical 1 (b_b and c_b). Similarly, N transistors <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> will also have a logical 1 as their input (b_b and c_b). However, N transistor <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> will have a logical 0 (a_b) input thereto causing it to be turned off. Therefore, P type transistors <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> will all be in a nonconductive state, while N type transistors <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> will all be turned on and conduct electricity since a logical 1 (b_b and c_b) are input thereto. For this case, node <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> will be pulled to ground potential and the carry bit output from the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> will be 0, in accordance with the truth table shown above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Next, the operation of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> with respect to the carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>output will now be described using the same assumptions described above, i.e. a&equals;1, b&equals;0, c&equals;0. Thus, a logical 1 (ina) will be input to P transistor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and N transistor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a logical 0 (inb) will be provided to P transistor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and N transistor <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The inputs to remaining P transistors <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> will all be a logical 0 (inb and inc). Similarly, N transistors <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> will also have a logical 0 as their input (inb and inc). Since N transistor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has a logical 1 (ina) input thereto it will be turned on and conduct electricity. To summarize, P type transistors <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> will all have a logical 0 input thereto and be in a conductive state, while N type transistors <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> will all be turned off and be in a nonconductive state since a logical 0 (inb and inc) are input thereto. For this case, node <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> will be pulled up to the Vdd voltage level through P transistors <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> such that the carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>bit output from node <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> will be a 1, in accordance with the truth table shown above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that conventional carry/carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>circuits will typically add an inverter to the output of node <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (carry) to generate the carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>signal. It can be seen that this is not a true complementary circuits, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, since the carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>signal will always follow the carry signal causing increased switching times and decreased performance. However, the present invention provides a full complementary, dual rail carry/carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>output circuit which simultaneously generates the carry and carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>signals for use in the CSA of the present invention. The dual rail aspect being in that the carry and carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>circuits are generated simultaneously on two output nodes, e.g. <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Thus, it can be seen that a full complementary, static, dual rail, sum and sum<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>circuit is provided in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention which allows less variability in Vdd voltage levels and improves the floating body issues present with silicon on insulator circuit technology. Further, the switching performance is improved by having the transistors connected symmetrically, wherein all P type devices and their associated N type devices are on or off, respectively at the same time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates another preferred embodiment of the full complementary, static, dual rail, carry and carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>circuit of the present invention which is structured in a manner similar to the sum and sum<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> provides advantages in that its structure is similar to the sum and sum<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> which may allow easier manufacturing. For certain applications this advantage may be offset by the fact that three (3) levels are present in the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, while there are only two (2) levels present in the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, which may allow the generation of the carry and carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>signal to be faster. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In order to describe the operation of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> the same input assumptions will be used as those used in conjunction with the carry and carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>circuits of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, i</cross-reference>.e. a&equals;1, b&equals;0, c&equals;0. With regard to level 1 of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> logical 0 (inc) will be input to P type transistor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and N type transistor <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, with a logical 1 (c_b) being input to P type transistor <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and N type transistor <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. At level 2, P type transistors <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and N type transistors <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> will each receive a logical 1 (b_b). A logical 0 (inb) signal will be input to P type device <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and N type device <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. At level 3, a logical 0 (a_b) will be input to P type device <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and N type device <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. Therefore, it can be seen that N type transistors <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> will both be turned on to conduct electricity and node <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> will be pulled down to ground potential such that the carry bit output will be a logical 0 in accordance with the truth table shown in Table 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The generation of the carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>signal by the circuit shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> will now be described. At level 1, a logical 1 (c_b) will be input to P transistor <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and N transistor <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>, with a logical 0 (inc) being input to P transistor <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> and N transistor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. At level 2, P type transistors <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> and N type transistors <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight> will each receive a logical 0 (inb). A logical 1 (b_b) signal will be input to P type device <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> and N type device <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight>. At level 3, a logical 1 (ina) will be input to P type device <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and N type device <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. Thus, it is apparent that P type transistors <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> will both be turned on to conduct electricity and node <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> will be pulled up to voltage Vdd such that the carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>output bit will be a logical 1 in accordance with above truth table of Table 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a further embodiment of the present invention wherein transmission gate logic techniques are utilized to provide additional benefits. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that transmission gate logic includes one N type transistor and one P type transistor connected in parallel and controlled inverted gate voltages. This technology is known to provide faster speed operations than static circuit designs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> transmission gate logic carry and carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>circuit is shown having six transmission gates, also known as pass gates, for the carry generation portion and six pass gates for the carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>operation. An example will now be used to describe the operation of this circuit. For purposes of this example assume that a&equals;1, b&equals;1 and c&equals;0. From Table 2, it can be seen that given these inputs, the carry output will be equal to a logical 1 and the carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>will be a logical 0. N type transistor <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> will receive a logical 1 input (inb) with P device <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> having a logical 0 (b_) input thereto. This will cause node <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> to be pulled to ground through these transistors. At the same time, N type transistor <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and P type transistor <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> will have a logical 0 and logical 1 input to their gates, receptively, causing both to be turned off. Thus, the logical 0 (a_) input to the source of transistors <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> will not have an electrically conductive path to node <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Transistor <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> (N type device) and transistor <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> (P type device) will have a logical 1 (inb) and logical 0 (b_) input to their gates, respectively. Thus, both of these devices will be turned on and provide a conductive path to node <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, which will be at ground potential, due to the logical 0 (a_) input to the sources of transistors <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Transistor <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is an N type device that will be turned off due to the logical 0 (b_) input to its gate. Correspondingly, P type device <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> will also be turned off due to the logical 1 (inb) input to its gate. Thus node <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> will remain at logical 0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> At the next level, N type transistor <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> will be turned off due to the logical 0 (inc) input to its gate. Further P transistor <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> will also be turned off due to the logical 1 input thereto (c_). Therefore, node <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> will not have a conductive path to node <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. However, N transistor <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and P transistor <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> will both be turned on due to the logical 1 (c_) and logical 0 (inc) input to their gates, respectively. In this case, node <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> will have an electrically conductive path such that node <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> will be pulled to logical 0. Node <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is input to inverter <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and a logical 1 is output therefrom on node <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> which is the carry output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> N type transistor <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> will receive a logical 1 input (inb) with P device <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> having a logical 0 (b_) input thereto. This will cause node <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> to be pulled up to Vdd through these transistors. At the same time, N type transistor <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and P type transistor <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> will have a logical 0 and logical 1 input to their gates, receptively, causing both to be turned off. Thus, the logical 1 (ina) input to the source of transistors <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> will not have an electrically conductive path to node <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Transistor <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> (N type device) and transistor <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> (P type device) will have a logical 1 (inb) and logical 0 (b_)input to their gates, respectively. Thus, both of these devices will be turned on and provide a conductive path to node <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight>, which will be at a logical 1, due to the input (ina) to the sources of transistors <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. Transistor <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> is an N type device that will be turned off due to the logical 0 (b_) input to its gate. Correspondingly, P type device <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> will also be turned off due to the logical 1 (inb) input to its gate. Thus node <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> will remain at logical 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> At the next level, N type transistor <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> will be turned off due to the logical 0 (inc) input to its gate. Further P transistor <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight> will also be turned off due to the logical 1 input thereto (c_). Therefore, node <highlight><bold>331</bold></highlight> will not have a conductive path to node <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. However, N transistor <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and P transistor <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> will both be turned on due to the logical 1 (c_) and logical 0 (inc) input to their gates, respectively. In this case, node <highlight><bold>333</bold></highlight> will have an electrically conductive path such that node <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> will be pulled to logical 1. Node <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> is input to inverter <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and a logical 0 is output therefrom on node <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> which is the carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the carry and carry<highlight><subscript>&mdash; </subscript></highlight>portions of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, which provide the dual rail characteristic of the present invention, are symmetrical with respect to one another. As discussed above, this will reduce the floating body effect associated with SOI circuits and enhance the performance of functional units (i.e. multiplier with CSAs) using this design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Although certain preferred embodiments have been shown and described, it should be understood that many changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
