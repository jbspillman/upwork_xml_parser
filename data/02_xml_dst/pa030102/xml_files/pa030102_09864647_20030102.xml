<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system for managing one or more procedures in a blood collection facility is disclosed. The system includes a blood collection instrument for collecting a blood component from a blood donor. The blood donor has a blood donor identifier, and the blood collection instrument has a blood collection instrument identifier. The system further includes a blood collection kit having a blood collection kit identifier. The blood collection kit is operably connected to the blood donor and the blood collection instrument. A system server is also included. The system server is operably responsive to the blood collection instrument and comprises a program having a plurality of segments defining a blood collection process. The program is capable of monitoring a status of the blood collection kit. The system further comprises an operator interface which is operably connected to the system server. The operator interface has a reader for entering information to be transmitted to the system server and integrated into the program. A display unit is included for monitoring the process. The system also has a blood collection process number associated with the blood collection kit, the blood collection instrument and the blood donor, and a label for identifying the status of the blood collection kit. The label is readable by the reader of the operator interface. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Blood component therapy is a popular method of treating medical conditions or diseases. Components may be removed from a patient&apos;s blood circulation to eliminate unhealthy components. Blood components may also be inventoried for future transfusion into an ailing patient. Rather than transfusing a patient with whole blood, the patient is given packed red cells, platelets, or plasma depending on the condition that is being treated. For example, a patient suffering from anemia needs red cells, and treating that same patient with whole blood would be wasteful and could actually be detrimental to the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Blood components are removed from a patient&apos;s/donor&apos;s blood circulation by a process called apheresis. The removal of red cells and white cells is called cytapheresis or hemapheresis; removal of plasma is called plasmapheresis; and removal of platelets is called plateletpheresis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> During apheresis, I.V. lines are inserted into a donor&apos;s/patient&apos;s veins. Blood is drawn from the veins and transferred to a cell separator machine where it is spun in a centrifuge to separate the components of the blood for collection. The speed of the centrifuge can be varied to isolate specific components by their density. Unneeded components are transferred back to the patient and reinfused. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There are a number of facilities/organizations that are specifically set up to collect blood and blood components. Tracking donors, component handling, donor registrations, and the like are important aspects of the blood component collection industry. However, the blood component collection industry has long recognized a void in the automation of collection processes at collection centers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For instance, the current blood donation process generally comprises the following steps. First, when the donor arrive at the facility, he/she checks in at the front desk. The donor&apos;s paper chart is pulled, and his/her DMS record is pulled and checked. Next, the donor signs in, his/her weight is measured, and the weight is recorded on the paper chart. A name tag with a barcode is printed for the donor. The donor proceeds to a screening area where he/she is asked a series of medical questions. The answers given by the donor are recorded on the paper chart (new donors have additional questions). The donor&apos;s vital signs are taken, and these results are recorded on the paper chart as well. A small blood sample is taken from the donor and the protein level is measured. Again, these results are entered on the donor&apos;s chart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Next, the donor proceeds to a waiting room where he/she waits to be called to a control desk. At this time, the donor&apos;s DMS record is updated with information from the paper chart. The collection facility designates a blood collection container and a blood collection kit for the donor. Bleed numbers are taken from a roll of preprinted barcode labels. There are three rolls of labels, each having different number ranges representing different blood types. The donor&apos;s name, donor number, and the date are printed on the appropriate label. Many labels are produced for each donor. One label goes on the donor&apos;s chart and several are applied to the collection bottle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Finally, the donor is escorted with his/her chart and collection bottle/kit to an assigned bed where the donor&apos;s blood is drawn. The actual volume of blood drawn from the donor is manually recorded on the collection bottle. After the donation is completed, the donor&apos;s chart and the full blood container are transported to a processing desk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Most blood center operators have managed to automate processes such as donor registration, blood sample, and product handling but are unable to do much about the record keeping and tracking of the blood collection process itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The ability of the centers to automate blood collection data depends on the built-in data communication capability of the blood or blood component collection device. Unfortunately, most collection devices currently in use in this field have very rudimentary and/or proprietary data communication interfaces. This makes the task of connecting the devices to standard computing equipment cost prohibitive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For example, some of these devices transmit periodic binary data out of a proprietary pin-type interface. The periodic data rate and the maximum burst rate of these devices often approach or exceed the limits of most serial networks. Thus, in order to connect these existing collection devices to a serial network, new adaptor hardware, which is capable of interfacing with the proprietary interface of the collection device, is needed. Moreover, such a hardware add-on would require a communication driver for the host computer that receives the data from the collection device. This aspect would be even more complicated when high level messaging protocols are utilized for the communication. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Healthcare devices have been included in computer networks. For instance U.S. Pat. No. 5,857,967 (Frid et al.) is directed to a healthcare device which comprises a web server and medical information thereon, and which generates HTML files on the fly for providing such information to a client at a remote location using a standard browser interface. The healthcare device of the &apos;967 patent is universally accessible via a communication network using open standard network protocols. The healthcare device includes the web server that exchanges messages with web clients using the HTTP and HTML open standard protocols on the communication network. The web server handles HTTP commands received via the communication network that specify a predetermined Universal Resource Locator (URL) for the healthcare device. The HTTP commands are used by web clients such as a web browser to read medical information including measurement data and optional related information from the healthcare device. The web server packages the medical information into the HTML format and transfers the information to requesting web clients on the communication network using the HTTP protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,891,035 (Wood et al.) is directed to an ultrasonic diagnostic imaging system. The imaging system is capable of accessing images and information from internal and external databases by means of a web browser. Access to the images or information may be over a local network or over the Internet. The browser may be used to pull in system preset data or reference images from a reference image library. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> While this invention is susceptible of embodiments in many different forms, there are shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail, preferred embodiments of the invention with the understanding that the present disclosures are to be considered as exemplifications of the principles of the invention and are not intended to limit the broad aspects of the invention to the embodiments illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to an apparatus or system for collecting, using, and storing information in a biological fluid collection and/or processing facility (&ldquo;facility&rdquo;). The present invention can be incorporated into an existing facility&apos;s system via an upgrade to existing hardware and software. The present apparatus provides a data connection between laboratory instruments, including, but not limited to, existing blood and blood component collection instruments, such as the Autopheresis-C instrument which is supplied by the Fenwal Division of Baxter International, Inc. located in Deerfield, Ill., those described in PCT Publication No. WO 01/17584, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,581,687 and 5,956,023, and U.S. Ser. No. 09/037,356, and biological treatment instruments, such as the pathogen inactivation instruments described in U.S. Ser. No. 09/325,599, which are all assigned to Baxter International, Inc. and are incorporated by reference herein, and the collection facility&apos;s management information system which lends itself to automated tracing and/or tracking of donors and biological fluids data logging. Traceability is provided via integration of donor, operator, soft goods, and instrument data. The present invention further automates event reporting which is required for regulatory compliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The system is designed for a biological fluid collection and/or processing facility as an accessory to the instruments used in those facilities. The general purpose of the system is to increase the efficiency of processing biological fluids and aid in the regulatory compliance process. This purpose is fulfilled principally through the collection of more information and more accurate information. Currently, facility staff must manually keep track of information such as by writing information on a clipboard, but the present system allows the staff and operators to skip the paper/manual steps. The system may also provide some of the following benefits: more accuracy and completeness in the data that is already being collected manually; more data collected for diagnostic use, which may give rise to better information with which to design or troubleshoot laboratory instruments; more data collected for use by the center for generation of ad-hoc statistical reports, which could relate any number of variables such as donors per day/per time of day, rate of errors, collection amount by type of donor, etc.; more data collected for use by the center to determine the efficiency and error rate of different operators, which in turn can inform decisions to institute better training or could substantiate a complaint against a facility operator; greater efficiency on the floor, due to less paperwork; lower costs due to less office paperwork; ability to research all the detailed information on a single procedure, or on the history of a single donor, as a way to find information pertaining to a donor complaint, or something wrong with the product, or any other complaint or error; more complete records and statistical and trend reports to help ease compliance reviews; accurate monitoring of the facility procedures; collection of information that may help the facility&apos;s staff improve their efficiency/workflow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The present invention also improves collection facility workflow by providing portable data input and monitoring devices and a method for tracking soft good utilization and coordinating restocking and reordering of the soft goods through remote access service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The present invention is suited for medical facilities where product integrity and traceability are critical quality factors. Typically, the instruments, laboratory equipment, as well as data input devices are connected to an Ethernet along with other data processing applications. The present invention is also suited for connecting legacy instruments that automatically transmit or can be configured to periodically transmit data via a serial or parallel interface and protocol converters. A computer acting as a server/gateway runs applications to receive the transmitted data and route them to database and hypertext markup language (HTML) applications. Each data packet bears a unique identifier which identifies the source of the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Users can perform data query and reporting on a local area network, through a wide area network, over the Internet, or a combination of two or more of these, using a standard browser application interface. Real-time viewing and updating of device operation can be configured for any number of devices on the browser. In addition, the server also presents abbreviated data to a wireless personal digital assistant (PDA) also running a standard application browser interface for portable information and viewing and alarm and event notification. The PDAs are also used for data input (through a keypad touch screen, scanning, or other entering method&mdash;all used interchangeably herein) in association with an apparatus operation. Thus, the present invention includes open standard architecture in a heterogeneous apparatus environment with real-time update and access of data, and portable data viewing, reporting, notification, and inputting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the system/apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a first network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprising a system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> including a memory, a communication driver and an HTML application capable of running embedded javascript code and at least one wireless data interface, preferably a PDA and/or scanner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, but more preferably enough PDAs and scanners to accommodate several facility operators and/or donors at a time and a wireless access point <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In a second embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises hardware and software component parts and provides for inter-process communication. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a first network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The first network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes laboratory instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, serial/parallel to Ethernet converters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>, such as a PicoWeb&trade; device by Lightner Engineering located in San Diego, Calif. or a NetDev&trade; device by Fenwal Division of Baxter International, Inc., where needed, a first Ethernet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> including a memory, a communication driver for the apheresis instruments, a communication protocol converter, and an HTML application with embedded javascript code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The first network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can communicate via the Internet through a network switch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The network switch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which can be incorporated within the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, includes a processor which allows the switch to distinguish the sources of the information which it receives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a pair of networks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The network switch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> provides the communication link between the networks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Again, the network switch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a processor which allows the switch to distinguish the sources of the information which it receives. The first network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes laboratory instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, serial/parallel to Ethernet converters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>where needed, a first Ethernet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> including a memory, a communication driver for the instruments, a communication protocol converter, and an HTML application capable of running embedded javascript code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The second network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a second Ethernet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and data interfaces <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, e.g. personal computers to run server and browser software. At least one of the data interfaces <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is equipped with a barcode scanner for setting up facility operators and associating them with preprinted badges. The second network <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> also comprises at least one wireless data interface, preferably a PDA and/or scanner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, but more preferably enough PDAs and scanners to accommodate several facility operators and/or donors at a time and a wireless access point <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A central server <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, generally located at a remote site, may communicate with the first and second networks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via the Internet using a communication link such as a modem, digital subscriber line, or the like with the network switch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The central server <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, therefore, can access data regarding the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>that are stored in the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The first network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is primarily established between the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. This first network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not directly connected to the Internet or any other subnetwork except through the network switch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The network switch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is adapted to prevent unwanted communication with external servers and/or other means of data communication while at the same time being configured to forward useable Ethernet datagrams broadcast packets (UDP) to all ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> controls the distribution of data throughout the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> runs an operating system, such as a Linux machine running SuSE 6.4 or more preferably a personal computer running Microsoft 2000. The system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> receives data from an instrument <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>via one of the serial/parallel to Ethernet converters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and/or other interfaces within the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes one or more Ethernet cards to connect sets of apheresis instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and at least one additional Ethernet card to connect the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the facility&apos;s office network which is also connected to the central server <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> also runs a web server, such as Apache or more preferably Microsoft Internet Information Server provided with Microsoft 2000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Each instrument <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>connected to the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is identified by a unique number such as an internet protocol (IP) address and a serial number. Certain legacy instruments provide framing bytes on data packets coming through a parallel port. The serial/parallel to Ethernet converters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>gather data from the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and deliver the data into an Ethernet frame buffer. The data is transmitted via the first Ethernet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Server software takes the data and outputs web pages of information. It should be noted that the Ethernet converters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are necessary for certain legacy devices and may not be needed in every application of the present system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the instrument <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is the primary source of data for the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The instrument <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may provide parallel data packets to the serial/parallel to Ethernet converter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which converts the packets to useable Ethernet datagrams (user datagram protocol/internet protocol (UDP/IP) packets). The first Ethernet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> transmits the UDP data packets to the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The software within the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> performs two separate functions. The first function gathers data from the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. This function receives the UDP packets from the first Ethernet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The second function outputs HTML files to web clients by sending and receiving remote method invocation (RMI) data. Accordingly, the server software comprises separate modules for performing these functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> core module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, comprising a java program, communicates with the first Ethernet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and also communicates with the other modules within the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The core module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> handles access with a database module <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and caches information from the instrument <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is monitored on a frequent basis via data interface <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and/or the PDAs <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The core module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also writes to a high resolution log filing system <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and performs the bulk of the business logic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> First, the core module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> receives UDP packets from one of the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and tracks the instrument&apos;s process. A converter network protocol module contains a protocol describing network communications between the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and a converter boot procedure used in conjunction with a bootp server which contains the IP addresses for the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The bootp server contains the Internet protocol that enables a diskless workstation to discover its own IP address, the IP address of a bootp server on the network, and a file to be loaded into memory to boot the machine. This enables the workstation to boot without requiring a hard or floppy disk drive. The converter network protocol and the converter boot procedure modules are specifications and not software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The data transferred from the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to the core module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be used to create HTML web pages for monitoring the instruments via a structured query language (SQL) open database connectivity interface (ODBC). The core module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> writes to the database module <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which includes a SQL database server, to save and manage the instrument data. Javascript is used to create database tables on the SQL server and creates definitions for each table and field. The SQL database server stores all apparatus data except for high resolution logs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The SQL database server preferably uses MySQL and more preferably Microsoft SQL Server. The SQL database server saves the data into a disk array. Java code within the HTML files provides a SQL interface to the SQL database server <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A web module <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, comprising the web server, can access the SQL database server using the ODBC interface. The web module <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> serves the web pages on the second Ethernet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so that the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>on the first Ethernet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are not interfered. The second Ethernet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> allows standards such as javascript and hypertext preprocessor (PHP) codes to be viewed. The javascripts and/or PHP can be used to query and search the database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The web module <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> communicates with the core module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> via RMI data transmission. The core module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> sends RMI data to the web module <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) data generated by the web module <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are served to and received from the web browser <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>via the web module <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the second Ethernet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The web browser <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can act as a central workstation for monitoring the workflow within the blood collection facility. HTTP data can further be served to and received from the facility&apos;s donor management system (DMS) <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> A mobile module <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> controls the system server&apos;s <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> communications with the PDAs/scanners <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Thus, PDAs/scanners <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, such as the Palm Pilot&trade; by Symbol, are also a source of data to the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Preferably, each PDA/scanner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes a wireless RF link and a built-in bar code scanner. The wireless feature of the PDA/scanner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> allows the users to move freely in a room such as a blood center and scan barcoded material knowing it was logged into the database. The human error from manually writing down a number onto a log sheet is, thus, eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The core module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> communicates with the PDAs/scanners <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> via the mobile module <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> by transmitting and receiving RMI data to and from the mobile module <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The core module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can also serve data regarding the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, such as an instrument&apos;s screen display or status, to a PDA/scanner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in real time or near real time. Thus, the wireless access point <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> provides the link between the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the PDAs/scanners <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The mobile module <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> communicates HTTP data to and from the PDAs/scanners. The PDA/scanner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be used to scan the barcodes of plastic disposable kits, bleed numbers, donor ID cards, operator ID cards, and the instrument itself, and transfer that information to the core module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> via the mobile module <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Data that was historically manually recorded at blood centers can now be barcoded and logged electronically and wirelessly via the PDA/scanner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Date and time are automatically logged with such information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Finally, a downtime module contains a java program that performs downtime tasks, including software updates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The central server <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is generally located at a remote site and preferably runs a Windows 2000 operating system. The central server <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is also referred to as a headquarters (HQ) server. The central server <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is connected to facility networks through an IP network and is, therefore, necessarily more powerful than the facilities&apos; system servers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> due to the larger database size. The central server <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> must be capable of contacting any remote server at any time. There is not a wireless base station <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> or instrument <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>at the HQ level. Personal computers at the headquarters office connect to the central server <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> through HQ office network (IP). Personal computers at the facilities may also connect to the central server <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Other computer devices with a browser interface and internet/networking capability can also connect to the server with proper security passwords and/or identification. Similar to the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the central server <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> includes modules that perform predetermined functions, including a central core module <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, a central database module <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and a central web module <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In addition, the central server contains a central management module <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, a database connect file, and an installation procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The central management module <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is an interactive java program used by HQ management to perform continuous backups and software updates while the database connect file is a file containing the password for the SQL server database. The installation procedure is a procedure for installing server networking and files necessary to start the initial facility network upgrade process, including a setup program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The central database module <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> houses a database composed of all the facilities&apos; databases merged together. The central database module <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is designed to facilitate the database merge by insuring that the definitions of unique keys do not conflict. All data is collected by and lives in the facilities&apos; database modules <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. There can be many such facility database modules <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in communication with the central server <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The system servers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are the servers for all communications with the donor management systems <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Optionally, a company operating several facilities, each having its own system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, may also have a dedicated central database. This dedicated central database is equivalent to the database module <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> except: (1) many of the functions of the database module <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> cannot be used because the central server <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is not connected to any wireless devices or apheresis instruments; and (2) an additional program is needed to run the dedicated central database with the contents of the several system databases. This synchronization program communicates directly with the system servers and updates any changes from the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the central server <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In use, the facilities provide inputs to the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through an HTTP call for each procedure which is initiated from their donor management system before the system server will store data for the procedure. The facilities may issue HTTP requests for data from their system servers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for limited bleed summary fields, using a programmatic interface, in addition to the HTTP browser-based reporting interface from the central server <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The present apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be called a &ldquo;distributed system;&rdquo; however, the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> operates independently as if it were not part of a distributed system. The central or HQ server <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> takes initiative to copy data in both directions as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> always operates in server-mode with respect to communications with headquarters and other systems, and never operates in client-mode. The donor management system and the central server <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> operate in client-mode. In server mode, the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> waits for requests and does not initiate transactions with other servers. This achieves the benefits of centralizing data management functions (like backups) while retaining the robustness of independent servers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The following is an illustrative example of the functioning of a system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention. The illustrative example described herein is adapted for use in an apheresis facility; however, it should be noted that the present invention can be used in any biological fluid collection and/or processing facility without departing from the spirit of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Software </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of this embodiment includes software components for reporting, business administration, and technical facility requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Reporting </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> On the reporting end, the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides interactive reporting capability to any common computing platform, essentially web-based. Specific reports will be discussed below. The reports are intended to be optimized for on-screen viewing, but are also printable. All reports may require user selection of a location or region when accessed from the headquarters database; however, this step may be skipped when accessed from the center database. Although the report requirements below do not include the location name each time, it should be part of the header of each report. The local time zone of the database server must be known by the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and all time outputs in reports are stored and reported in the local time of the site where the facility procedure took place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Data reporting can be customized for specific time periods, e.g. by week where a week is defined as Monday-Sunday, Sunday-Saturday, etc. The total hours of instrument operation may be displayed. The total hours of instrument operation references a pre-defined table of weekly operation hours which consists of seven data items representing hours, as in this example: mon&equals;8, tue&equals;8, wed&equals;9, thu&equals;9, fri&equals;9, sat&equals;6, sun&equals;0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Other reports may reference collection and other goals compared to actual values. There must be a center-wide goal entry screen to allow data input of goals to handle these cases. Goals are different for each center, and different for each day, week, month, and year. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Business Administration </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> On the business administration end, the high resolution log is stored to get a time history, e.g. second-by-second, of an instrument&apos;s output variables. The log is filed so that it can be easily located in the file system, but not interactively within the software. The facility management has the option of turning the high-resolution logging feature on or off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The high resolution log is generally stored at one second intervals for each facility instrument while the instrument is in run mode; i.e. during a operation, and is not stored at all while not in a bleed. This is accomplished by suspending logging if the instrument&apos;s mode code remains at 1 (indicating paused or not in a operation) for more than one minute. When it changes to another value, logging is resumed. The high resolution log is stored in a FIFO-type queue as disk space permits, at least one month of logging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The following variables must be stored for each log interval: local date and time contents of the instrument&apos;s run packet (as described below). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Further to the business administration end, a medium-resolution log is stored to provide an occasional &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; of the instrument&apos;s output. The medium resolution log is stored for facility purposes and is available the generation of reports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The medium resolution log entries are generally made at these times: when any alarm/alert is issued by the instrument during any phase of a procedure; at every instrument keystroke; at every minute, if there hasn&apos;t been any log entries in the last minute, but only if the instrument is running (i.e. mode is not 1). The one-minute recording feature is controllable (on/off) at the site level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In the case of an apheresis instrument, the following variables are stored in the medium-resolution log: date/time; reservoir sensor; P1 pressure; P2 pressure; cuff pressure; M2 flow rate; plasma flow rate; cycle &num;; display; plasma volume; clamp status (4 clamps); mode code; keystrokes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The administration end also includes a setup and procedure-related log (e.g., a bleed-related log). In order to meet the purposes of cost reduction and information availability, information on each procedure is stored in an interactively available form for a period of at least two years. The facility has the option of purging old data stored at the facility level. Meanwhile, the headquarters system staff has the option of archiving old data stored at the HQ level. Every log entry includes the absolute date and time (i.e. GMT, not local time). These general data requirements apply equally to the medium resolution logs (above). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In the case of an apheresis facility, the stages of the procedure are the instrument setup, procedure-program, arm-prep, remove-plasma, and disconnect donor. Instrument setup is performed without reference to any specific donor, and is, therefore, not linked to the donor or bleed in the database, (although it may have to be linked retroactively). The bleed procedure (from procedure-program through disconnect donor) is identified by a unique bleed number provided by the facility&apos;s system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The events that are collected and logged include the those shown in Table <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In addition, the system allows event types to be added with a minimum of redesign, because the selection of events to be logged is a requirement that could conceivably change after initial testing.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In regard to Table 1, in the O/A column, an &ldquo;O&rdquo; indicates that the operator initiates the logging from a menu, and it is optional. An &ldquo;A&rdquo; indicates that the logging is a required response to an alarm/alert. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The operator is identified by a unique badge number and log-in ID. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> The &ldquo;products&rdquo; entry is a list of up to ten components of two barcode scans for each component. The first barcode identifies the product number. The second barcode identifies the lot number and expiration date. In some cases, only one component will be used, and in other cases, five will be used. The system allows up to ten for future needs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The bleed number is printed on a barcode label generated by the DMS, and is scanned only once. The bleed number is tied to all future events until the completion of the remove-plasma event occurs or any instrument-setup event occurs. If the donor is moved to a different instrument, uses a different kit, is seen by a different operator, or any other changes occur, it is still the same bleed number as long as the same collection container is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The donor is identified by unique donor number. Donor tags may be printed with a photo ID upon entry to floor, or the donor number may be scanned from a paper chart. The ID number is a constant and unique identifier for the donor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> The Apheresis instrument is identified by serial number. For the O-type events, it must be operator entered (scanned), but it is system derived for the A-type events. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> The &lsquo;action list&rsquo; for alarm/alerts is a different list for each alarm/alert type, including such items as &ldquo;check line&rdquo;, &ldquo;check pump&rdquo;, etc. The user must be able to select one or more items from the action list. The &lsquo;reason list&rsquo; works the same as action lists, but is used when a reason for an operator action is required. The &lsquo;outcome list&rsquo; works the same as action lists, but it includes occurrences following the event in question (e.g. procedure continued, terminated, etc.). There is only one customer-defined outcome list which is used for all types of log entries where listed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The &lsquo;Override log&rsquo; event is only available in recovery mode, not as a general purpose log entry. It is intended for supervisor use to log a change to an existing log entry. It does not change the bleed summary or erase any data, or change what is shown in reports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The &lsquo;Accuracy message&rsquo; log is not operator initiated. It is automatically logged when exception messages are shown as listed under &lsquo;Operational Accuracy&rsquo; requirements. It logs the message that is shown to the user without user intervention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> In addition to and separate from the log of events listed above, summary data for each bleed or partial bleed is stored. These records are not specific events, but are totals or averages over the whole bleed. The summary values are calculated either from (1) data provided by the apheresis instrument (the same data that optionally forms the high-resolution log); (2) the log of operator events; or (3) from the customer donor management system. The summary includes the following data items: bleed number, donor number, date and time of most recent instrument-setup logging, date and time donor arrived on floor (captured from donor system), date and time of arm prep logging, date and time of venipuncture logging, date and time procedure started (from apheresis machine), date and time of remove-plasma logging date and time of disconnect-donor logging, all products/lots used in the bleed, apheresis instrument (if more than one instrument, store latest instrument used), flag if more than one apheresis instrument used, operator who performed instrument-setup (if multiple, store latest), number of alarm/alerts associated with instrument-setup, number of instrument-setups performed, operator who performed the procedure program (if multiple, store latest), number of alarm/alerts associated with procedure-program, the operator who performed venipuncture (if multiple, store latest), number of alarm/alerts associated with the run, the operator who performed remove-plasma (if multiple, store latest), the operator who performed procedure-end (if multiple, store latest), total number of alarm/alerts, the latest AC rate set (it could be changed mid procedure), the total plasma volume collected as reported by the apheresis machine, total plasma volume collected as reported by the user, the remove-plasma event, target plasma volume as determined by a calculation based on the facility system, total VP time&mdash;calculated by disconnect time minus VP time, or use a value from zeropage, total AC used&mdash;based on volume of AC pumped for the current bag&plus;(number of bags used completely*volume of each bag), any overdraw&quest; (defined by site-entered value, e.g. 8% over the programmed volume), any underdraw&quest; (defined by site-entered value, e.g. 8% under the programmed volume), any no-take&quest; (defined by site-entered value, e.g. less than 100 ml) cell-loss volume (if abnormal disconnect), donor reaction&mdash;yes or no (based on the existence of a Donor- reaction event, or the donor-reaction field set in the Disconnect-donor or Procedure- termination events), reviewer, review date, review notes, whether the bleed is classified as an exception&mdash;yes or no (in order to determine this, a center-level setup function must be available to select which of these things indicates an exception: <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>nd VP, procedure termination, cell loss, donor reaction, over/under-draws, mis-programmings, &ldquo;other&rdquo;-type log entry, reboot-resync log entry, and the reason that the bleed is classified as an exception (e.g. &ldquo;cell loss&rdquo; or &ldquo;2nd VP&rdquo;). Additional fields may need to be stored in the summary in order to produce the required reports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Only the procedure-program, change-instrument, and reboot-resync associate the bleed number to a instrument. All other events event types are logged in relation to the instrument. Therefore, in order to satisfy all of the above requirements, the system tracks the events associated with the instrument(s) in use, and calculates the bleed summary based on that information. The bleed summary is be calculated after the fact without user intervention. In other words, there is not a user input required to signal the end of a bleed. For example, if a venipuncture event is recorded, and the next event for the same instrument is an instrument setup event, then it is assumed that the previous bleed ended in some unknown way (perhaps a power failure), and that the bleed summary record should be stored with incomplete information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The bleed summary has the option of an attached review (reviewer, date, and notes), which an auditor with the appropriate privileges shall be able to add and edit. The review information must be visible to all users who have access to the bleed summary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Each logged event may be edited by a supervisor who has appropriate access to the system. However, the old version of the record must also be stored and visible for comparison. Only the new edited version will be used for calculations in reports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Outside of the bleed events detailed above, the system must log these maintenance events, along with the operator who performed them, the absolute date and time, and the Apheresis machine.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> In regard to Table 2, Weight A and B for daily maintenance references two pre-defined calibration weights, such as 500 g and 1000 g, which may be customer defined. When an out-of-service event is logged, the system automatically removes the instrument from the inventory so that attempts to use it will result in the appropriate alarm/alerts as described elsewhere. However, the back-in-service event does not reinstate the instrument. This step is done separately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The system also stores the history of each instrument added to or subtracted from the facility&apos;s inventory. The inventory function is not associated with the maintenance event logging of the out-of-service and in-service events. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> For each instrument, the manufacturer identity, the model name/number, the serial number, and the enabled/disabled flag are stored. Each time an instrument is added to the inventory, the following information is also stored: the location (center), the date added, the bed number (e.g. 1, 2, 3 . . . , as opposed to the long serial number), and any notes. Each time an instrument is removed from the inventory, the following information is stored: location&mdash;from where it was removed, the date removed, and the location or description of where/why it was moved. An instrument that is not in inventory is not considered an &ldquo;authorized (or enabled) device.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The system also maintains a log of the disposable kits inventory. All disposable lots that are received by the facility are logged. The following information is stored: the product number, the lot number, the record added by the operator, the lot quantity, the lot expiration date, the date that the lot was received, whether the lot was released for use, the date that the lot was released for use, whether the lot was quarantined, if quarantined, the reason for quarantine, whether a sterilization certificate is on file, and the directions for use. Facilities may select whether they want to use the fields &ldquo;sterilization certificate on file&rdquo; and &ldquo;directions for use&rdquo; during setup. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In order to handle logging of product performance issues and reporting of products by descriptions, the following fields must be stored in a product look-up table which may be edited via a setup function: the product category&mdash;e.g. &ldquo;needles&rdquo;, &ldquo;kits&rdquo;, &ldquo;solutions&rdquo;, etc., the manufacturer&apos;s product number, the UPN (universal product number&mdash;this is the number that appears on barcodes), the product description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> In order to handle reporting of product performance issues by problem code, a lookup table of problems must exist. Each specific problem must belong to a general problem group (e.g. &ldquo;leaks in tubing&rdquo; belongs to the general group of &ldquo;leaks&rdquo;.) The lookup table is not edited by the facility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> This section details the requirements for alarm/alerts, which are messages presented to operators asynchronously, which is to say that they can occur at any time unrelated to operator inputs. (There are also warnings given in the course of operator input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> There are two general types of operator alarm/alerts: (1) alarm/alerts originating from the instrument; (2) alarm/alerts originating from the system. Alarm/alerts that have not been dismissed by an authorized operator are considered active in an alarm/alert queue. An alarm/alert may not be assumed to have been read until the operator dismisses it by some action (such as pressing an OK button). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Operators can be authorized for handling alarm/alerts on a fine-grained level by the center supervisor; i.e. each operator can be authorized for any subset of alarm/alerts. In addition, an operator may be flagged for training for a certain alarm/alert. This affects reporting only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> If an operator is not authorized to handle an alarm/alert, he can override the restriction by getting the approval of any supervisor, in the form of a badge-scan. To handle this requirement, the administrator must be able to select which operators are supervisory during setup. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Each alarm/alert type can be set up by the center supervisor to be one of three status levels: ignored, auto log, or manual log. The &lsquo;manual log&rsquo; type requires a log entry to be entered to dismiss the alarm/alert. The &lsquo;auto log&rsquo; type allows the operator to dismiss the alarm/alert and automatically makes a log entry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Each alarm/alert type can be flagged by the facility supervisor to be any combination of the following states: operator-related, disposable-related, instrument-related, instrument-setup-related, procedure-program-related, procedure-run-related, critical, count-for-reports (makes it appear on alarm/alerts by operator and instrument report). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> Single-user devices (PDA devices) may be available for each operator to interactively input data and process alarm/alerts. These devices are operator-specific, not facility-wide. The items that are displayed in this context are: full alarm/alert text for alarm/alerts routed to the current operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Routing alarm/alerts will depend on the hardware to be used. If mobile devices are used, then alarm/alerts will be routed to operators whenever the system knows that the operator is using a certain device. The alarm/alert must not interrupt the current entry screen. All operators may view all alarm/alerts (but only authorized operators may dismiss or log resolutions). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> At login, whenever a password is required, the operator must either scan a set of instruments or press &ldquo;All&rdquo; to associate a certain set of instruments (or all instruments) with the operator. Alarm/alerts are initially routed only to operators associated with the instrument, but after a site-selected timeout period, the alarm/alert routing is widened to go to all operators, and the signaling (beeping or flashing) becomes more pronounced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> As an exception to the above routing requirements, a nomogram check alert will always be routed to the operator who logged the procedure-program instead of the operators associated with the instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Instrument alarm/alerts are predefined by the instrument firmware. The present system will use the same alarm/alerts that the instrument generates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> System-generated alarm/alerts will include the following type. If a bleed is apparently in progress (based on logging of events by the operator) and no procedure log data has come from the instrument in the three seconds prior to the operator&apos;s log, then an alarm/alert must occur to warn the operator that the instrument is not working, or the network is not working or not connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> If an instrument is detected to be in run mode but the instrument is not an authorized device, an alarm/alert will occur to warn the operator that an unauthorized device is in use. An alarm/alert is generated when the instrument is powered up, as a diagnostic tool to verify that it is connected properly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> An alarm/alert is generated if there is a mismatch between an instrument record and its previous record, such as could occur if the same Ethernet MAC address is used on two devices, or if someone swaps the networking connections or devices. This requirement is only necessary if the system design would potentially permit such an error to occur, such that the actual source of the data is unknown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> If the system is rebooted during one or more bleeds, it must figure out which instruments are in a bleed process after it comes back on-line. To associate the running instruments with the data that may have been collected before the crash, it generates a reboot-resync alarm/alert for each instrument that is running. The operators&apos; responses to this alarm/alert re-associate the instrument with the donor and bleed numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> The facility has the option of running as many as ten independent display screens at the same time, and is able to choose which type of display to show on each screen. These are intended for mounting where all floor staff can easily view the screens. All displays support standard monitor sizes and resolutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> One status screen is the overview screen. The overview screen includes highly summarized compacted data items shown for each instrument. Depending on the monitor size and number of instruments, the overview screen may be scrollable, or two or more screens may be needed to display the status for all instruments. The overview screen should match the floor layout of the instruments in groups or areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Another status screen shows the instrument number (e.g. 1, 2, 3, not the serial number), alarm/alert conditions&mdash;just a highlight if there is an active alarm/alert, instrument display text, the amount of plasma collected in this procedure, a bar chart of plasma volume per programmed amount, the operating state of the instrument (out of order, not in use, in use, or on reserve), and an indicator if the instrument is associated with at least one operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Another status screen displays the full alarm/alert text for all active alarm/alerts, with the related instrument Another status screen is a dispatch screen. The dispatch screen is similar to the overview screen. However, the dispatch screen adds an interactive function. The dispatch screen shows these data items in the same layout as the overview screen: instrument internal number (e.g. 1, 2, 3, not the serial number), a bar chart of plasma volume per programmed amount, the operating state of the Apheresis machine (out of order, not in use, in use, or on-reserve) The dispatch screen includes a function which allows an instrument to easily be placed on reserve. &ldquo;On-reserve&rdquo; is a pseudo-state of the instrument that is only relevant within the dispatch screen itself, and is never communicated or stored in any other part of the system. When on reserve, a instrument stays on reserve for 20 minutes or until its actual state changes to a run state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> The system comprises two levels of accuracy checks: (1) dual entry&mdash;the most stringent, and (2) confirmation&mdash;slightly less stringent but quicker. The system requires dual entry of the target collection volume because accuracy of this entry is paramount. One entry is inputted into the instrument as is currently done. The second entry is calculated based on the donor weight, which is passed automatically from the donor management system (DMS). The calculation is based on a mapping of weight-ranges to volumes (nomograms), which will be controlled by a setup function. If the calculated nomogram and programmed value do not match, an alarm/alert is issued. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The system also requires dual entry of the donor number and bleed number. These numbers are originated by the DMS, printed on barcode labels, and also inputted pushed into the system. The system compares barcode scans with the directly passed values and prevents entry of the scanned barcodes if they do not match. The comparison of donor and bleed numbers is done as a unit, not each separately, since there is only one correct donor number for each particular bleed number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> If an event is logged, but it is out of sequence with the previous event on an instrument, then a warning is displayed but the events are logged as usual. Sequencing is determined by a table of A-B pairs where &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo; are two events and &ldquo;B&rdquo; normally follows &ldquo;A&rdquo;. The table may be determined at design. For example, if a venipuncture follows a donor-disconnect event, this signals a warning because the entry (disconnect, venipuncture) is not in the sequence table. An exception is the order of the arm-prep and procedure-program events which may be interchanged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> If an expiration date is scanned in any context, and the date is earlier than the current date, then a warning is displayed and the operator may continue or go back and scan a different item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> If an instrument is scanned, and that instrument number is not an authorized and enabled device, then a warning is presented and the operator may continue or cancel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> If a lot number is scanned, and that lot number has not been entered as a released lot, then a warning is presented and the operator may continue or go back and scan a different item. In order to handle this, the facility management must enter released lot information as defined under data storage requirements&mdash;disposable lots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> If a lot number is scanned and that lot has been entered as a bad lot, then a warning is presented and the operator may continue or go back and scan a different item. In order to handle this, the facility management must enter lot numbers and associated messages in a bad-lot list, with product numbers added by operator, and dates. The list may also be broadcast to all other facilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> If a bleed number is scanned/entered, and that number is already in the database, a warning is presented and the operator may continue or cancel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> Scanning a barcode is an insufficient action to commit permanent data storage of information. Any scanned input must require the operator to use keyboard or touch- screen input to confirm/verify the scanned values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> If an instrument setup is logged, and the instrument has not had a daily weight scale verification logged within the last 24 hours, then a warning is presented and the operator may continue or cancel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> If an instrument setup is logged, and the instrument has not had a field-service-report logged within the last year (or time period specified by customer), then a warning is presented and the operator may continue or cancel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> When an abnormal-disconnect event is logged, the computed value of cell loss volume must be suggested to the user, who may accept or change the suggested value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> In order to assist the operator in making the correct log entries, the operator must be able to view all the log entries that have been made for any bleed that is in progress. For bleeds that have ended, this information is available in reports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> If a calibration weight is entered in the daily maintenance log, and the measured weight is more than some pre-defined percent variance, then a warning is presented and the operator may continue or cancel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> If a venipuncture event is logged and the donor requires a blood sample, a message is given to this effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> When an Hb detect alarm is logged, the operator is notified what number Hb detect this is for the bleed, e.g. first, second, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> When a venipuncture event is logged, the operator must re-scan the bleed number, and if the bleed number does not match the bleed number scanned for the procedure-program event on the same instrument, an error message must be presented, and the operator may not continue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The system database server is secured by password protection (at least), and the passwords are different for each installation and changeable by the administrator at any time. Read and write access to each of several different areas of data are separately controllable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Users are identified by a user ID, password, and scannable badge number. The user must log on using the user ID and password. Passwords are 4 or more characters in length and may not be the same as the login ID. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> Relaxed security is tolerated in the case of a mobile device, under this condition: If the device was used by an operator in the past hour and the same operator logs in again on the same device, no password is required, only the operator&apos;s ID number is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> Relaxed security is also tolerated in connection with a mobile device where an operator logs on using the user ID and password, and scans his badge number, then when he/she logs on again during the same shift (a center-selectable time period), only the badge number is required to validate the operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> Users and passwords are maintained at both the facility level and the headquarters level, separately. Facility-level users will only have login access at that facility. Headquarter-level users will have login access at all facilities. The distinction of the two levels does not grant any privileges to the user. Rather, it only specifies at what site the user records are managed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> Operators are able to choose their own passwords and change them at any time, but not on a mobile device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> To handle forgotten passwords, the system includes a method for an administrator to reset a selected user&apos;s password to a random-4-digit number, then the operator must be forced to change his password on the next login, and within 15 minutes. After 15 minutes the account will be unusable until the password is reset again by the administrator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> To handle occasional password changes, the system includes a means for allowing an administrator to flag all accounts to force a password change on the next login. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> All network devices must be authorized by manually entering their serial numbers or MAC addresses, including wireless devices, such that a new, unrecognized device cannot successfully send or retrieve data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0154" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0154&rsqb;</number> The system may support as many as 100 instruments and up to 20 operator devices. These will generally be in a 6:1 ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The headquarters system must support merging the databases from up to 90 facilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> The system monitors operator performance. At maximum scale when all devices are in operation, the system should never enter into a sustained period of slow performance lasting more than one minute, where slow performance is defined as a 2-second lag between operator input and the next prompt. A lag of up to one second is acceptable under normal operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Because of the possibility that the facility will develop software linking to the system, and that software could place unforeseen demands on the system, such as excessively large or non-optimized database queries, facility extensions must be kept as an exemption to the performance requirements. The facility&apos;s extensions can be run during hours of low-use or non-use of the instruments if this turns out to be a problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> The system must be able to operate continuously for at least 18 hours at fall utilization, out of each 24-hour period. The system may be designed to run internal downtime procedures, in which case the instruments may not operate during that time. The downtime procedures may not last more than 4 hours in any 24 hour period. The customer must have the option to schedule the downtime procedures at a time appropriate for them. Each facility has the option to continue running the system during the remaining hours in order to run software extensions that interface to the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> Technical Facility Requirements </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> Underlying many of the technical requirements is the fact that, typically, there will not be IT staff available at the facilities, and so the system must be relatively self- correcting and require few inputs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> A diagnostic mode is provided to ensure that the mobile devices can communicate full-circuit to the instruments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> The operational state of the system server (i.e. running or down) is detectable by the instruments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> There are a number or reliability requirements. For instance, the mobile devices and instruments reliability do not have an impact on system reliability because they are redundant and replaceable. The number of extra mobile devices needed to account for failures can be determined after installation. However, the reliability of non-redundant commodity equipment, such as the database server, is not considered a formal requirement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> In the event of theft, fire, or irreparable physical damage to the database server, such as disk failure, the system must be able to be rebuilt with new components and loaded with archived data within 12 hours, and the number of hours of data loss in this case may not exceed 4 hours. The high resolution logs are exempt from the data loss requirement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> In the event of unexpected shutdown of the server, or crash, or power loss, the server reboots and continues operations with a maximum data loss of the period one minute prior to the shutdown. When the system is rebooted, it resumes logging data related to bleeds that were started or were continued during the downtime. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> The system is be fail-safe between components, i.e. failures in one component may not cause data loss or the need to reboot the rest of the system. In particular, communication failures to a mobile device are recoverable without user intervention, and power loss of any component including the central server should not require user intervention other than restoring power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> As conceived, the instruments and NetDev devices (where necessary) use UDP/IP network packets. Therefore network packets are verified at the UDP level. As a result, there is some data loss of the high-resolution procedure logs. The allowable losses may be one sample per 60 seconds from each device. Therefore, at least 59 samples per minute are be stored. These 59 samples must be perfect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0168" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0168&rsqb;</number> False-positive network packets may occur where the packet is read incorrectly but the checksum happens to match so it is presumed to be correct. Reliability in this case is generally 99.99%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0169" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0169&rsqb;</number> A set of entry screens is provided to allow the input of bleed-related log information and maintenance log information, to be used after a period of downtime during which paper logging was used. Medium-resolution and high-resolution logs will not be reconstructed in the event of downtime; they will be considered expendable in this situation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0170" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0170&rsqb;</number> Further, the system has the following compatibility requirements. Donor and bleed number barcodes that have been printed by another customer system in code 39 or UCCEAN 128 formats, are readable by the system. Up to 20 alphanumeric characters are supported. If using UCCEAN 128, the facility must enter the barcode field identifiers for bleeds and donors in a setup function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Permanent donor number barcodes are generally 9 characters, e.g. A00001888&mdash;where A00001 is a consecutive number (i.e. all the way thru Z99999) and 888 is a 3 position unique facility number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0172" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0172&rsqb;</number> Bleed number barcodes are generally ten characters, e.g. 00MMIA0001&mdash;where 00 is the last 2 digits of the year, MMI is a unique facility identifier, and A0001 is a consecutive number thru Z99999. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0173" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0173&rsqb;</number> Instrument barcodes that have been printed in UCCEAN 128 format, are be readable by the system. Instrument serial numbers allow up to <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> alphanumeric characters, and use field identifier <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0174" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0174&rsqb;</number> Operator badge barcodes are printed by Baxter in UCCEAN 128 format and are readable by the system. Badge numbers allow up to 15 alphanumeric characters, and use field identifier <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0175" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0175&rsqb;</number> Product-related barcodes are printed by any product manufacturer in UCCEAN 128 format and are readable by the system. Up to four fields may be combined in any combination up to three separate barcodes, or all together in one barcode. Field identifiers are as follows: universal product code (UPN)&mdash;field 01, lot number&mdash;field 10, expiration date&mdash;format YYMMDD&mdash;field 17, and quantity&mdash;field 30. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Still further, the database server should be accessible by widely used methods, so that the facility can access data for interfacing with other existing or new systems. Unless other methods are proven adequate, this implies that the database will use standard SQL accessible through, for example, Microsoft ODBC and/or a database driver that runs under Microsoft Windows. Direct database access is the primary method to allow the system to interface with other systems. Also, the security considerations may limit the manner and level in which a facility can access the database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Instructions are be provided to enable a trained database administrator to export portions of the headquarters database, selected by date range, to a transportable file format, which, for example, may be a Microsoft Access database format. This will be used to export data for review by regulatory agencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> The system provides a method for a donor management system to send a new bleed number, time donor entered floor, donor number, whether or not a blood sample is required, and donor weight. The system does not the use of donor and bleed numbers that have not been sent by the facility system. The facility system initiates this transfer. If the DMS does not pass the donor and bleed numbers, no data will be logged for that bleed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0179" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0179&rsqb;</number> The system also provides a way for a donor management system to obtain summary data items for each bleed. The facility system also initiates this transfer by requesting the summary for a given bleed number. The items are: bleed finished&mdash;yes/no (if no, then the summary data should not be considered accurate), arm used, donor reaction&mdash;yes or no, plasma volume collected, instrument number, over- or under-draw, and reason if so, cell loss volume, and donor number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0180" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0180&rsqb;</number> The system server includes a mechanism for sending messages to a particular instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0181" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0181&rsqb;</number> The system also includes requirements for data transfer between the facility database and the HQ database. The facility database must be designed with a location identifier in each applicable record so that multiple system databases can be merged without key violations (e.g. an ABRA 4-digit code). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0182" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0182&rsqb;</number> All management software functions and reports are available from the application server at the facility, and also from the application server at the facility database. When running off of the HQ database, each function and report must request user input to determine which location or region to affect. When running at the facility, the functions do not request such input. It is not necessary for the operator logging functions, alarm/alert functions, or any other real-time functions to run against the facility database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0183" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0183&rsqb;</number> The system server is be backed up to the HQ server at intervals assigned by the facility, and only the changed records will be transferred. The backup includes the resolution logs (bleed-related data), the instrument-related data, maintenance-event data, and disposable lot data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0184" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0184&rsqb;</number> The facility databases are polled every 15 minutes by HQ (or another user defined interval) and any changed records will be copied to HQ. Facility databases are, therefore, only temporary stores, and do not need any other backup scheme. The HQ database may be backed up with a tape backup system or any other suitable means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0185" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0185&rsqb;</number> The provider has access to the high resolution procedure logs, ad-hoc one at a time. This is accomplished by sending the logs automatically from the system server to the HQ server, and allowing the provider access to the area of the HQ server where logs are stored. The high-resolution logs may be copied during each night from the facilities to HQ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0186" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0186&rsqb;</number> Software upgrades are handled by action at the HQ level only, and must not be designed to normally require center-level user interaction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0187" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0187&rsqb;</number> The system and HQ servers typically run on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 or later. The database servers typically run on Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 or later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0188" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0188&rsqb;</number> Data Interfacing </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0189" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0189&rsqb;</number> The present system relies upon data interfacing from three primary sources: the workstation(s), the wireless PDAs, and the facility instruments. The interfacing is accomplished via web browser technology. Therefore, the data interfacing comprises several web pages for data input and verification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0190" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0190&rsqb;</number> System Workstation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0191" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0191&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the screens for operating and monitoring the system from a web-based workstation are illustrated. These screens are navigated very simply. Since every screen includes a menu of options, the user may access any particular screen by simply clicking on a menu item. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0192" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0192&rsqb;</number> From any screen, any one of the following options may be selected: search (search by various criteria for bleed numbers), location (HQ only: change the location or region to supply data to the current and subsequent reports), setup (leads to a number of setup screens), monitor (shows live machine monitor), dispatch (shows machine dispatch status), help (a help system), and logout (ends session, there is also a timeout which can be defined in setup). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0193" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0193&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the login screen <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is where the user logs into the system. Once the user has accessed the server through their browser, they will be asked to log into the system. If they are at a facility ISP, they will have access to facility data only. If they are at headquarters, they can see data for all facilities. On this screen, the user enters his/her user ID and password, and the system verifies the ID and password. If the ID and password match the records in the system database, the user is logged into the system until they timeout (defined in setup) or logout of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0194" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0194&rsqb;</number> The user enters the user ID and presses tab to move the cursor to next field. The user enters the password and clicks OK, then return. The system checks entries against the database. If there is a match, the system goes to a welcome screen <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). If the user&apos;s credentials are incorrect, the system shows a message, e.g. &ldquo;Your ID or password is incorrect. Please try again.&rdquo; On the fourth try, the system shows another message, e.g. &ldquo;Your ID or password is incorrect. See your system administrator for help.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0195" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0195&rsqb;</number> The welcome screen <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, illustrated on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, comes up when a user logs into the system. If the user has logged into headquarters, they can choose to see all data, data for a particular center, or data for a particular region by selecting the location data from a pick list at the top of the screen. The pick list will drop down from the top with all data in one column, then all setup groups (from the setup screen, i.e. region 1, region 2, region 3, custom 1, by center), the &ldquo;Center&rdquo; option brings up a list on the right with all centers as options. Default will be all data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0196" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0196&rsqb;</number> If a user has logged into a facility, the facility title will appear as a second heading and no location pick list will appear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0197" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0197&rsqb;</number> From the welcome screen <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, the user can click any of the section tabs, &ldquo;Search,&rdquo; &ldquo;Administration,&rdquo; &ldquo;Reports,&rdquo; &ldquo;Monitor,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dispatch,&rdquo; &ldquo;Help,&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Logout,&rdquo; to go to any section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0198" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0198&rsqb;</number> Administration </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0199" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0199&rsqb;</number> First, referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a setup and an administration operation. The setup and administration operations are accessed by clicking on the &ldquo;Administration&rdquo; tab at the top of any screen. When the &ldquo;Administration&rdquo; tab is clicked, an administration menu <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> appears (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). From the administration menu <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, information regarding facility operators, instruments, data, and the overall system can be input or edited. The information entered during setup is used during operation of the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to verify operations, monitor procedures, monitor inventory, create reports, schedule maintenance, and the like. The administration menu <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes links to screens or pages where the information is inputted or edited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0200" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0200&rsqb;</number> The administration menu <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a link to a change password screen <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the change password screen allows the user to change his/her password by simply typing their current password, their new password, and repeating their new password for verification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0201" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0201&rsqb;</number> The administration menu <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also includes a link to a reset passwords screen <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>.

<paragraph id="P-0300" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0300&rsqb;</number> When the user scans an instrument, if the instrument has a bleed in progress, the device displays the screen of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 83</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>; otherwise, the device shows an error message. If the user clicks on a summary entry (e.g. machine setup), the device scrolls down to the corresponding detail entry. If the user clicks &ldquo;Done,&rdquo; the device goes to the main menu. If the user clicks &ldquo;Cancel,&rdquo; (also denoted in the Figures as an &ldquo;X&rdquo;) the device goes to the main menu. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0301" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0301&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is an illustration of the check machine assignments screen. This screen is used to check which instruments are assigned to a particular operator. Thus, this screen allows the operator to view a list of the instruments. The machine list field displays all of the instrument numbers (both low number and serial numbers) associated with the operator. If the user clicks &ldquo;Change,&rdquo; the device goes to the assign machines screen (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 81</cross-reference>). If the user clicks &ldquo;Done,&rdquo; the device goes to the main menu. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0302" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0302&rsqb;</number> The get text screen (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 85</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) helps troubleshoot network or setup problems by testing the communication path from the scanner to the instrument. The user scans an instrument, which causes the instrument&apos;s display to show up on the PDA as shown on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 85</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. When the clicks &ldquo;Done&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cancel,&rdquo; the device goes to the main menu. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0303" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0303&rsqb;</number> The remaining screens are event logging screens. The event logging screens are used to log operator actions on the system, e.g. a machine setup, a venipuncture, and so on. All screens contain a top banner displaying the event type. The main part of the screen varies depending on the event type. Many of the events require a series of screens to enter all of the information to log. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0304" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0304&rsqb;</number> If the screen is in a series (except the first), it includes a &ldquo;Previous&rdquo; (or back arrow) button and a &ldquo;Next&rdquo; (or forward arrow) button, which goes to the previous screen or next screen in the series. If the screen is a single-screen entry or is the last in the series, it includes a &ldquo;Verify/Scan badge&rdquo; entry field, which, when filled with the correct user ID for the current user, logs/verifies the event. The &ldquo;Cancel&rdquo; (or &ldquo;X&rdquo;) button takes the user back to the main menu without logging anything. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0305" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0305&rsqb;</number> Log entries require scanning the operator badge to commit/verify. For each attempted log entry, the system matches the scanned badge ID with the ID that was used when the operator logged in initially. If there is a match, the log entry is committed, and the subsequent action is taken (usually to return to the main menu). If it does not match, an error is presented, such as &ldquo;You did not scan the correct operator badge,&rdquo; and the user returns to the main menu without logging anything. This prevents accidental swapping of devices between operators. If this occurs, the operator will have to start over with the log entry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0306" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0306&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are related to the Standard Procedure group. First, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 87</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>represent the machine setup screen. The machine setup screen is used for the original instrument setup as well as for replacement products. When called as a subroutine in the latter case, the title is &ldquo;Replacement Product.&rdquo; The machine setup screen is where the user enters the data necessary for a machine setup log entry. Up to 10 product components can be entered, and the screen of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is presented multiple times as necessary. The scan machine field comprises the scanned instrument ID. The unlabeled scan fields comprise one to three barcode scans including the product code, lot number, and expiration date. These are shown as scanned on screen and unpacked into the components when saved and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. When the user scans a machine, the device displays the screen of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. When the user clicks &ldquo;NEXT&rdquo; or &ldquo;More Products,&rdquo; the device repeats the screen of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for another component. When the user clicks &ldquo;Done,&rdquo; the device shows the screen of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. When the user clicks &ldquo;Re-scan,&rdquo; the device deletes the component and returns to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to allow the operator to re-scan the component. The operator may simply press &ldquo;DONE&rdquo; again to remove the component without replacing it with a new one. When the user scans the correct operator ID, the device commits the log entry and goes to the main menu. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0307" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0307&rsqb;</number> The procedure program screen is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 88</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. The procedure program screen is where the user enters the data necessary for a procedure-program log entry. If after the screen of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 88</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, the system detects that the bleed and donor do not match a bleed/donor pair passed from the facility&apos;s system, a warning is presented, and the user may not continue. The plasma volume programmed must match the value passed from the facility system, but this check is done in the background, not as part of the sequence of these screens. If there is a mismatch, a new alarm/alert is generated to this effect. The scan machine, scan bleed, and scan donor contain the scanned IDs for the instrument, bleed number, and donor, respectively. If the user scans the instrument, the device goes to the page of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 88</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. If user scans the bleed number, the device goes to the page of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 88</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. If the user scans the donor number, the device goes to the page of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>. If the user clicks &ldquo;Log Arm Prep,&rdquo; the device goes to page 2 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of the arm prep log screen (assume the same machine). If the user clicks &ldquo;Log Venipuncture,&rdquo; the device goes to page 2 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of the venipuncture log screen (assume the same machine).

<paragraph id="P-0310" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0310&rsqb;</number> The user enters the data necessary for a venipuncture log entry on the venipuncture screen (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 90</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). If after page 3 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>), the system detects that a blood sample is required (based on inputs from the facility system), the device presents page 4 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). Else, the device skips page 4. The scan machine and the scan bleed fields comprise the instrument ID and the bleed number, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0311" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0311&rsqb;</number> If the user scans instrument, the device goes to page 2 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). If the user scans the bleed number, the device checks that the bleed number is correct (the same bleed that was scanned for the procedure-program log entry on the same machine) and displays an error message if not. If OK, the device goes to page 3 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). If the user scans the correct operator ID, the device logs the entries. If a blood sample is needed, the device goes to page 4 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). Else, the device goes to the main menu. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0312" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0312&rsqb;</number> The user enters data necessary for a remove plasma log entry on the remove plasma screen (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 91</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>). If this screen is accessed from the main menu, page 1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is shown first. If the screen is accessed from the alert screen, page 2 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is shown first (since the machine is already known based on the alert). Page 3 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) is only shown if the system detects an over or under-draw (UON or UUN). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0313" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0313&rsqb;</number> The calculated nomogram is displayed in the calculated nomogram field. This is the value passed from the facility system. The actual collection field is an entry field. The default value displayed in the field is the value calculated by the instrument. The user can override this. The reason for over/under-draw field is a pick list field which contains user defined reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0314" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0314&rsqb;</number> If the user scans the instrument, the device checks whether there is a remove plasma alert active for that instrument. If there is no active alert, the device goes to page 2 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). If there is an active alert, the device gives an error message. If the user clicks &ldquo;OK&rdquo; (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) the device calculates whether the default or corrected actual volume constitutes a UUN/UON. If so, the device goes to page 4 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>). Else, the device goes to page 5 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>). If the user clicks a reason from page 4 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>), the device goes to page 5 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 91</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>). If the user scans the correct operator ID, the device logs the entries and goes to the main menu. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0315" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0315&rsqb;</number> The user enters data necessary for a disconnect donor log entry on the disconnect donor screen (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 92</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>).

Because the scenarios that occur when products are discarded are especially complex, they are broken out into sub-menus and several subroutines. The required data items that must be stored with each of the three kinds of log entries used within the change-kit scenarios are product performance (records when any product is discarded for any reason), second venipuncture (records when a second stick is made for any reason), and machine setup (records when a new product is used for any reason). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0331" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0331&rsqb;</number> If the user selects the &ldquo;Change Disposable Component&rdquo; button under Exceptions from the main menu, the change disposable screen is activated. When the user clicks the &ldquo;Change Disposable Component&rdquo; button, page 1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is displayed. Upon selecting any of the three logging options on page 1, page 2 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is displayed. Depending on the logging option selected on page 1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), the specific screens that the device displays will vary depending on the reason for the change and when the change occurred (from page 2), the reason for the discard, performance issue, second venipuncture, or other. If the disposable is discard for a performance issue, there are three types of information to log: the reason for the change; information about the component being discarded; and information about the replacement component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0332" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0332&rsqb;</number> If the disposable is changed for a performance issue prior to the bleed procedure, the following procedure is followed. The user selects &ldquo;Performance Issue&rdquo; on page 1 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), and page 2 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is displayed. The user selects &ldquo;Before Use&rdquo; on page 2, and page 3 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) is displayed. The user scans the instrument&apos;s barcode, and page 4 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>) is displayed. A discarded product category is selected from a pick list on page 4, and page 5 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>) is displayed. Once the user has selected a discarded product code from the list provided on page 5, page 6 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>) is displayed. On page 6, the user either selects the lot number of the discarded product or enters the lot number manually. After the lot number is entered, page 7 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</cross-reference><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>) is displayed. On page 7, the user selects the problem that occurred with the disposable product, and page 8 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</cross-reference><highlight><italic>h</italic></highlight>) is displayed. On page 8, the user selects the component that the problem occurred with from the list provided. If the problem occurred with a separation device, then page 10 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</cross-reference><highlight><italic>j</italic></highlight>) is displayed. Otherwise, page 9 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</cross-reference><highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>) is displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0333" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0333&rsqb;</number> On page 10, the user enters the videojet number in the spaced provided and selects &ldquo;OK.&rdquo; Page 9 (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 99</cross-reference><highlight><italic>i</italic></highlight>) is then displayed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0354" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0354&rsqb;</number> Instrument Data </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0355" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0355&rsqb;</number> The system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also allows a facility to gather data from the laboratory instruments. This data can be monitored in real time, or near real time, from remote locations, the workstation(s), or the PDAs. The present system has the ability to convert parallel data to Ethernet which allows the data to be seen using a common web browser. This enables present system to be integrated into existing blood collection facilities that utilize legacy apheresis instruments having a proprietary pin arrangement, such as the Autopheresis-C plasmapheresis instrument supplied by the Fenwal Division of Baxter International. The data conversion is accomplished by the serial/parallel to Ethernet converters or NetDev&trade; devices <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0356" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0356&rsqb;</number> Typically, an Autopheresis-C apheresis instrument transmits parallel data at fixed intervals. Each data sample consists of a binary stream. The data transmission limitations of an Autopheresis-C communication are overcome by the serial/parallel to Ethernet converters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>.

From a network point of view, the converters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are nodes, although the source of data comes from the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0357" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0357&rsqb;</number> An Autopheresis-C is typically designed to operate in transmit mode only, although a hardwired signal line between each Autopheresis-C and each converter can be used to communicate network data to the Autopheresis-C. Such data may originate from the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the form of acknowledgment data, which then passes through the converter to the Autopheresis-C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0358" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0358&rsqb;</number> There are several types of data packets transmitted from the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The formats for all of the packets contain header information about the actual length of data that they encapsulate. A first type of packet contains diagnostic information, including crash reports, stack and ram dump. The data are sent once in continuous blocks at power-up of the apheresis instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0359" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0359&rsqb;</number> A second type of packet contains run information and is sent is sent approximately 10 times per second (unless replaced by a configuration packet, as described below) after power up and initial start up (lasting approximately 5 seconds) of the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. This occurs throughout the power-on state of the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, whether it is in a bleed or not. A modecode field of the packet of the second type is examined to determine the state of the machine. Each run packet includes a first echo field that the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>expect the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to echo back in a data packet within 10 seconds after it was transmitted by an instrument <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0360" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0360&rsqb;</number> A third type of packet contains configuration data. This packet is sent in place of a run packet at predetermined intervals. At each of the intervals, the configuration packet is sent 5 times, once per second (over a 5 second total) every <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> minutes, and at specific states of the machine, such as power-up, before the venipuncture is expected, and at the end of a bleed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0361" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0361&rsqb;</number> Additional data packets, called network management packets, are transmitted on different ports than the diagnostic, run, and configuration packets. A first network management packet is transmitted from the converters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>to the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. This packet is generated by a converter and received by the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and is the first packet to be sent after a converter reboot (after bootp reply). Thereafter it is repeated every 8 seconds (with redundant duplicates). This packet provides information about communication status. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0362" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0362&rsqb;</number> A second network management packet, or reset packet, is transmitted from the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to each converter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. This packet is sent as a broadcast out of a port on the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> when the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> boots, or can be sent to an individual device. The reset packet causes the converter to reboot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0363" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0363&rsqb;</number> A third network management packet, or parameter packet, is sent by the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> primarily to signal to an instrument <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>that the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has received the run packets. The system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is expected to the parameter packet every 3 seconds. The parameter packet contains the first echo field response to the run packet. Each parameter packet further includes a second echo field that the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>echo in the run packet, and a third echo that the converters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>echo in the information packet. The system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can use these echo fields to determine of the last parameter packet transmitted by the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> was received by either the converters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>or the instruments <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0364" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0364&rsqb;</number> In a typical scenario, an apheresis instrument is booting when the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is already running. First, the converter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> boots. At reset, an indicator lamp flashes. The converter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> sends bootp requests until it gets a broadcast reply from the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> assigning it an IP address. Once the converter has an IP address, it will send an information packet to gather apheresis instrument data and transmit the data to the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The converter will timeout and reboot when it detects no apheresis instrument activity after 3 seconds, or no system server 34 activity after 8 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0365" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0365&rsqb;</number> The converter boot is relatively quick. Once the converter boot is completed, the converter waits for the apheresis instrument to boot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0366" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0366&rsqb;</number> Once the converter boot (bootp) is completed and after the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has received the information packet from the converter, the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> sends a parameter packet to the converter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0367" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0367&rsqb;</number> On power up, the apheresis instrument sends a diagnostic packet to the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. If the diagnostic packet includes a non-functional report, the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> disables the apheresis instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0368" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0368&rsqb;</number> Next, the apheresis instrument sends a configuration packet to the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Thus, the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> receives an information packet, a diagnostic packet, and a configuration packet shortly after the apheresis instrument boots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0369" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0369&rsqb;</number> Generally during a bleed procedure, a first indicator lamp or LED flashes as the converter sends Ethernet packets to the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. A second indicator lamp or LED signals when data collisions occur. An apheresis instrument sends a run or configuration packet at predetermined intervals. The majority of the data traffic on the first network <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made up of run packets. Configuration packets are interleaved at specific intervals as described above. The system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> sends a parameter packet at predetermined intervals (asynchronously with run packets), and the converter sends an information packet at predetermined intervals (asynchronously with the run packets). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0370" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0370&rsqb;</number> The converters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>reset on several conditions. In every case, an indicator lamp or LED will signal when a reset occurs. The converters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>reset when no apheresis instrument packets are received for 3 seconds. The converters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>also reset when the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> sends a reset packet, when an internal software fault causes a hardware reset, and when no system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> packets are seen for 8 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0371" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0371&rsqb;</number> During a system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> outage, the converters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>will continuously reset until the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> application starts up again. When the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> application broadcasts a reset packet, all of the converters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>reset, and the boot procedure continues as if the system server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> was booted first, and all the converters <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>were booted later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0372" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0372&rsqb;</number> Practical Example </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0373" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0373&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 95, a</cross-reference> method of using the apparatus of the present invention for automating the workflow within a blood collection facility is illustrated in flowchart format. This method includes monitoring the apheresis processes for the occurrence of specific events, and routing data regarding these events to PDAs or personal mobile devices for operator-assisted logging. The data provides a snapshot of the operational status of the apheresis instrument and is stored along with the logged event. Additional events can be logged directly on the PDAs through menu selections. The system also provides a means for performing verification of input data logged with each event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0374" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0374&rsqb;</number> The data snapshots can be displayed on a web browser in real time or near real time. The system also provides HTML-based query and reporting of aggregate data from the logged events and snapshots. Open standard protocol is provided for transferring the aggregate data from/to other blood facilities&apos; computer systems. The aggregate data can be used to drive business decisions in operator training, inventory management, donor recruitment, and machine maintenance and servicing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0375" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0375&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention begins with a donor walking into the donation site. The donor produces his ID card. The receptionist scans the donor ID card. An RF handheld terminal/web client, a PDA, with a built in bar code scanner is used to prompt the screener to scan the donor ID card bar code. The system server verifies the donor ID by searching a database and displays an eligibility outcome. The database search is made automatically when the donor ID card is read. The donor ID input causes a uniform resource locator (URL) to run and connects the web client to a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) server via a wireless link. The system server runs an application to search against a national donor eligibility database or, alternatively, the central server&apos;s DMS. The result is returned to the client application. The result of the search is returned instantaneously. If the donor is not eligible, the computer displays the eligibility date for this donor, and the donor is deferred. Otherwise, the site receptionist prepares to take the vital signs and medical history of the donor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0376" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0376&rsqb;</number> Next, the vital signs and medical history of the donor are transmitted to a donor screening database. The donor vital signs are input and stored in a donor screening database. This is accomplished by entering the vital sign data in an HTML form located on the handheld terminal. The form is then submitted to the system server via the mobile module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0377" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0377&rsqb;</number> Similarly, responses to a donor medical history checklist are entered electronically. The medical history data are entered on an HTML form on the handheld terminal. The form is then submitted to the system server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0378" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0378&rsqb;</number> Donor eligibility is automatically derived based on the input donor ID, the input donor vital sign data, and the donor&apos;s medical history data. A set criteria for eligibility is predetermined and configurable within the database on the system server. The system server runs an application to verify against the set of criteria and returns the outcome to the client. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0379" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0379&rsqb;</number> If the donor&apos;s vital signs are acceptable and the donor is eligible, an identifier such as a bleed number is generated and queued in a scheduling database. The scheduling database now points to or has access to donor demographics, vital signs, and medical history, and the donor&apos;s weight is used by the system server to calculate a nomogram; i.e. the volume of blood or blood component to collect. However, if the vital signs are unacceptable, the donor is again deferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0380" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0380&rsqb;</number> The bleed number and the donor ID may be identical. However, the bleed number is preferably a unique identifier that is generated once for each separate donation. A unique bleed number allows the system to differentiate between different bleed or collection procedures performed at different times on the same donor. This is important for traceability and donor evaluations, for example, tracking when the donor last underwent a bleed or collection procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0381" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0381&rsqb;</number> If the donor is accepted, the system server runs an application generated for a qualified donor and returns the approval to the client. The bleed number is printed on a bar code label using a portable printer attached to the handheld terminal. The bleed number is linked to the DMS. The system server creates a donation data file indexed on the bleed number. The donation data comprises the bleed number, the donor&apos;s vital signs, and the donor ID. The bleed number is queued and maintained electronically for daily scheduling. The system server maintains a FIFO list of active bleed numbers for the daily schedule. A count of the number of pending donations is also maintained. Bleed number ranges can be allotted at regular intervals before given out, and can be tracked based on lots, among other tracking methods described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0382" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0382&rsqb;</number> All PDA/scanners and apheresis instruments have network access to the database server(s), including the daily scheduling data. Accordingly, each instrument is a net appliance with an IP address. The instruments communicate over wire links and wireless links with a bridge sitting on a wired network. Each PDA/scanner and monitoring personal computer, thus, functions as a web client. In a preferred embodiment, the instruments are set up to send out data, including events and other data taken during the collection process, at regular time intervals to the facility server, which in-turn can send such information to the main system server, and related databases. Another contemplated embodiment includes using a server directly on the instrument. One PDA/scanner function includes being able to mimic the actual screen display at any point in real time, of each networked instruments, when the PDA/scanner is set to view such information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0383" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0383&rsqb;</number> If an apheresis instrument is available, and the bleed number queue is not empty, a phlebotomist transmits a request from the apheresis instrument to the database. The first available bleed number from the queue is then removed from the queue and allocated to the available apheresis instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0384" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0384&rsqb;</number> An LED display at the apheresis center&apos;s reception area blinks the current bleed number and the apheresis instrument that is available. This instructs the waiting donors to proceed to the available instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0385" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0385&rsqb;</number> Therefore, each apheresis instrument includes a method for the phlebotomist to send a request for a donor to the scheduling database. The phlebotomist pushes a request button which causes a URL to run and connect to the system server. In response to the request for a donor, the scheduling database returns a bleed number to the apheresis instrument. This is accomplished as an application runs on the server to retrieve the next available bleed number. The relevant donor information is retrieved and returned to the apheresis instrument or PDA by another application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0386" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0386&rsqb;</number> In addition, the apheresis instrument or a PDA has a method to notify the scheduling application the apheresis instrument&apos;s readiness to accept a donor. Here, the phlebotomist pushes a button which causes a URL to run and connect to the system server. In response to the apheresis instrument ready notification, the instrument identity and bleed number is broadcast on a public display system. Here, an application is run on the system server to output the instrument identity and the bleed number to the public display system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0387" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0387&rsqb;</number> Future apheresis instruments may be capable of configuring themselves based on the donor information received. The instrument would read the donor information received from the system server and load a system configuration file. Here, the bleed number is inputted into the ready apheresis instrument for verification, instead of the PDA/scanner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0388" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0388&rsqb;</number> Before each action is taken by each operator (such as a phlebotomist) at each instrument, the operator scans (can be a requirement) their own ID card/badge, and the system tracks all actions performed by that operator, and at each instrument, are associated with the operator ID code. The operator typically must scan the machine code first, or vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0389" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0389&rsqb;</number> Next, at the apheresis instrument or PDA/scanner, the bleed number is scanned by the phlebotomist. This bleed number must match the information retrieved by the PDA or the instrument from the system server. The bleed number is read into the apheresis instrument or PDA/scanner and compared with the donor information previously downloaded from the server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0390" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0390&rsqb;</number> The phlebotomist via the PDA or the apheresis instrument notifies the scheduling database when a donor has been accepted at the apheresis instrument. A bleed number match causes a URL to run and connect to the system server. The system server then updates the waiting list of donors by removing the donor from the list by running an application to remove the bleed number from the queue. Thus, the daily donor schedule is updated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0391" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0391&rsqb;</number> Some of the donor acceptance criteria are input from a separate customer system and others are set up as a general rule for the facility. For example, the facility system communicates information to the central server such as the donor ID that has just been registered, the unique bleed number, and the donor&apos;s weight. When the donor arrives at the bedside, his barcoded ID and bleed number are scanned by the PDA/scanner to match what the server is expecting. The donor&apos;s weight is used by the operator to calculate a nomogram. When the operator enters the nomogram, the input is electronically transmitted to the system server which compares the nomogram to the system server&apos;s calculation. If a match is not found, the system server warns the operator of the error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0392" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0392&rsqb;</number> The phlebotomist then scans a blood collection kit&apos;s (i.e. a disposable kits/solutions/transfer pack) identification code, usually a bar code, and enters the relevant information to begin the apheresis procedure. All input and output data associated with the apheresis procedure are stored in the database. These include the access site, the collection volumes, solution volumes, start and end times, donor reactions, and blood/plasma losses. A bar code scanner is, thus, either attached directly to the apheresis instrument or the PDA is used to collect and transmit the information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0393" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0393&rsqb;</number> The apparatus and method of the invention also provides a precheck of all of the disposable kits/solutions/transfer packs used in the blood collection for acceptability before a bleed (procedure) can begin. The system server also verifies that the disposable kits are the right type and within expiration date, the operator is authorized to perform the procedure, and the apheresis instrument is approved. This accomplished by comparing this data with the data configured in the system server for the facility. The lot information may also be verified against a valid lot list on the system server, if one is maintained. This way the apheresis instrument can reject a lot if it has been recalled. If the disposable kit fails the precheck, a warning is transmitted by the system server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0394" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0394&rsqb;</number> The apparatus also tracks usage and inventory of disposable kits/solutions/transfer packs. Inventory of the disposable kits/solutions/transfer packs is tracked via an inventory application. The instrument immediately notifies an inventory application of the disposable kits/solutions/transfer packs&apos; usage. The bar code input cause URLs to run and connect to the system server. The inventory application updates the supply level based on usage. The system server runs an application to update a supplies inventory database. The system server invokes an additional connection to an external server at a supplier&apos;s facility. The supplier&apos;s server in turn updates its orders database. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0395" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0395&rsqb;</number> As described above, the operator logs his/her identity into the system server through the PDA/scanner. The system also includes a database of the phlebotomists&apos; qualifications. For example, certain operators are only qualified to perform certain procedures. When an operator attempts to log in his/her identity and perform a planned blood collection related procedure for which he/she is not unqualified to perform, the system server will produce a warning, or alternatively, prevent the procedure from continuing altogether. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0396" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0396&rsqb;</number> The apparatus provides an automatic trace from the bleed number to all inputs and outputs that are involved in the collection of blood or blood components <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Thus, the bleed number can be traced to the donor, the disposable kits, the facility operator, and the apheresis instrument. This has not been possible, or was a very laborious task. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0397" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0397&rsqb;</number> For the traceability to be accurate, all information must be linked or synched with the apheresis instrument and the bleed number. Therefore, each apheresis instrument has a unique serial number programmed into its memory. Each instrument also has a bar code label associated with it which may or may not be the same as its serial number, and a media access control (MAC) address programmed into the NetDev connected to the apheresis instrument. As phlebotomist goes through the administrative set up function which sets up the apheresis instrument. The serial number, bar code and MAC address are entered into a table within the system server to identify the apheresis instrument. When the apheresis instrument is powered up, it sends the bootp request to the system server, which in turn returns an IP address to the instrument. From then on, the data packets from the instrument are identified by the system server through apheresis instrument&apos;s IP address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0398" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0398&rsqb;</number> This is all transparent to the phlebotomist. From the phlebotomist&apos;s point of view, he/she scans the bar code on the apheresis instrument to set up the apheresis instrument and prepares for a bleed procedure. The system server looks up the serial number of the apheresis instrument from the bar code, and creates a bleed record with the donor bleed number, donor ID, the instrument serial number, and the identity of the disposable kit(s) used. Every time a data packet is received from the apheresis instrument, the system server also looks up the apheresis instrument&apos;s serial number (IP to MAC to serial number) and inserts any relevant information into the corresponding bleed record. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0399" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0399&rsqb;</number> The system also routes apheresis instrument information to the PDAs based on the apheresis instrument that is assigned to or associated with an individual PDA. This is used like a paging system. This enables the phlebotomists to log predefined events (such as instrument alarms) with only a few key strokes. The system is flexible enough to log events from different vendor&apos;s instruments. The specific target routing is performed when the phlebotomist scan the apheresis instrument bar codes at the beginning of a procedure. Since each data packet is traceable to the ID of the originating apheresis instrument, and each PDA has its own network ID, the system server can identify which PDA to route the information to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0400" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0400&rsqb;</number> The pre-processing (pre-venipuncture) configuration of the apheresis instrument is recorded electronically. The information is stored locally on the instrument and transmitted to the system server at the end of the collections. Alternatively, just prior to venipuncture, the instrument configuration is submitted as an HTML form to the system server. The system server then runs an application to write the information into a configuration database file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0401" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0401&rsqb;</number> The statistics and summaries at the end of the collection are also stored electronically. The information is submitted as an HTML form to the system server. The system server then runs an application to write the information into a donation database file. The system server also maintains a count of the total number of blood product units collected for the day. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0402" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0402&rsqb;</number> The system may provide statistics of a procedure execution that is linked to a phlebotomist or phlebotomists, e.g., the events the operator handled, the operator&apos;s error rate (whether they resulted in instrument alarms or not), how many procedures the operator has performed, etc. This provides a means for focused training of individual operators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0403" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0403&rsqb;</number> The system also captures the history of keystrokes performed on the instrument. This can be used later for troubleshooting of instruments or procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0404" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0404&rsqb;</number> Procedural exceptions (alarms and/or adjustments) during collection are recorded electronically. The information is stored locally on the apheresis instrument and transmitted at the end of the collection. Alternatively, whenever an exception is performed, the information is submitted as an HTML form to the system server. The server then runs an application to write the information into a procedure exception database file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0405" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0405&rsqb;</number> The apparatus also logs the apheresis instrument&apos;s cumulative operating hours, calibration, and any service maintenance performed, as well as any malfunctions and/or error occurrences. Each instrument records its cumulative operating hours, calibration and other service maintenance performed, as well as malfunction and error occurrences in its internal memory. On a weekly base or otherwise, an application runs to collect these records from the instruments. This is done by running a URL which connects to the instrument. The instrument in turn runs an application to return the records. Based on the returned records, the application makes a recommendation on service call on each instrument. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0406" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0406&rsqb;</number> The apparatus records blood/plasma loss during a collection. Automatic reports are generated to the appropriate establishments when the loss is greater than acceptable limits. The instrument monitors and calculates blood/plasma loss during a collection. The information is transmitted as part of the summary record at the end of a collection. When an unacceptable blood/plasma loss record is received, the system server connects to the central server and submits a donor deferment report. Other reports pertaining to any of the inputs or outputs may also be requested and generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0407" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0407&rsqb;</number> Next, each apheresis instrument&apos;s operation can be monitored at a central workstation, generally a web client or the system server, or through the PDA/scanner. The operator configures a list of parameters for real time display. If necessary a message or instruction can be transmitted by the operator to a specific instrument for display. The workstation can also check the total units of blood components collected for the day, as well as the number of donors on the waiting list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0408" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0408&rsqb;</number> The workstation monitors parameters associated with the collection process on each apheresis instrument. Accordingly, the monitoring workstation communicates to all of the PDA/scanners and apheresis instruments within the apparatus via a wired or wireless network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0409" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0409&rsqb;</number> The apparatus routes instrument information to the PDAs based on the apheresis instruments that are assigned to the individual PDAs. This allows operators to view and log predefined events (such as instrument alarms) with only a few key strokes. The specific target routing by the system server is done is accomplished when the operator scans the apheresis instrument barcodes at the beginning of a procedure. Since each data packet for the apheresis instrument is traceable to the identity of the apheresis instrument, and each PDA has its own network identity, the system server can route the information to the proper PDA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0410" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0410&rsqb;</number> The workstation application sets up a list of parameters to monitor based on user preference. The application runs a URL/web query to the system server running on the instrument. The instrument runs an application to read the requested parameters and returns them to the application. A java applet runs at the workstation to provide continuous trending of the data received. Alternatively, a stream server is implemented on the instrument and data are continuously streamed to the application and updated in real time. ASP&apos;s are implemented on the instrument. An ASP is a specification for a dynamically created web page that utilizes ActiveX scripting. Dynamic hypertext markup language (DHTML) is run on the workstation to display data dynamically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0411" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0411&rsqb;</number> The workstation also communicates messages to the apheresis instrument. The workstation application submits an HTML form containing messages to the instrument. An application runs on the instrument to display a pop up message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0412" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0412&rsqb;</number> The workstation also has a function to display the cumulative blood product units collected, as well as the total number of donors in the waiting list. The workstation application displays live real time statistics through a java applet, streaming, or DHTML. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0413" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0413&rsqb;</number> Blood and blood component inventory can be tracked by the system. When the apheresis collection is completed, a bar code label identifying the product and volume is printed and affixed to the product. The blood product then moves to a post-processing area such as pathogen inactivation. A different bar code label can be printed and affixed to identify it as having been post-processed. The blood product then moves into the freezer storage area, where each incoming unit is scanned and the corresponding product inventory database is updated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0414" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0414&rsqb;</number> The instrument prints a bar code label containing necessary information identifying the product. The instrument includes a function to print bar code labels on an attached printer. The apheresis instrument prints a bar code label identifying the product as being processed. Accordingly, the apheresis instrument also includes a function to print bar code labels on an attached printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0415" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0415&rsqb;</number> Incoming blood products are identified electronically prior to entering the freezer. A bar code scanner is provided to scan incoming blood products. The blood product inventory is updated for each unit stored in the freezer. Each bar code read from a product unit triggers a URL with the bar code information sent to the system server. The system server then runs an application to update the product inventory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0416" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0416&rsqb;</number> Next, the blood product stays in the freezer area until lab test results of the blood or blood component collected are received. At the shipping area, each blood product unit is scanned and compared with the lab test database and other release requirements. All approved product units are then packaged into a shipping box designated for a certain destination. The center inventory database is updated with the outgoing units, while the end user gets informed of the shipment immediately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0417" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0417&rsqb;</number> A sample test report is used to electronically identify blood product units for release. The sample test report is downloaded to an application on a daily basis. The bleed number on each blood product unit is scanned and verified with that of the approved test sample list. A unit can be released if a match is found. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0418" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0418&rsqb;</number> The contents and destination of each shipping box is identified. Each blood product unit is scanned before going into the shipping box. When the capacity of the box is reached, a shipping label is printed. A record of each shipping box identification and its contents are also stored in a database. </paragraph>
