The paper can be formed from laminated rolls of polymeric media that are roller die cut, inked, aligned, bonded, and cut to an appropriate size. The paper is formed from layers that define a hidden reservoir and a visible reservoir for each of an array of print cells that form a grid on the paper. A ferrofluidic coloring fluid is permanently contained within the paper and can move from the hidden reservoir to the visible reservoir. The size of the cells define the resolution of the paper. Initially, the paper appears white. However, after passing a writing instrument, such as a stylus, over desired print cells, these cells switch from a first hidden bistable state to a second visible bistable state. In the second visible bistable state, the ferrofluidic coloring fluid forms a desired image in a desired color or colors. </paragraph>

The second encapsulating layer may also be coated with a conductive material, or made of a conductive material, and may or may not be patterned. The gyricon sheet and two encapsulating layers comprise a sheet of gyricon electric paper on which images can be written and erased repeatedly. The patterned charge-retaining islands of the first encapsulating layer receive electric charges from an external charge-transfer device. After the charge-transfer device is removed, the conductive, charge-retaining islands hold electric charge, creating an electric field in the electric paper sufficient to cause an image change. </paragraph>

Sheridon, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, discloses a method of addressing a sheet of a rotating element sheet material that has a reduced applied electric field requirement when a gyricon sheet using magnetic trapping. A magnetic trapping gyricon sheet comprises a substrate with a plurality of rotatable elements disposed in the substrate. The elements comprise at least two portions, each portion having an associated optical modulation characteristic and the optical modulation characteristics of at least one portion are different from the optical modulation characteristic of at least one other portion. Importantly, one portion is magnetized, and the element also has an anisotropy for providing an electrical dipole moment. The electrical dipole moment renders the element electrically responsive such that when the rotating element is rotatably disposed in an electric field while the electrical dipole moment of the element is provided, the element tends to rotate to an orientation in which the electrical dipole moment aligns with the field. A small additional magnet is associated with each of the elements. When the magnetized portion of the element is the portion of the element nearest the additional magnet a magnetic attractive force will exist between the additional magnetized means and the magnetized portion of the element. A magnetic field is applied to the sheet in the vicinity of at least one of the rotatable elements and its associated magnet to reduce the magnetic attractive force therebetween. When the magnetic field has been reduced then applying a reduced electric field in the vicinity of at least one rotatable element will cause the rotatable element to align with the electric field. </paragraph>

Sheridon, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, discloses a method of making rotating element sheet material utilizing magnetic latching. First a plurality of rotating elements having a magnetized segment are mixed with magnetic particles to attract the magnetic particles to the magnetized segments. Then the rotating elements with the attached magnetic particles are mixed with a liquid elastomer. A magnetic field is applied to orient the rotating elements in a common direction. When the rotating elements and the attached magnetic particles have all been oriented the elastomer is cured to form an elastomer substrate with trapped rotating elements and magnetic particles. The elastomer substrate is then immersed into a bath of dielectric plasticizer which is absorbed more readily by elastomer than by the rotating elements. The elastomer substrate swells to create plasticizer-filled voids around the rotating elements. The magnetic particles remain incorporated within the elastomer to form magnetic material pads which are associated with an element. </paragraph>

Richley, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, discloses a rotation mechanism for bichromal balls in a twisting ball display based on electrostatic induction. A bichromal ball with hemispherically differentiated electrical time constants is immersed in a dielectric liquid containing a charge director solution. The liquid is contained within an encapsulant. The charge director solution has positive and negative ions with substantially different mobilities. Space charge clouds created in this fluid upon application of an electric field act so as to induce polarization differently in each hemisphere, leading to a net dynamic polarization. Interaction between the space charge and the induced polarization serves to rotate the ball. Ions are subsequently trapped at the fluid/encapsulant interface due to greater polarizability of the encapsulant. A threshold is obtained by the excess field needed to release the ions and so reverse the ion motion. </paragraph>

Any attempt to erase a writing on the top sheet of electric paper results in the pattern on the bottom sheet of electric paper being erased. Therefore any tampering by erasure of a writing on the tamper-evident electric paper is revealed by the absence of a portion of the pattern on the bottom sheet of electric paper. Single sheet tamper-evident electric paper has a complex pattern, such as an encryption, printed on a single sheet of electric paper. Any attempt to erase a writing on the electric paper also erases a portion of the encryption, thereby providing evidence of tampering. </paragraph>

Mackinlay, and Maureen C. Stone, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, discloses a method of making a substrate in which sets of optically anisotropic spheroidal balls are disposed, as for use in an electrical twisting ball display. First and second sets of spheroidal balls are deposited on a receiving surface composed of an elastomer substrate material in an adhesive state, the spheroidal balls thus deposited adhering to the receiving surface. Balls of the first and second sets are physically distinguishable from one another. Balls of the first set can be deposited in a first arrangement, and balls of the second set, in a second arrangement. Each ball of each set has an optical anisotropy and an anisotropy for providing an electrical dipole moment, the electrical dipole moment rendering the ball electrically responsive such that when the ball is rotatably disposed in an electric field while the electrical dipole moment of the ball is provided, the ball tends to rotate to an orientation in which the electrical dipole moment aligns with the field. With the balls thus deposited, additional liquid elastomer material is poured over the balls adhering to the receiving surface, thereby covering the balls and forming an uncured substrate material in which the balls are disposed. This uncured substrate material is cured to form a substrate in which balls of the first and second sets are disposed. A plasticizer fluid can be applied to the substrate thus formed, thereby expanding the substrate so as to render the balls disposed in the substrate rotatable within the substrate. </paragraph>

Sheridon and Joseph Crowley and published in Canada on Dec. 27, 1998 as Publication No. 2228920, the disclosures of which are totally incorporated herein by reference, discloses a gyricon or twisting-particle display based on nonspherodial (e.g. substantially cylindrical) optically anisotropic particles disposed in a substrate. The particles can be either bichromal or polychromal cylinders, preferably aligned parallel to one another and packed close together in a monolayer. A rotatable disposition of each particle is achievable while the particle is thus disposed in the substrate; for example, the particles can already be rotatable in the substrate, or can be rendered rotatable in the substrate by a nondestructive operation performed on the substrate. In particular, the substrate can be made up of an elastomer that is expanded by application of a fluid thereto so as to render the particles rotatable therein. A particle, when in its rotatable disposition, is not attached to the substrate. The close-packed monolayer configuration of particles provides excellent brightness characteristics and relative ease of manufacture as compared with certain other high-brightness gyricon displays. The substrate containing the cylinders can be fabricated with the swelled-elastomer techniques known from spherical-particle gyricon displays, with a simple agitation process step being used to align the cylinders within the sheeting material, Techniques for fabricating the cylinders are also disclosed.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> wherein n is an integer representing the number of repeat &mdash;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&mdash; units and R is &mdash;H or &mdash;CH&boxH;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, said particles being free to migrate within said suspending fluid under the influence of an electric field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Photochromism in general is a reversible change of a single chemical species between two states having distinguishably different absorption spectra, wherein the change is induced in at least one direction by the action of electromagnetic radiation. The inducing radiation, as well as the changes in the absorption spectra, are usually in the ultraviolet, visible, or infrared regions. In some instances, the change in one direction is thermally induced. The single chemical species can be a molecule or an ion, and the reversible change in states can be a conversion between two molecules or ions, or the dissociation of a single molecule or ion into two or more species, with the reverse change being a recombination of the two or more species thus formed into the original molecule or ion. Photochromic phenomena are observed in both organic compounds, such as anils, disulfoxides, hydrazones, oxazones, semicarbazones, stilbene derivatives, o-nitrobenzyl derivatives, Spiro compounds, and the like, and in inorganic compounds, such as metal oxides, alkaline earth metal sulfides, titanates, mercury compounds, copper compounds, minerals, transition metal compounds such as carbonyls, and the like. Photochromic materials are known in applications such as photochromic glasses, which are useful as, for example, ophthalmic lenses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Electric reusable paper can be defined as any electronically addressable display medium that approximates paper in form and function. Electric reusable paper ideally is light-weight, thin, and flexible, and ideally it displays images indefinitely while consuming little or no power. In addition, electric reusable ideally is reusable so that the user is able to erase images and create new ones repeatedly. Preferably, electric reusable paper displays images using reflected light and allows a very wide viewing angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> One form of electric paper uses an electrophoretic ink. Electrophoresis is defined as the movement of charged particles suspended in a suspending fluid under the influence of an applied electric field. If the electric field is applied between electrodes in a cell, the particles will migrate, depending on their polarity, to either the cathode or the anode while the suspending fluid remains essentially stationary. When a coincident voltage is applied to selected electrodes, the particles in the suspending fluid migrate under the influence of the electric field to the electrode having a polarity opposite from their own. Since the selection of electrodes will generally relate to an image or pattern, the particles form an image or pattern. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In some specific embodiments of electrophoretic inks, the particles and suspending fluid can be encapsulated within microcapsules. In these embodiments, the particles migrate through the suspending fluid within the microcapsule under the influence of an applied electric field. The microcapsules can be incorporated within a binder and applied to a wide variety of substrates, including flexible and nonplanar substrates. In an encapsulated electrophoretic display, the binder material surrounds the capsules and separates the two bounding electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In other specific embodiments of electrophoretic inks, the suspending fluid containing the particles can be directly dispersed or emulsified into a binder (or a precursor to the binder material) to form what can be called a &ldquo;polymer-dispersed electrophoretic display&rdquo;. In such displays, the individual electrophoretic phases can be referred to as &ldquo;capsules&rdquo; or &ldquo;microcapsules&rdquo; even though no capsule membrane is present. Such polymer-dispersed electrophoretic displays are considered to be subsets of encapsulated electrophoretic displays. </paragraph>

The particles are mixed with a light transparent liquid which is subsequently cured to form an elastomeric or rigid slab. Following curing of the liquid, the slab is emersed in a plasticizer (dielectric liquid) which is absorbed by the slab and which causes the slab to expand slightly. Expansion of the slab around the particles provides a plasticizer-filled cavity around each particle which cavities allow the particles to rotate to provide a display in accordance with their optical anisotropy but does not allow substantial translation of the particles. </paragraph>

No. 4,261,653 (Goodrich), the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, discloses a light valve formed of a plurality of spherical dipolar particles suspended in a matrix material. Each spherical dipolar particle has a unified body formed in three discrete symmetrical sections. A central section is configured to permit light transmission when in a first orientation with respect to a path of light travel, and generally not permit light transmission when in a second, transverse orientation with respect to the path of light travel. A pair of intermediate sections bound the central section and are formed of a transparent material having an electrical permittivity that varies through a range of values as a function of the frequency of an applied electric field. A pair of outer sections bounds the intermediate sections and are formed of a material having a relatively stable electrical permittivity within the range of values of the intermediate sections. An applied electric field at one frequency extreme will cause the spherical dipolar particle to align in the first orientation to permit light transmission, and an applied electric field in the other frequency extreme will cause the particle to anti-align in the second, transverse orientation to shutter or reflect light. The matrix material is preferably formed of a plasticized elastomer that has a plurality of expanded cavities, with each cavity containing an outer lubricating layer to allow free rotational motion of a dipolar particle in the cavity. The use of a light valve of the present invention and method of manufacturing the spherical dipolar particle construction are also disclosed. </paragraph>

A high molecular weight hardenable coating material which is soluble in the low viscosity liquid is then poured onto the coated ball members to cover the layer. Then, the low viscosity liquid is removed and the hardenable coating material is caused to harden. The thin coating is then dissolved away from portions of the ball members to leave cavity portions thereabout into which a high resistivity liquid is introduced. The resulting ball members have a refractive index on the colored layer which is substantially the same as the refractive index of the high resistivity liquid contained in the cavities. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,197,228 (Sheridon), the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, discloses a method of making rotating element sheet material utilizing magnetic latching. First a plurality of rotating elements, each element having a magnetized segment, are mixed with an elastomer and a plurality of magnetic particles to attract the magnetic particles to the magnetized segments. Then a magnetic field is applied to orient the elements in a common direction. When the rotating elements have all been oriented in a common direction, they are held in that orientation for a long enough period of time to allow the magnetic particles to migrate in the elastomer to the regions of the elastomer in the vicinity of the magnetized segments of the elements. The elastomer is then cured to form an elastomer substrate with trapped rotating elements and magnetic particles. The elastomer substrate is then immersed into a bath of dielectric plasticizer which is absorbed more readily by elastomer than by the rotating elements. The elastomer substrate swells to create plasticizer-filled voids around the rotating elements. The magnetic particles remain incorporated within the elastomer to form magnetic material pads which are associated with an element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,055,091 (Sheridon et al.), the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference, discloses a gyricon or twisting-particle display based on nonspheroidal (e.g., substantially cylindrical) optically anisotropic particles disposed in a substrate. The particles can be bichromal cylinders, preferably aligned parallel to one another and packed close together in a monolayer. A rotatable disposition of each particle is achievable while the particle is thus disposed in the substrate, for example, the particles can already be rotatable in the substrate, or can be rendered rotatable in the substrate by a nondestructive operation performed on the substrate. In particular, the substrate can be made up of an elastomer that is expanded by application of a fluid thereto so as to render the particles rotatable therein. A particle, when in its rotatable disposition, is not attached to the substrate. The close-packed monolayer configuration of particles provides excellent brightness characteristics and relative ease of manufacture as compared with certain other high-brightness gyricon displays. The substrate containing the cylinders can be fabricated with the swelled-elastomer techniques known from spherical-particle gyricon displays, with a simple agitation process step being used to align the cylinders within the sheeting material. Techniques for fabricating the cylinders are also disclosed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> at numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrates a section of an electrophoretic ink display panel suitable for the present invention. It is to be understood that the panel section at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has been greatly magnified for the sake of explanation and illustration. Reference numeral <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a substrate or support means of any desired or suitable material, such as glass, polystyrene, or any other suitable nonconductor. The thickness of support <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is not critical but it should have sufficient strength to support the elements which are mounted upon it. Support means <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is generally planar and conductive lines <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are placed thereon parallel to each other in the manner shown. The conductive lines are insulated from each other and bonded to substrate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by an epoxy or other adhesive <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Each conductive line is coated with an insulating layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> which has been abraded to expose the top of the conductive material. Then portions of the conductive material and insulating layer are etched away so that each wire line is contained in a trough or reservoir made of the insulating material <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The volume above the conductive material in the trough is filled with a suspending fluid or electrophoretic ink <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which can contain particles of one color or a mixture of different colored particles, at least some of the particles contain a photochromic material and a chelating agent in accordance with the present invention. The suspending fluid can be clear or opaque, and can also contain a control liquid or additive for charging the particles dispersed therein. A suspending fluid containing a dye of contrasting color with the particles dissolved in a solvent dye can be employed to increase contrast. Overlying the suspending fluid and in an electrical contact therewith are transparent conductors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Lastly, a layer of transparent material <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> such as glass or the like from which side the panel is viewed overlies the transparent conductors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> The conductive material of conductive lines <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be any desired or effective electrically conductive material, such as aluminum, copper, silver, platinum, brass, steel alloys, or the like. Insulating material <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> preferably is selected so that it is capable of withstanding the etching agents used to form the trough. The transparent conductors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> can comprise thin layers of tin oxide, copper oxide, copper iodide, gold, or the like either alone or on a transparent substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2C</cross-reference> are side views of a single conductive line <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with suspending fluid <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> having particles in suspension filling the trough or reservoir formed by insulating material <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and conductor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Transparent conductor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> overlies the trough and glass layer <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> in turn overlies the transparent conductor. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> the particles have been arbitrarily given polarity signs for purposes of explanation. Moreover, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> represents the particles as being randomly dispersed within the dielectric fluid. A charge control agent or additive may or may not be needed to give the particles the desired charge, since particles can be chosen which take on an initial charge triboelectrically in the fluid. When a positive source of potential is applied to terminal A and a negative source of potential is applied to terminal B as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, an electric field is established across the electrodes. Under the influence of the electric field, the particles having a negative charge migrate toward the positive electrode, whereas the particles having a positive charge migrate toward the negative electrode, resulting in an image which is the reverse of the other on each of the electrodes. Upon reversal of the electric field as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, the particles migrate to the terminal having a polarity opposite to their own. For a period of time after the removal of the electric field, the particles adhere to the electrode toward which they have migrated. To clear or erase the electrode, a potential of the same polarity as the particle is applied to the electrode. During this operation, the other electrode can be maintained at ground potential. The amount of particles adhering to the electrodes is a function of the applied voltage as well as the number of available particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference> shows a side view of a single conductive line such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2C</cross-reference> with the exception that a monochromic fluid dye <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>&prime; is utilized in lieu of one of the color particles of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2C</cross-reference>. In other respects <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference> is identical to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2C</cross-reference>. Assuming that the particles in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference> have a positive polarity as shown, when a negative potential is applied to terminal A and ground to terminal B, the particles will migrate toward the upper electrode in sufficient numbers to furnish an indication of a color change in the conductive line different from its previous condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> It is understood that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> represent only a portion of an actual electrophoretic color display device. In an actual display panel, the conductive lines and the transparent conductors are far more numerous, giving access to more panel coordinates. In the actual display device, numerous segments of the panel are addressed or scanned sequentially or simultaneously so as to build up visual information on the panel. The voltage to individual address terminals can also be modulated to control the brightness of the panel and to furnish degrees of contrast and resolution of visual data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> It is further understood that a solid dielectric layer can overcoat the electrodes, preventing them from contacting the suspending fluid. In such an event, the dielectric layer can serve to avoid any adverse effects that the suspending fluid may have on the electrodes (e.g. corrosion) or to furnish the required insulating properties under certain voltage conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> In a specific embodiment of the present invention, the suspending fluid and the particles containing the spiropyran and chelating agent according to the present invention are contained within one or more microcapsules. When microcapsules are situated in a binder or matrix, the microcapsules can be of two or more types. For example, some microcapsules can contain particles of one color while other microcapsules contain particles of another color, or some microcapsules can have a colored suspending fluid while other microcapsules have a colorless suspending fluid, or some microcapsules can contain one set of particles while other microcapsules contain two or more sets of differently colored particles, or combinations thereof, or the like. </paragraph>

In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A, a</cross-reference> display <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a pair of planar electrodes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> which reside on opposite sides of a substantially planar arrangement of microscopic containers, or microcapsules, <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>. At least electrode <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is visually substantially transparent so that a viewer can observe the color exhibited by portions of the microcapsules <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> adjacent to electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. For example, electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can comprise a semiconductor such as indium tin oxide evaporated or otherwise coated in a thin layer onto glass, MYLAR&reg;, or other transparent substrates; the details of fabrication are well known to those skilled in the art, as are possible semiconductor alternatives to indium tin oxide (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,668,106 and 4,305,807, the disclosures of each of which are totally incorporated herein by reference). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Within each microcapsule <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> is an electrophoretic suspension comprising a suspending fluid <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and a quantity of particles <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight>, the suspending fluid and the particles contrasting visually (i.e., exhibiting observably distinguishable colors or shades) and the particles containing a spiropyran and a chelating agent according to the present invention. A driver circuit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to electrodes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and is capable of creating a sufficient potential difference between the electrodes to cause migration of particles <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> to one or the other electrode within an acceptable switching time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> To impart the color of particles <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> to the display <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, driver circuit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> creates an electric field (indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>) whose direction is such that particles <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> are attracted to, and migrate toward, electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, microcapsules <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> are spherical and substantially tangent to one another; accordingly, if each microcapsule <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> contains a quantity of particles <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> sufficient to cover half the inner surface area under the influence of an electric field, attraction of particles <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> toward electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> will impart the color of the particles to display <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in a substantially uniform, uninterrupted manner. Microcapsules of shapes other than spherical, and dispositions of microcapsules other than substantially tangent to one another, are also suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> The display <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be formed, for example, in the manner of fabricating liquid-crystal displays. For example, after their formation, microcapsules <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> containing the suspending fluid and the particles can be injected into a cell housing two spaced-apart electrodes. Alternatively, microcapsules <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be &ldquo;printed&rdquo; into a display by any of various methods known in the art, such as the techniques used to deposit pressure-rupturable microcapsules onto a substrate to create carbonless copy paper, in this case, the microcapsules are printed onto one of the electrodes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, after which the other electrode is deposited, printed, or otherwise coated on top of the deposited microcapsules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, microcapsules <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> are immobilized within a transparent matrix or binder <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> that is itself sandwiched between electrodes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Once again, application of the appropriately directed electric field results in migration of particles <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> toward transparent electrode <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. So long as microcapsules <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> are dispersed within matrix <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> uniformly and at sufficient density, the resulting visual appearance will be uniform. Matrix <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is preferably a transparent polymeric material that can be cured (i.e., cross-linked from a low-viscosity state into extremely high viscosity) or otherwise solidified at relatively low temperatures, and which readily accepts, in its low-viscosity state, a dispersion of microcapsules. Useful materials include polyvinyl alcohols, gelatins, epoxies, and other resins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> The low-viscosity polymer precursor, into which microcapsules <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> have been suspended at an adequate dispersion density, can be cured in a mold conforming to the two-dimensional or curved shape of electrodes <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, or can instead utilize the electrodes as containment boundaries for an in-situ cure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, microcapsules <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> can be voids or microscopic cavities in matrix <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> formed during its cure. For example, the electrophoretic ink comprising the suspending fluid and the particles can be dispersed as an emulsion in the uncured (low-viscosity) precursor to matrix <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>; curing of the precursor leaves the emulsion droplets suspended and immobilized within the matrix, effectively forming a polymer-dispersed electrophoretic display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> The display can be arranged in any number of configurations, including a unitary, continuous display (i.e., a contiguous extent of microcapsules sandwiched between a single electrode pair); a row or other pattern of discrete groups of microcapsules controlled by a single electrode pair; or multiple-element arrangements containing a plurality of independently addressable display elements, each controlled by a separate electrode pair and comprising, for example, a single continuous display or a pattern of microcapsule groups. Driver <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be any suitable power supply, e.g., a DC or pulsed DC circuit, or an AC circuit (where the pulse width or AC period is greater than the switching time of the electrophoretic composition). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an electrophoretic microcapsule containing particles of a single type or color. A transparent electrode <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and a rear electrode <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> can be selectively and oppositely biased such that a quantity of charged, colored particles <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> comprising a spiropyran and a chelating agent according to the present invention contained within the microcapsule <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> translate either toward or away from one of the electrodes through the dyed suspending fluid <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. In one such configuration, particles <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> are drawn toward transparent electrode <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, rendering them visible. In the opposite configuration, particles <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> are drawn toward rear electrode <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, causing them to be obscured by dyed suspending fluid <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> show electrophoretic microcapsules containing particles of multiple types or colors. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, electrophoretic microcapsule <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> contains a suspending fluid <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> in which are dispersed a quantity of charged particles <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of one color containing a spiropyran or chelating agent according to the present invention and a similar quantity of uncharged particles <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of a different or visually contrasting color. Transparent electrode <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and rear electrode <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> can be biased such that charged, colored particles <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> are translated either toward electrode <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, in which case their color predominates; or toward electrode <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, in which case the color of particles <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> predominates (since particles <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> are hidden beneath particles <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>). In this embodiment, the spiropyran and chelating agent can be contained in either the charged particles <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> as shown or in the uncharged particles <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>B, particles <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and differently colored particles <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> can carry opposite charges, creating a push-pull effect that enhances the visibility of particles attracted to electrode <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and reduces visual interference from the other particles. As another alternative, the different sets of particles can have the same charge sign but different charge magnitudes. In all of these embodiments, the electrophoretic mobility of particles <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and particles <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> are substantially different. By &ldquo;substantially different&rdquo; as used herein is meant that less than about 25 percent, and preferably less than about 5 percent, of the particles of one color have the same or similar electrophoretic mobilities as the particles of the other color. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a system that does not require a top transparent electrode <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, and is therefore termed a &ldquo;rear-addressed&rdquo; systems. Three electrodes <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> lie in a substantially coplanar orientation with respect to a microcapsule <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, or can be closely spaced to one another around the exterior surface of the microcapsule. A potential applied to one of the electrodes will induce an opposite charge in the other electrodes, so long as the other electrodes are effectively connected to the ground return of the driven electrode. Microcapsule <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> contains quantities of oppositely charged and differently colored particles <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, wherein one of <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> contains a spiropyran and chelating agent according to the present invention. If electrode <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> is biased negatively, electrodes <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> are correspondingly biased positively relative to electrode <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>; accordingly, particles <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> will be oriented in the manner illustrated. By successively biasing electrode <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and then electrode <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> negatively, particles <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> will be drawn across the bottom of microcapsule <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, adjacent to the plane of the electrodes, forcing microcapsules <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> toward the upper region of the microcapsule; effectively, the particles <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> are commutated along the path defined by electrodes <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. A similar procedure with positive instead of negative bias will cause the opposite color orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates another example of a &ldquo;rear-addressed&rdquo; system.

Such a system is viewed from above, and electrodes <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> can thus be opaque and do not affect the optical characteristics of the display. </paragraph>

The binder containing the microcapsules can be applied to a substrate uniformly, or it can be applied in an image pattern. Further, the binder containing the microcapsules can be manufactured into strings and threads suitable for weaving into textiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The present invention also encompasses encapsulated electrophoretic ink displays wherein the suspending fluid containing the particles is directly dispersed or emulsified into a binder (or a precursor to the binder material) to form what can be called a &ldquo;polymer-dispersed electrophoretic display&rdquo;. In such displays, the individual electrophoretic phases can be referred to as &ldquo;capsules&rdquo; or &ldquo;microcapsules&rdquo; even though no capsule membrane is present. Such polymer-dispersed electrophoretic displays are considered to be subsets of encapsulated electrophoretic displays. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> If desired, an optional charge control agent or additive can be added to the particle suspension to increase particle charge in suspension or make more of the particles charge to one polarity. Examples of suitable charge control agents include (but are not limited to) linseed oil; alkyd resins; polyamide resins such as VERSAMID&reg;; polyethylene; shellac; organic sulfates and sulfonates, including (but not limited to) bis(2-ethyl hexyl) sodium sulfosuccinate, sodium dihexyl sulfosuccinate, sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate, calcium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, calcium petroleum sulfonate, neutral or basic barium dinonylnaphthalene sulfonate, neutral or basic calcium dinonylnaphthalene sulfonate, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid sodium salt, ammonium lauryl sulfate, and the like; basic or neutral barium petronate; calcium petronate; the cobalt, calcium, copper, manganese, nickel, zinc, and iron salts of naphthenic acid; the barium, aluminum, zinc, copper, lead, chromium, calcium, and iron salts of stearic acid; the lithium, cadmium, calcium, manganese, magnesium, and zinc salts of heptanoic acid; the barium, aluminum, cobalt, manganese, zinc, cerium, and zirconium salts of 2-ethyl hexanoic acid (these are known as metal octoates); aluminum diisopropyl salicylate; aluminum t-butyl salicylate; aluminum resinate; aluminum salts of 3,5 di-t-butyl gamma resorcylic acid; block and comb copolymers, including (but not limited to) AB diblock copolymers of (A) polymers of 2-(N,N)-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate quaternized with methyl-p-toluenesulfonate and (B) poly-2-ethylhexyl methacrylate, comb graft copolymers with oil soluble tails of poly (12-hydroxystearic acid) and having a molecular weight of about 1800 pendant on an oil-soluble anchor group of poly (methyl methacrylate-methacrylic acid), and the like; organic amides, including (but not limited to) polyisobutylene succinimides such as OLOA 1200, N-vinyl pyrrolidone polymers, and the like; organic zwitterions, including (but not limited to) lecithin and the like, organic phosphates and phosphonates, including (but not limited to) the sodium salts of phosphated mono- and di-glycerides with saturated and unsaturated acid substituents, and the like; and the like, as well as mixtures thereof. Charge adjuvants such as stearates, metallic soap additives, polybutylene succinimides, and the like are also described in references such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,707,429, 4,702,984, and 4,702,985, the disclosures of each of which are totally incorporated herein by reference. When present, the optional charge control agent is present in the electrophoretic ink in any desired or effective amount, typically at least about 0.001 percent by weight of the electrophoretic ink, and preferably at least about 0.01 percent by weight of the electrophoretic ink, and typically no more than about 3 percent by weight of the electrophoretic ink, and preferably no more than about 0.8 percent by weight of the electrophoretic ink, although the amount can be outside of these ranges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> In non-aqueous solutions, some surface active materials used as charge control additives are often amphoteric in that the charge they impart to a surface depends upon a balance between the properties of the charge control additive and the surface constituents of the particle. For example, lecithin, a common charge control additive, will charge some particles positively and some particles negatively, depending upon the reactivity of the particle surface. Thus, it is possible to impart opposite charges to different colored particles in the same suspending fluid with the same charge control additive, provided that the surfaces of the two sets of particles are properly chosen. When stabilizing polymers are employed to provide the necessary functional groups on the surfaces of the particles, the layer of stabilizer can have a thickness of from about 10 to about 1,000 Angstroms, and preferably from about 40 to about 200 Angstroms. Suitable stabilizing polymers include poly(2-ethylhexylmethacrylate), poly(isobutylene), polypropylene, and the like. Stabilizer materials can also be added to the electrophoretic ink containing both positively charged particles and negatively charged particles to prevent excessive flocculation of the particles caused by the mutual attraction that results from their opposite polarities. Although the positive and negative particles will frequently flocculate in the absence of a field, their mutual attraction can be weakened by means of stabilizers, so that they will separate when in the presence of the electric field. Specific stabilizers include polymeric materials that are soluble in the suspending fluid. These polymers are attached to the surfaces of the particles by means of covalent bonds or by physical adsorption. When the particles are composed solely of pigment particles, the stabilizers attach directly thereto; when the particles comprise both resin and pigment components, the stabilizers will generally be attached to the resin materials within the particles. In addition, the stabilizer material can comprise one component soluble in the suspending fluid, which component is attached to a second component capable of attaching to the particle; for example, a stabilizer can consist of a block copolymer, in which one block constitutes the component soluble in the suspending fluid and the other block constitutes the portion capable of attaching to the particle. Examples of such polymers include SOLSPERSE polymers available from ICF, CRAYTON G701 polymers available from Shell Chemical Company, and poly(styrene-b-butylene). In either case, in the suspending fluid, the polymer molecules extend to form long chains as a result of the salvation forces, or the attraction of the solvent molecules to the polymers. Provided that these polymer chains are of sufficient length, they act as steric stabilizers, and create a repulsive barrier that maintains a sufficient distance between the particles to prevent flocculation when the electrophoretic ink is under the influence of an electric field. Additional examples of suitable polymeric materials include polydimethylsiloxane, poly(vinyl toluene), poly(2-ethylhexylmethacrylate-g-N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone), poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate-g-ethyl acrylate), and the like. In some instances, the same material can act as both the steric stabilizer and as the charge control additive. Examples of such materials are OLOA 1200 and lecithin. The polymers can have a molecular weight of from about 10,000 to about 100,000 to ensure that the chains are of sufficient length to separate the particles. Further details concerning particles having stabilizing copolymers attached thereto and processes for making the same are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,476,210, the disclosure of which is totally incorporated herein by reference. Compositions comprising oppositely charged electrophoretically moveable particles of different colors suspended in a liquid medium are also disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,877,698, 4,830,945, and 4,880,720, the disclosures of each of which are totally incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>

Ethanol was added until the solids dissolved at reflux temperature, followed by addition of triethylamine (0.280 gram, 2.78 mmol) in 5 milliliters of ethanol via the dropping funnel over 20 minutes. Addition of the base resulted in an immediate color change to purple, signifying that spiropyran formation was occurring. The mixture was refluxed for 6 hours and then cooled to room temperature. The volume was concentrated to 5 milliliters before cooling the flask to 0&deg; C. in a refrigerator for 24 hours. The spiropyran precipitate was filtered under vacuum and recrystallized from ethanol to give yellow crystals of 6-nitro-N-(2-carboxyethyl)spirobenzoindolinopyran, yield 0.763 grams (72.2 percent), melting point 192-194&deg; C. <highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>H NMR, <highlight><superscript>13</superscript></highlight>C NMR, IR, and UV-visible spectra indicated the following: </paragraph>
