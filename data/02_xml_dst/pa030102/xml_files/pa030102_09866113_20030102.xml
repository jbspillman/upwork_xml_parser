<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to antenna loops, more particularly, it relates to an antenna loop structure comprising a plurality of <custom-character file="US20030001824A1-20030102-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00002"/>-shaped segmental antennas, wherein each pair of immediate neighboring segmental antennas is phase-inverted to counteract each other for eliminating effect of external electromagnetic interference (EMI). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A wireless digitizer tablet is basically a circuit board composed of equidistance-spaced antenna loops aligned in a lattice array based on X-Y coordinates. The digitizer tablet is designed to receive electromagnetic waves emitted from a wireless stylus and calculate the absolute coordinates of the wireless stylus. As illustrated in a schematic distribution chart of the antenna loop in a conventional digitizer tablet (in X-axis only) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, one end of every antenna loop <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected with a switch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> while the other end is grounded, wherein the ON/OFF operation of the switch <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is controlled for detection of a signal induced in each antenna loop <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As it is well known however that the magnetic intensity is in inverse proportion to square of distance, hence, the farther the wireless stylus leaves from the antenna loop, the weaker is the signal to be received by the latter and vice versa. Basing on this relationship between the magnetic intensity and the distance, the coordinates of the wireless stylus may be calculated to thereby obtain the exact location of the stylus by analyzing the signal received by each antenna loop after a sequential scanning of all the antenna loops is made by a microprocessor in the digitizer tablet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In today&apos;s high-speed data transmission environments, electromagnetic interference (EMI) has become extraordinarily conspicuous and more seriously. For example, under a large scale digitizer tablet, a good number of antenna loops is buried, and for reducing the quantity of the antenna switch, the <custom-character file="US20030001824A1-20030102-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00003"/>-shaped antenna loops in relatively longer length are adopted which are more liable to be interfered by EMI, particularly by the EM waves radiated from some computer peripherals, especially the monitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is until now a very important issue: &ldquo;How can people do better to eliminate more efficiently the external EMI of a digitizer tablet&quest;&rdquo;</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An antenna loop structure is usually composed of a plurality of <custom-character file="US20030001824A1-20030102-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00006"/>-shaped segmental antennas, and the antenna loop structure of this invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> comprises 12 sets of antenna loops from a loop X<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> all the way up to a loop X<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, wherein each antenna loop further comprises a plurality of <custom-character file="US20030001824A1-20030102-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00007"/>-shaped segmental antennas <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and any pair of immediate neighboring <custom-character file="US20030001824A1-20030102-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00008"/>-shaped segmental antennas belongs to two different antenna loops respectively. For example, two <custom-character file="US20030001824A1-20030102-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00009"/>-shaped segmental antennas <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (A, B) are enclosed by antenna loop X<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, X<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and X<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, X<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> individually, so that when a stylus is found located at the position (A) of the antenna loop X<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, it can be identified by examining its neighboring segmental antennas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Regarding the technology of this invention for eliminating electromagnetic interference (EMI) as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, as every pair of immediate neighboring <custom-character file="US20030001824A1-20030102-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00010"/>-shaped segmental antennas is phase-inverted to each other so that when noise of EMI is incurred in the antenna loop structure of this invention, two voltages equal in magnitude but opposite in polarity are induced in every two immediate neighboring segmental antennas to therefore counteract each other and eliminate the noise. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(A) indicates that every antenna loop is composed of a plurality of <custom-character file="US20030001824A1-20030102-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00011"/>-shaped segmental antennas in an even number while that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(B) in an odd number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In short, by taking advantage of the paired <custom-character file="US20030001824A1-20030102-P00900.TIF" wi="20" he="20" id="custom-character-00012"/>-shaped segmental antennas that will create opposite voltages to counteract each other in every antenna loop, a whatever large scale digitizer tablet will become immune from EMI noise to some extent. </paragraph>
