<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This application generally relates to composite articles that are joined together using brazes. More particularly, the invention described herein relates to bonded niobium-based silicide and molybdenum-based silicide composite articles that are joined together using semi-solid brazes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Nickel (Ni)-based superalloys have been used as jet engine materials for many years. The surface temperatures at the hottest locations of state-of-the-art jet engine turbine airfoils now approach 1150&deg; C., which is approximately 85% of the melting temperatures of Ni-based superalloys. Niobium (Nb) and molybdenum (Mo) based refractory metal intermetallic composites (hereinafter referred as &ldquo;Nb-based RMICs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mo-based RMICs,&rdquo; respectively) have much higher potential application temperatures, provided that they can be used at approximately 80% or more of their melting temperatures, which are generally greater than about 1700&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Complex silicide-based RMICs made from Nb&mdash;Si&mdash;Ti&mdash;Hf&mdash;Cr&mdash;Al alloys or Mo&mdash;Si&mdash;B&mdash;Cr alloys show high promise to become the next generation turbine materials with a long term, high-temperature capability that is significantly higher than that of current Ni-based superalloys. Because of their high melting temperatures, however, direct casting of hollow engine components with cooling channels from these Nb- and Mo-based RMICs is expected to be very difficult. At such high temperatures, very few materials can serve as casting cores and molds without experiencing creep, cracking, or reactions with the molten metals (thus contaminating the melt and degrading the cores). One potential alternative technique for the manufacture of complex-shaped components (e.g. airfoils) with cooling channels is to bond together, typically using a braze, two or more structural members that have been machined to the appropriate shapes. Currently, however, no such braze materials exist for these Nb- and Mo-based RMICs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is known in the art to make hollow components, such as turbine blades, by joining and bonding halves or multiple pieces together. However, the prior-art braze materials that have been developed for Ni-based or Fe-based alloys are not suitable for use with the new Nb- and Mo-based silicide composites, which have very different alloy compositions and much higher working temperatures. Detrimental interactions are known to occur between nickel brazes, for example, and Nb-based RMICs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need in the art for improved high temperature composite articles that are joined together using brazes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> An article <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as an airfoil, that is adapted for exposure to high-temperature conditions, typically greater than about 1000&deg; C., includes a first piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a second piece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In an exemplary embodiment, article <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is an airfoil, for example a double-walled airfoil, for use within a hot gas path of a turbine assembly. Article <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be a component, such as a diffuser, casing, seal ring structure, or the like that is intended for use in a turbine assembly or any other structure in which temperatures in excess of about 1000&deg; C. are encountered. Article <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a melting temperature of at least about 1500&deg; C., and, preferably, at least about 1700&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> First piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made of a first niobium silicide-based refractory intermetallic composite (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Nb-based RMIC&rdquo;) or a first molybdenum silicide based intermetallic composite (hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;Mo-based RMIC&rdquo;). The first Nb-based RMIC typically comprises titanium, hafnium, silicon, chromium, and niobium and first Mo-based RMIC typically comprises molybdenum, silicon, and at least one of chromium and boron. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Second piece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is joined by a braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to first piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Second piece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is made of a second Nb-based RMIC or a second Mo-based RMIC. The second Nb-based RMIC typically comprises titanium, hafnium, silicon, chromium, and niobium, and the second Mo-based RMIC typically comprises molybdenum, silicon, and at least one of chromium and boron. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The Nb-based RMICs that are used to form the article <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention possess a good balance of oxidation resistance and mechanical properties. The Nb-based RMICs preferably have compositions in the range of: between about 20 and about 30 atomic percent titanium; between about 13 and about 20 atomic percent silicon; between about 2 and about 10 atomic percent hafnium; between about 1 and about 12 atomic percent chromium; between about 1 and about 3 atomic percent aluminum; and between about 5 and about 7 atomic percent boron; with the balance comprising niobium. In order to provide even greater oxidation resistance, these alloys may optionally contain greater amounts of chromium and aluminum. In addition, the Nb-based RMICs may further include up to about 4 atomic percent Ge, and up to about 6 atomic percent each of Mo, Ta, V, W, Fe, Sn, and Zr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, the Mo-based RMICs that are used to form the article <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are based on molybdenum suicides, such as, but not limited to, MoSi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Mo<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>Si, Mo<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and Mo<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>SiB<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and comprise molybdenum, silicon, and at least one of boron or chromium. The Mo-based RMICs each preferably comprise between about 2.5 and about 13.5 atomic percent silicon, between about 3.5 and about 26.5 atomic percent boron, and a balance of molybdenum. Alternatively, the Mo-based RMICs may comprise between about 13 and about 16 atomic percent silicon, between about 25 and about 40 atomic percent chromium, and a balance of molybdenum. The Mo-based RMICs may also include other elements, such as, but not limited to, tantalum, titanium, zirconium, rhenium, carbon, hafnium, germanium, tungsten, vanadium, tin, and aluminum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The joints formed by braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at interface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in article <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> must sustain thermal, axial/centrifugal, and pressure differential stresses. In an airfoil, for example, the gas path side of the article (formed by second piece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) may experience temperatures of about 1315&deg; C., whereas the cold side (formed by first piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) may only reach about 1000&deg; C. Both steady-state and transient (occurring during aircraft takeoffs and landings) thermal stresses act upon the bonding surfaces in a shear mode. The pressure differential between the gas path side and the cold side can be as high as about 0.1 ksi, and it will exert ballooning, or tensile, stresses on the bonding surfaces at interface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In addition, the airfoils also produce centrifugal stresses during rotation that act upon the bonding surface in a shear mode. The combined stresses acting on the bonding surfaces can be very significant at the potentially high operating temperatures of a turbine assembly. The joints formed by braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at interface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> must be able to withstand such stresses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The interaction between braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, first piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and second piece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> must also be considered. The braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> must not significantly degrade the properties of the Nb- and/or Mo-based RMICs that form first piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and second piece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>; it is preferable that braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> consume as little of first piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and/or second piece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as is practical. Moreover, braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> must have sufficient oxidation and environmental resistance to avoid internal oxidation during the brazing and subsequent homogenization processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Temperature regimes for the bonding operations also impose constraints on the selection of braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for joining first piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and second piece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Preferably, braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be used for joining first piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and second piece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at temperatures below about 1450&deg; C., as bonding of first piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and second piece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at temperatures higher than about 1450&deg; C. requires expensive tooling and fixtures that may not be able to produce an article <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that has the required precision in dimensions. In addition, internal oxidation becomes a severe threat to forming good bonds at higher temperatures. On the other hand, when the braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has a melting temperature below the potential operating temperatures (e.g., about 1000&deg; C.) of article <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, care must be taken to ensure that low eutectic compositions of braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with either first piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or second piece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> do not exist after homogenization of the interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Interdiffusion of elements from the braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into first piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and second piece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> enhances joining of first piece <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and second piece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Thus, the solubility of the elements of braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the Nb-based and/or Mo-based RIMCs must also be taken into account. After brazing and homogenization, the bonded and diffused regions of article <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably have melting temperatures of up to about 1450&deg; C. In service, joints formed by braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at interface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in article <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are exposed to temperatures that are close to the bulk temperature of article <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or up to about 1200&deg; C., rather than the temperature of up to about 1315&deg; C. that is experienced by the surface (formed by second piece <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) of article <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The approximate temperature regimes of the brazing and homogenization operations relative to the melting temperatures and the potential working temperatures of Nb- and Mo-based RIMCs are summarized in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A number of braze systems are primarily based on eutectic or congruent melting systems; the composition of such brazes are therefore restricted by available eutectic compositions and temperatures. Some such eutectic or eutectic-like compositions may not have enough strength, ductility, and/or oxidation-resistance to serve as successful brazes for Nb- and Mo-based RMICs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention employs a braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprising a physical mixture of at least two components having different melting temperatures. At the brazing temperature, one component melts while the remaining component(s) remains solid, thus creating a semi-solid braze. The solid component of such a semi-solid braze may comprise a component that will provide strength and toughness to the bonded area. At the brazing temperature, the liquid phase can vary from about 20 to about 80 volume percent, and, preferably, between about 30 and about 50 volume percent of braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. By way of example, the liquid component of braze <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be based on the Ti&mdash;Si eutectic at about 13.5 atomic percent Si, having a melting temperature of about 1330&deg; C. The solid component may be, but is not limited to, a niobium-silicon composition containing 18.7 atomic percent silicon (i.e., Nb-18.7 at. % Si); or a niobium-hafnium-silicon composition containing 16 atomic percent hafnium and 18.7 atomic percent silicon (i.e., Nb-16 at. % Hf-24 at. % Si); or the like. Such a semi-solid braze would allow brazing to take place at about 1400&deg; C. In another example, a semi-solid braze comprising about 10 volume percent of a V&mdash;Zr eutectic composition, containing about 57 atomic percent Zr and having a melting temperature of about 1265&deg; C., 20 volume percent of a Cr&mdash;Ti eutectic composition, containing about 55 atomic percent Ti and having a melting temperature of about 1410&deg; C., and 70 volume percent of a Hf&mdash;W&mdash;Nb alloy may be used to achieve an improved balance of oxidation resistance and mechanical properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In addition to achieving the desired balance between oxidation resistance and mechanical properties and allowing the use of braze compositions that deviate from the eutectic compositions, the semi-solid brazes of the present invention also overcome the solubility limitations of conventional braze compositions and the time required for diffusion bonding. A considerable amount of time is usually required for a molten braze to diffuse into the first and second pieces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> formed from Nb- and/or Mo-based RMICs. In addition, in order for first and second pieces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to accommodate the components of the molten braze, a significant amount of the Nb- and/or Mo-based RMICs is consumed, and the braze region near interface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will mostly comprise a metal phase and thus possess limited strength, but good toughness, after diffusion bonding. By using a semi-solid braze of the present invention, the brazing operation can be performed in significantly less time and at a lower temperature than with a conventional eutectic braze composition. Moreover, the diffusion bonded region formed using the semi-solid braze of the present invention will have properties that more closely approach those of the parent Nb- and/or Mo-based RMIC first and second pieces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that are being joined. </paragraph>
