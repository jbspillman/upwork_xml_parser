<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to the chemistry of biologically active compounds, namely, to a new method to prepare water-soluble porphyrin derivatives, particularly chlorin derivatives. The compounds of the present invention can be used as photosensitizers for the photodynamic therapy of cancer, infections and other diseases as well as for light irradiation treatments in other cases. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is one of the most promising new techniques now being explored for use in a variety of medical applications (Photodynamic therapy, basic principles and clinical applications. Eds. B. W. Henderson, Th. .J. Dougherty, Marcel Dekker, 1992, New York), and particularly is a well-recognized treatment for the destruction of tumors (Photodynamic tumor therapy. 2<highlight><superscript>nd </superscript></highlight>and 3<highlight><superscript>rd </superscript></highlight>generation photosensitizers. Ed. J. G. Moser, Harwood Academic Publishers, 1998, Amsterdam). Porphyrins are compounds widely used in PDT. The problem in pharmaceutical application of porphyrins is their low solubility in physiological solutions, rejecting the possibility to prepare injectable solutions for the PDT and for some other applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Methods to prepare water soluble porphyrin derivatives for PDT are known in the art. There is a method to prepare trisodium lysyl-chlorin p<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>involving the interaction between purpurin 18 methyl ester, resulting from methyl pheophorbide &agr; transformation, and aqueous lysine in methylene chloride in the presence of pyridine. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 12 hours, followed by the removal of the solvents in a high vacuum. The so prepared crude product is purified by the reversed-phase BPLC and subsequently lyophilized. To prepare an injectable solution for the PDT of cancer the preparation is dissolved in phosphate buffer solution, 0.1 N sodium hydroxide is added, the pH value of the solution being adjusted to pH 7.35 using 0.1 N HCl, followed by the sterility filtration through a microporous filter &lsqb;Smith K. M., Lee S.-J. Long-wavelength, Water Soluble Chlorin Photosensitizers Useful for Photodynamic Therapy and Diagnosis of Tumors. U.S. Cl. 424/9. U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,741, 07/1994&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The drawbacks of the above mentioned method include bad reproducibility, hard work-up and utilization of toxic reagents. These limitations make this method inappropriate for pharmaceutical manufacturing. In addition, the prepared water soluble product of interest is stable in an aqueous solution for only 24 hours at 4&deg; C. in the dark, and in solid form for up to 4 months at 4&deg; C. in the dark &lsqb;M. W. Leach, R. J. Higgins, J. E. Boggan, S.-J. Lee, S. Autry, K. M. Smith, Effectiveness of a Lysylchlorin p<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>/Chlorin p<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>mixture in Photodynamic Therapy of the Subcutaneous 9L Glioma in the Rat. <highlight><italic>Cancer Res., </italic></highlight>1992, 52, 1235-1239; K. M. Smith, S.-J. Lee, Long-wavelength Water Soluble Chlorin Photosensitizers Useful for Photodynamic Therapy and Diagnosis of Tumors. U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,741&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another method is to prepare a water-soluble sodium pheophorbide &agr;. According to the cited invention, pheophorbide a (2) is dissolved in diethyl ether, and a very diluted solution of alkali in n-propanol, iso-propanol or in their mixture is added dropwise and very slowly to the solution. The reaction is being undergone up to the complete precipitation of pheophorbide a salt, being separated by centrifugation and dried in vacuo. Then the product is dissolved in water resulting in a solution with concentration 0.5% and pH 9.2-9.5, that is then diluted with phosphate buffer with pH 7.4-7.8 &lsqb;M. Nakazato, Method of Producing Water-soluble Sodium Pheophorbide a. U.S. Cl.540/145. U.S. Pat. No. 5,378, 835, 01/1995&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The drawback of the referred method is the fact that a concentrated (&gt;1%) injectable pheophorbide a solution in water can not be generated by this technique. Additionally, the authors of the present invention demonstrated chemical instability of such salts when stored dryly, and their incomplete ability to dissolve in water after having been stored in the dry state.

Shvetz, R. F. Baum, V. V.

<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Key disadvantages of this method which cause critical difficulties for preparative syntheses of water-soluble chlorins and particularly for industrial syntheses and drug manufacturing are the following: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> 1. Chlorin e<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>as intermediate product is obtained as wet mass with unknown definite content of chlorin that brings uncertainties for standardization of its further solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> 2. A key intermediate in the synthetic sequence is pheophorbide a (2) which is difficult to handle for purification and standardization due to its acidic properties. Separation of (2) via repeatable precipitations (as used in the prototype) is not quantitative and thus not convenient for large scale preparations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> 3. Pheophorbide a (2) obtained by the indicated method contains impurities that are difficult to separate. This disadvantage causes uncertainty in quantification of (2) and disturb the chemical opening of cyclopentanone ring in the course of transformation of (2) into chlorins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> 4. The samples of water soluble salts of chlorin e<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>being prepared according to the closest prior art to the present invention, namely the method of G. V. Ponomarev, A. V. Reshetnikov, T. N. Guseva-Donskaja, V. I. Shvetz, R. F. Baum, V. V. Ashmarov, Method to prepare water-soluble chlorines, RU 2144538 Cl, priority date 22.01.1998, contain a variety of impurities of non-porphyrin and porphyrin types which could not be separated from the target chlorin e<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>product with the use of the procedures described in the prior art. Particularly, among the porphyrin impurities one could find, by using TLC and BHLC methods, the pheophorbide a (2), purpurin 18 (6) and chiorin p6 (7) and some other contaminants.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It should also be noted that the compounds of types (2), (6) and (7) as salts with hydrophilic amines of present inventions are characterized by remarkably lower water solubility as compared with respective chlorin e<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>salts. Nevertheless, in the presence of chlorin e<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>salts the compounds of types (2), (6) and (7) as salts with hydrophilic amines of present inventions are more water soluble than in isolation, which could be explained by the possible formation of complexes with chlorin e<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>salts. This phenomenon makes it impossible to separate the chiorin e<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>products from the impurities like the compounds of types (2), (6) and (7) by using the differences in their water solubilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> 5. The organic amines being used in the prototype invention for preparation of water-soluble chlorins are not optimal for practical applications. In particular, D-glucosamine, which forms complexes with chlorin having a higher water solubility, is not stable enough due to the possible oxidation at its aldehyde group. Furthermore, D-glucosamine can be present in the solution in several isomeric forms which creates structural uncertainties and corresponding difficulties for detailed structural characterization, thus failing to meet the demands of quality control for pharmaceutical preparations. One other spacious amine has been used in the prior art, namely, N-methyl-D-glucosamine which has the same disadvantages as the above mentioned D-glucosamine and, moreover, is hardly available due to its difficult preparation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> 6. The prototype invention claims the formation of water-soluble salts of chlorine e<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>derivatives with spatial organic amines which is very uncertain because usual spatial organic amines, e.g. those ones containing tert-butyl, neopentyl, adamantyl, cyclohexyl groups, could not be used in the preparation of water-soluble chlorin e<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>salts due to due to high hydrophobicity of spatial organic moieties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> These circumstances make the use of the prototype procedure in the prior art impossible for drug manufacturing according to GMP standards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Starting porphyrin derivatives for the syntheses of interest are traditionally obtained from pure and standard raw porphyrin materials methyl (3) or ethyl (4) pheophorbide a General methods known to date for the separation of porphyrins from biological raw materials consist of a long sequence of laborious washings with organic solvents and/or freezing steps to destroy cell walls of the biomaterial, and repeatable extractions together with chemical treatments of the biomass to obtain chlorophyll first, which then is transformed into pheophytin and subsequently hydrolyzed to yield pheophorbide (K. M. Smith, D. A. Goff and D. J. Simpson, <highlight><italic>J Amer. Chem. Soc</italic></highlight>., 1985, 107, 4946-4954; R. K. Pandey, D. A. Bellnier, K. M. Smith and T. J. Dougherty, <highlight><italic>Photochem. Photobiol</italic></highlight>., 1991, 53, 65-72; W. A. Svec, In: The porphyrins, ed. D. Dolphyn, NY, Academic Press, 1978, 5, 342-400; 0.1. Koifinan, K. A.

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> There is an obvious need to provide an easy and efficient method for the preparation of pure and chemically stable water-soluble porphyrin derivatives with standard content of the main substance, suitable for medical applications especially in photodynamic therapy.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Prior to setting forth the invention it may be helpful to set forth definitions of certain terms to be used within the disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Porphyrins are macrocycle compounds with bridges of one carbon atom or one nitrogen atom respectively, joining the pyrroles to form the characteristic tetrapyrrole ring structure. There are many different classes of porphyrin derivatives including that ones containing dihydro-pyrrole units. The term porphyrins will be used herein to refer to porphyrins, phthalocyanines, chlorins, metallo derivatives thereof and other porphyrin-like compounds suitable for PDT and pharmaceutical preparations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As used herein, biological raw materials are materials for preparation of compounds of the present invention, comprising e.g. plants, algae, blood components, insect excretions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The aim of the invention is achieved by the proposed method, comprising the interaction of acidic porphyrins in water or aqueous organic solution with a hydrophilic organic amine preferably with N-methyl-D-glucamine (8) which is a polyhydroxylated stable and non-toxic compound useful for drug preparation or with amino alkyl and amino aryl glycosides, for example maltose derivatives (9) and (10), or other amino-group containing carbohydrate derivatives. Other proposed reagents are e.g. TRIS (11) which is also a stable and non-toxic compound useful for drug preparation, or with TRIS derivatives, for example compounds (12) and (13), as well as other types of hydrophilic amines, for example bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amine (14). Aminoacids or oligopeptides for example oligolysines, preferentially penta- and hexa-lysines also can be used as hydrophilic organic amines suitable for preparation of water-soluble porphyrin derivatives of the present invention.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to the first preferred embodiment of the present invention, as described in Example 9, the quantitative stoichiometric interaction of chemically pure porphyrin (as free acid) and an appropriate hydrophilic organic amine is performed at room temperature under inert gas and in darkness. The solvent used is either chemically pure water which is degassed with an inert gas (e.g. argon, helium or others), or, if necessary, a mixture of water with a suitable chemically pure and degassed organic solvent. The organic solvent is subsequently evaporated in vacuo without heating (to avoid possible destruction of starting porphyrin), and the product is freeze-dried. In some cases it is necessary to add an organic solvent to assist the reaction by dissolving the starting porphyrin so that the interaction of the porphyrin (as free acid) and appropriate hydrophilic organic amine takes place. Examples for possible organic solvents are acetone or a mixture of methylene chloride and methanol. The resulting freeze-dried water-soluble porphyrin is chemically pure and does not need any further purification except sterilization for medical or biological applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred embodiment of the present invention, impure ingredients can be used including wet pastes of starting porphyrins. The reaction is performed similarly as described above, but an excess amount of hydrophilic organic amine is used to involve all porphyrin components in the reaction. After the concentration of reaction mixture in vacuo the resulting water-soluble porphyrin is purified by the chromatography on the column with appropriate reversed phase adsorbent, preferentially of RP C-8 or C-18 types. Fractions with target products are collected, evaporated in vacuo without heating to remove organic solvent, and freeze-dried to give the desired water-soluble porphyrin derivative. Developed protocols for purification of water-soluble porphyrin derivatives by reversed phase chromatography with the use of volatile solvents yield the high quality which is critical in the manufacture of medical preparations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment the present invention is an easy and efficient method of obtaining of porphyrin compounds from biological raw materials. The method comprises undergoing a direct acidic alcoholysis, which might be done in a one or two steps, of biological raw materials, preferably methanolysis or ethanolysis, giving crystalline alkyl pheophorbides (preferably methyl and ethyl) as key intermediate products suitable for a variety of further chemical transformations to obtain the target porphyrin derivatives. This simple and efficient procedure permits the preparation of porphyrin derivatives from biological raw materials without the use of laborious washings with organic solvents or freezing (to destroy cell walls) of the starting biomaterials and repeatable extractions as necessary in the known procedures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Application of crystalline alkyl pheophorbides (preferably methyl and ethyl) as synthetic intermediate products allows for simple purification and standardization that is critical for manufacturing medical preparations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Performance of alcoholysis depends on the quality of starting biological raw material and particularly on its dryness which is important for maintaining the necessary acid concentration during alcoholysis. Thus, in the case of sufficiently dry material, e.g. dried <highlight><italic>Spirulina or Chlorella </italic></highlight>biomasses or powdered dry nettle leaves (see Examples 1-5) it is possible to perform direct one step preparation of alkyl pheophorbides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the case of insufficiently dry raw material, the preparation of alkyl pheophorbides is performed by a two step alcoholysis as exemplified by the preparation of methyl pheophorbides a (3) and b (15) from spinach (see Example 6). In such cases the presence of excessive amounts of water in the starting raw material does not permit reaching the appropriate concentration of acid suitable to perform the cleavage of the phytol ester. Nevertheless, pheophytins, being obtained after the first alcoholysis step, are dry enough to be used in the preparation of crystalline alkyl pheophorbides within the second alcoholysis step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Preparation of acidic porphyrins suitable for further transformation into water-soluble forms is performed by chemical transformation of porphyrin raw materials. For example, crystalline alkyl pheophorbides obtained from biological raw materials according to the procedure described in the present invention.

Fischer, H. Orth, Die Chemie des Pyrrols. Leipzig: Akademische Verlag, 1937, V. II, part I, p. 423; C. Rimington, A. Roennestad, A. Western, and J.

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In a similar manner the interaction of other types of nucleophiles with 2-devinyl-2-(l-bromoethyl)-pheophorbides instead of their alcoholysis affords the formation of a variety of possible porphyrin derivatives to be used in the preparation of their water-soluble forms according to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The interaction of chlorins with hydrophilic amines according to the present invention leads to the formation of mainly of bis-salts, because the carboxyl group at position 6 (atom numbering is shown for compounds 2-4) does not exhibit sufficient acidity for salt formation. Due to the reversible character of the reaction of bis-salt formation (Scheme 1) it is desirable to perform it in the presence of the excess of hydrophilic amine.

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Water-soluble chlorin bis-salts of present invention can be obtained in the individual state by column chromatography purification as exemplified in Example 9B. Dissolving of purified bis-salts in water leads to reversible hydrolysis to give mono-salts (e.g. of type 19, see Scheme 2) which may have reduced water solubility compared to bis-salts and, probably, the parent chlorin (1) which is poorly soluble in water. Such processes can result in the formation of small precipitate during the storage of solutions.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> To prevent such undesirable processes and maintaining clear and homogeneous solutions, which is strictly necessary for their usage in medical applications, e.g. in the field of PDT, it is preferential to dissolve bis-salts in water in the presence of small and known amount of the respective hydrophilic amine (e.g. lower than 2 mole equivalents, more preferably between 0.1 and 0.5 equivalents), so that the desired porphyrin derivatives are kept in the form of bis-salts and thus the formation of mono-salts and parent chlorins by hydrolysis of bis-salts is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to use the chemically stable and water-soluble porphyrin derivatives according to formula (1) for various medical applications. Said compounds are especially preferable for the use in PDT to treat cancer, other hyperproliferative diseases, infections and other diseases. Due to the water-solubility said compounds are prepared in various pharmaceutically acceptable and active preparations for different administration methods, e.g. injections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Determination of dark toxicity (example 14, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) and photo toxicity (example 15, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) of one of the porphyrin derivatives of the present invention, namely the water-soluble salt of chlorin e<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>(5) with N-methyl-D-glucamine (8) being prepared according to Example 9 in cell culture experiments showed excellent properties of the compounds for the use in PDT. The experiments were carried out to also demonstrate the inferior characteristics (higher dark toxicity and lower photo toxicity) of a same compound but being prepared according to prototype technology (RU2144538). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> However, in special cases the administration of defined mixtures of hydrophilic amine salts of different porphyrin derivatives might be advantageous, if these mixtures display a higher photo toxicity towards the diseased tissue. This enhanced photo toxicity might be caused by the observed phenomenon of the enhancement of water solubility of the mixture of compounds (2), (5) and (6) as salts with hydrophilic amines in the presence of the same salts of chiorin e<highlight><subscript>6. </subscript></highlight></paragraph>
