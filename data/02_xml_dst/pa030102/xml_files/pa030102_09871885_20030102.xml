<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is related to the field of electrochemical sensors, particularly enzyme-electrode sensors, and to the regeneration or maintenance of the functional properties of the membranes of such sensors. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a variety of clinical situations it is important to measure certain chemical characteristics of the patient&apos;s blood such as pH, hematocrit, the ion concentration of calcium, potassium, chloride, sodium, glucose, lactate, creatinine, creatine, urea, the partial pressure of O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and the like. These situations range from a routine visit of a patient in a physician&apos;s office to monitoring of a patient during open-heart surgery. The required speed, accuracy, and other performance characteristics vary with each situation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Typically, electrochemical sensor systems which provide blood chemistry analysis are stand-alone machines or are adapted to be connected to an extracorporeal shunt or an ex vivo blood source such as a heart/lung machine used to sustain a patient during surgery. Thus, for example, small test samples of ex vivo blood can be diverted off-line from either the venous or arterial flow lines of a heart/lung machine directly to a chamber exposed to a bank of micro-electrodes which generate electrical signals proportional to chemical characteristics of the real time flowing blood sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Electrochemical sensor systems are analytical tools combining a chemical or biochemical recognition component (e.g., an enzyme) with a physical transducer such as a platinum electrode. The chemical or biochemical recognition component is capable of selectively interacting with an znalyte of interest and of generating, directly or indirectly, an electrical signal through the transducer. Electrochemical sensor systems play an increasing role in solving analytical and clinical problems, and find applications in the field of medical diagnostics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The selectivity of certain biochemical recognition components makes it possible to develop electrochemical sensors which can accurately detect certain biological analytes even in a complex analyte mixture such as whole blood. Despite the high degree of selectivity of certain biochemical recognition components, the selectivity of such sensors as a whole may nonetheless be compromised by the presence of certain biological interferents (e.g. ascorbic acid, uric acid, acetaminophen, cysteine, etc.) which can directly interact with the physical transducer if they are not prevented from doing so. Accuracy and precision of electrochemical sensor systems with biochemical recognition compounds is also compromised by residual levels of analyte remaining in the sensor from a prior sample affecting the analysis of the following sample. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides electrodes and electrochemical sensor systems for measuring characteristics of aqueous samples including, but not limited to, blood, serum or other body fluids. Specifically, the invention is directed to such sensors in which the electrodes include an interference rejection membrane, which is the inner polymeric membrane of the composite membrane and is renewable in situ. The electrochemical sensor systems according to the invention have increased accuracy and precision and increased effective life spans. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the sensor system is adapted to measure the concentration or activity of blood gases (e.g., oxygen and carbon dioxide) ions (e.g., sodium, chloride, potassium and calcium), glucose, lactate, creatine, creatinine, blood pH and hematocrit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Definitions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In order to more clearly and concisely point out and describe the subject matter which applicant regards as the invention, the following definitions are provided for certain terms used in the following description and claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;electrode&rdquo; refers to a component of an electrochemical device which makes the interface between the external electrical conductor and the internal ionic medium. The internal ionic medium, typically, is an aqueous solution with dissolved salts. The medium may also comprise proteins in a stabilizing matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Electrodes are of three types, working or indicator electrodes, reference electrodes, and counter electrodes. A working or indicator electrode measures a specific chemical species, such as an ion. When electrical potentials are measured by a working electrode, the method is termed potentiometry. All ion-selective electrodes operate by potentiometry. When current is measured by a working electrode, the method is termed amperometry. Oxygen measurement is carried out by amperometry. Working electrodes may also function by including an enzyme as part of an enzyme layer that is part of a composite layer that is in close contact with the electrode. The enzyme, which is specific to a particular analyte, produces hydrogen peroxide, a by-product of the catalytic reaction of the enzyme on the analyte. Hydrogen peroxide is detected by the electrode and converted to an electrical signal. A reference electrode serves as an electrical reference point in an electrochemical device against which electrical potentials are measured and controlled. In one embodiment, silver-silver nitrate forms the reference electrodes. Other types of reference electrodes are mercury-mercurous chloride-potassium chloride or silver-silver chloride-potassium chloride. A counter electrode acts as a sink for the current path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;sensor&rdquo; is a device that responds to variations in the concentration of a given chemical species, such as glucose or lactate, in a sample, such as a body fluid sample. An electrochemical sensor is a sensor that operates based on an electrochemical principle and requires at least two electrodes. For ion-selective measurements, the two electrodes include an ion-selective electrode and a reference electrode. Amperometric enzyme electrodes additionally require a third electrode, a counter electrode. Moreover, enzyme sensors based on two electrodes, a working and reference electrode, are also common. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;ion selective electrode&rdquo; generally refers to a silver wire coated with silver chloride in contact with a buffer solution containing a chloride concentration (the inner solution). The buffer solution is covered with a polymeric ion-selective membrane that is in contact with the test solution. The ion selective membrane typically consists of a high molecular weight PVC, a plasticizer, an ionophore specific to a particular ion, and a borate salt. The surface of the polymeric membrane is in contact with the test sample on one side and the inner buffer solution on the other side of the membrane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;dry electrochemical sensor&rdquo; refers to the ion selective electrode, described above, and a reference electrode, described above. In the &ldquo;dry chemical&rdquo; embodiment, the ion-selective electrodes have the same configuration as described above, however, the inner solution containing chloride, is dried, i.e., dehydrated leaving a layer of dry salt. In order to function as an electrochemical sensor, the dried salt must be solubilized in water to obtain a buffer solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;enzyme electrode&rdquo; generally refers to a composite membrane deposited on a metal electrode, comprising platinum for example. The composite membrane is at least three distinct layers including an outer polymeric membrane on the side of the composite membrane in contact with the sample that forms a protective layer, a middle enzyme layer that is located between the outer and inner layers, and an inner polymeric membrane closest to the metal electrode that forms the inner interference rejection membrane. The outer polymeric membrane, which is comprised of one or more polymeric compounds, generally functions to protect and maintain the structure of the middle enzyme layer and to control the diffusion of the analyte into the middle enzyme layer. The middle or enzyme layer comprises at least one protein species with enzymatic activity. The enzymatic activity may also be provided by compounds which include DNA, RNA, and carbohydrate, for example. The enzyme is stabilized in a matrix conducive to the activity of the enzyme. The inner or interference rejection membrane is a polymeric membrane that functions to insulate the wire electrode from compounds in the sample that interfere with the functioning and accuracy of the electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;hydration&rdquo; refers to the process of solubilizing the salts of a sensor&apos;s inner salt layer by the passage of water through the ion-selective outer polymeric membrane bounding one side of the inner salt layer, into the inner salt layer to form a solution. Hydration normally can be achieved by mere contact of the outside of the polymeric membrane and inner salt solution with an aqueous salt solution for a required duration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> As used herein, &ldquo;thermal cycling&rdquo; is the process by which the temperature of an electrochemical sensor, soaked in an aqueous salt solution, is raised to a specified elevated temperature for a specified length of time, and then lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;calibration&rdquo; refers to the process by which the response characteristics of a sensor to a specific analyte are determined quantitatively. To calibrate a sensor, the sensor is exposed to at least two reagent samples, each reagent sample having a different, known concentration of an analyte. The responses, i.e., signals, measured by the sensor, relative to the concentrations of the analyte in the two different reagent samples, serve as reference points for measurements of the analyte in samples having unknown concentrations of the analyte. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the electrochemical sensor system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> employs a sensor assembly, generally indicated at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, incorporating a plurality of electrodes adapted to make electrical measurements on a sample, such as a blood sample, introduced to the sensor assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Blood samples to be analyzed by the system are introduced through a sample inlet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Blood samples are obtained by, for example, phlebotomy or are derived on a periodic basis from an extracorporeal blood flow circuit connected to a patient during, for example, open heart surgery. Blood samples may be introduced into the sample inlet <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through other automatic means, or manually, as by syringe. The blood samples may be introduced as discrete samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The electrochemical system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> including a number of essential components as heretofore described in a preferred embodiment of the present invention is contained in a disposable cartridge <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. A cartridge of a similar type is set forth in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 4,734,184, the entirety of the specification incorporated by reference herein. In one embodiment of the invention, the electrochemical sensor system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> incorporates in the cartridge <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> at least two prepackaged containers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, each containing a calibrating aqueous solution having known values of the parameters to be measured by the system. For purposes of reference, the solution contained within the prepackaged container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will be termed Calibrating Solution A, the solution contained within the prepackaged container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will be termed Calibrating Solution B. In another embodiment of the invention, the electrochemical system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, includes a third prepackaged container <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> containing Calibrating Solution AO. Each of the prepackaged containers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> contain a sufficient quantity of its calibrating solution to allow the system to be calibrated a substantial number of times before the prepackaged container becomes empty. When one or more of the containers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> containing the calibrating solutions are empty, the cartridge containing prepackaged containers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> must be replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In a particular embodiment of the invention, the Calibrating Solution AO contains electropolymerizable monome. Electropolymerizable monomer such as m-phenylenediamine may be included in the calibrating solutions at a concentration in a range of about 1 to 100 mM, preferably about 15 mM. In another embodiment of the invention, a solution of electropolymerizable monomer, is contained in a prepackaged container (not shown) separate from the prepackaged containers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for the calibrated solutions at a concentration in a range of about 1 to 100 mM, preferably about 15 mM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in one embodiment the prepackaged container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to the input of a multi-position valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through a flow line <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the prepackaged container <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connected to a second input of the multi-position valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through a flow line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In yet another embodiment, the container <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is connected to a third input of the multi-position valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through a flow line <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Another container <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> contains a rinse solution and is connected to the input of the multi-position valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through a flow line <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In yet another embodiment, the rinse bag <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is eliminated and one of the calibration solutions A or B is used as a rinse solution, as well. The output line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is the output of the multi-position valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and is connected to the sample input line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through a stylus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Depending upon the position of the valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the input lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> or air is open to the valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Similarly, when the stylus is in a normal position (position <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) of the sample input line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is open to the sample input line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and allows passage of the calibrating, or rinse solution, or air through the sample input line <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to the sensor assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, facilitated by the operation of a peristaltic pump schematically illustrated at <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. However, in a sample accepting mode (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), line <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is separated from the sample input line (position <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and the sample is introduced directly to the sensor assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, facilitated by the operation of the peristaltic pump <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The cartridge <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> also includes a container <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, for a reference solution. The container <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is connected to the sensor assembly by a flow line <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The system further includes a container <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for waste, which receives the blood samples, the calibrating solutions and the reference solution after they have passed through the sensor assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, via a flexible conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that has input from the sensor assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Both the waste flow conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the reference solution flow line <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> consist of or include sections of flexible walled tubing that pass through the peristaltic pump <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The pump <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> compresses and strokes the flexible sections of the flow lines <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to induce a pressured flow of reference solution from the container <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to the electrode assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and to create a negative pressure on the waste products in flow line <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> so as to draw fluids, including the fluids with the polymerizable monomers, in the flow line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through passages in the electrode assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> past the membranes of the sensors. This arrangement, as opposed to the alternative of inducing positive pressure on the blood and calibrating solutions to force them through the electrode assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, avoids the imposition of unnecessary and possibly traumatic mechanical forces on the blood sample and minimizes possibilities of leaks in the electrode assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Cartridge <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> also contains a sensor card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which provides a low volume, gas tight chamber in which the sample, such as a blood sample, calibration solution, or monomer-containing solution, is presented to one or more electrochemical sensors, i.e., the pH, pCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, pO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, Ca<highlight><superscript>&plus;&plus;</superscript></highlight>, glucose, lactate, creatine, creatinine and hematocrit sensors, together with the reference electrode collectively indicated as sensors <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, are integral parts of the chamber. Chemically sensitive, hydrophobic membranes typically formed from polymers, such as polyvinyl chloride, specific ionophores, and a suitable plasticizer, are permanently bonded to the chamber body. These chemically sensitive, hydrophobic membranes, described below in detail, are the interface between the sample or calibrating solutions and the buffer solution in contact with the inner (silver/silver chloride) electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, referring still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, included in the cartridge <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, are three solutions that allow for calibrations at high and low concentrations for all parameters except hematocrit, which calibrates at one level. In one embodiment, the cartridge <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> also includes the rotor-for-sample inlet arm <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the pump tubing <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the sampling stylus <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a waste bag <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the reference solution container <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the rinse solution container <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, calibration solution containers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the check valve <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and tubes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Blood samples that have been analyzed are prevented from flowing back into the sensor card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> from the waste container <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> due to the presence of a one-way check <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> valve in the waste line <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. After use in the system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, the cartridge <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is intended to be discarded and replaced by another cartridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, sensors are available as a bank of electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> fabricated in a plastic card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and housed in the disposable cartridge <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> that interfaces with a thermal block assembly <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of a suitably adapted blood chemistry analysis machine. The thermal block assembly <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> houses the heating/cooling devices such as a resistive element or a Peltier-effect device, a thermistor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to monitor and control the temperature, the electrical interface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> between the sensors in the plastic card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through the analog board <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The analog board <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> houses analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters. The signal from the electrode interface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> passes through the analog-to-digital converter, converted into digital form for the processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to store and display. Conversely, the digital signals from the processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, for example, the polarization voltage for oxygen sensor, go through the digital-to-analog converter, converted into an analog form and fed to the sensors for control, through the electrode interface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The electrochemical sensor system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is formed upon insertion of the cartridge <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> into the electrochemical sensor apparatus. Upon insertion, the sensor card <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> fits into the heater block assembly <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, described in detail below, and the heating/cooling assembly regulated by the microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> cycles the temperature of the sensor card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the solution in contact with the sensors inside the sensor card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through a specific temperature for a specified duration. The heater block assembly <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is capable of rapid heating and cooling by, for example, a thermoelectric device applying, for example, the Peltier-effect, monitored by a thermistor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, all controlled by the microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The sensors connect to the electrode interface <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which select one of the plurality of electrical signals generated by the sensors and passes the electrical signal to the microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the machine through an analog-to-digital converter into the analog board <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> where it is converted from analog to digital form, suitable for storage and display. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the electrode assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a number of edge connectors <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in a bank which allow it to be plugged into a female matching connector <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> so that the electrodes formed on the assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be connected to microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through the analog board <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is connected to the multiport valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> via a valve driver <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> by a line <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and to the motor of the peristaltic pump <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> via a pump driver <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> by a line <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> controls the position of the sample arm <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> through arm driver <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and the position of the valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the energization of the pump <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to cause sequences of blood samples and calibrating solutions to be passed through the electrode assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When the calibrating solutions from, for example, containers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are pumped into the electrode assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the electrodes forming part of the assembly make measurements of the parameters of the sample and the microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> stores these electrical values. Based upon measurements made during the passage of the calibration solutions through the electrode assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the known values of the measured parameters contained within the calibrating solution from containers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> effectively creates a calibration curve for each of the measured parameters so that when a blood sample is passed through the electrode assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> the measurements made by the electrodes can be used to derive accurate measurements of the parameters of interest. These parameters are stored and displayed by the microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is suitably programmed to perform measurement, calculation, storage, and control functions such as differences in electrical potential across one or more electrodes. Calibrating Solutions In one embodiment of the invention a composition of calibrating solution A used for second point calibration, prepared at 37&deg; C. and at atmospheric pressure tonometered with 9% CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>14% O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and 77% Helium gas, is as follows: pH <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> organic buffer; pCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;63 mmHg; pO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;100 mmHg; Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>&equals;100 mmol/L; K<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>&equals;7 mmol/L; Ca<highlight><superscript>&plus;&plus;</superscript></highlight>&equals;2.5 mmol/L; glucose&equals;150 mg/dL; lactate&equals;4 mmol/L; creatine&equals;0.5 mmol/L; creatinine&equals;<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> mmol/L; surfactant and inert preservative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention a composition of calibration solution B used for one-point calibration and rinse, prepared at 37&deg; C. and at 700 mmHg absolute pressure tonometered with 27% O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, 5% CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and 68% Helium gas, is as follows: pH 7.40 organic buffer; pCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;34 mmHg; pO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&equals;180 mmHg; Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>&equals;140 mmol/L; K<highlight><superscript>&plus;&equals;</superscript></highlight>3.5 mmol/L; Ca<highlight><superscript>&plus;&plus;</superscript></highlight>&equals;1.0 mmol/L; surfactant and inert preservative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment of the invention a preferred composition of calibration solution AO for low level oxygen calibration and in situ regeneration of the inner polymeric membrane for the enzyme sensors contains aqueous solution of Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>, K&plus;, Ca<highlight><superscript>&plus;&plus;</superscript></highlight> salt; 15 mmol/L of m-phenylenediamine, 20 mmol/L of sulfite, surfactant and inert preservative; organic buffer, pCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The reference solution contains AgNO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&equals;1 mmol/L; KNO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&equals;1 mol/L; surfactant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The compositions of the A and B calibrating solutions are chosen so that for each of the characteristics measured by the system a pair of values are obtained that are spaced over the range of permissible values that are measured by the system, providing a balanced 2-point calibration for the instrument. The AO calibrating solution is chosen for low level oxygen calibration and regeneration of the inner polymeric membrane in the glucose, creatine, creatinine and lactate sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The A and B calibration compositions are prepared by premixing all of the constituents in a certain order starting with the buffer and ending with the sodium bicarbonate salt, then tonometering the solution with oxygen and CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>mixed with helium to produce the desired level of pCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and pO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. The AO calibration solution is prepared with a slight difference in procedure. The salts with the exception of sodium sulfite, m-phenylenediamine and sodium bicarbonate are added to water and the solution is tonometered with helium to bring the pO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>to less that 30 mmHg. Then, the remaining salts are added to the solution and the final mixture is tonometered with mixture of pCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and helium to produce the desired pCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> At least one electropolymerizable monomer is added to at least one of the calibrating solutions, solution AO in container <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for example. The absence of dissolved oxygen in the AO solution, due to presense of sulfite ion, allows for a longer shelf life of electropolymerizable monomer in the AO solution because dissolved oxygen will oxidize the electropolymerizable monomer and thus render the monomer incapable of polymerizing. The electropolymerizable monomers m-phenylenediamine for example, may be included in a calibrating solution at a concentration in a range between about 1 to 100 mM, preferably 15 mM. The electropolymerizable monomer may be included in the cartridge <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in a separate reservoir. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The temperature and pressure at which the calibrating solutions are prepared and their method of packaging must be such as to preclude the possibility of dissolved gases going out of solution in the container, which would affect the concentration of gases in the calibrating solutions, and to minimize the tendency for gases to permeate through even the most impermeable materials practically obtainable. The calibration solutions are packaged with the solutions completely filling the containers, so that there is no head space, by evacuating the containers prior to filling in a manner which will be subsequently described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> By filling the calibration solution into the evacuated flexible wall container <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at elevated temperatures and subatmospheric pressure, the solution will not have any tendency at a lower use temperature to outgas and thus produce gas bubbles in the container. Were outgassing to occur, the concentrations of the gases in the solution would be affected, creating an inaccuracy in the calibration of the instruments. Similarly, the calibration solutions must not be packaged at too low a pressure i.e., not below about 625 mm of mercury, because the absorptive capacity of the solution for gases conceivably increases as the packaging pressure decreases and below that pressure value the absorptive capacity of the solution may be sufficiently high that it will tend to draw gases in through the slight inherent permeability of even the most gas impervious flexible packaging material, over long periods of time. Accordingly, a packaging pressure in the range of 625-700 mm of mercury is preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a calibrating solution prepared at a temperature in excess of its intended use temperature so that at the lower temperature there is less tendency for outgassing of the dissolved gases. This cooperates with the reduced pressure packaging to minimize the possibility of outgassing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Calibration Solution A, B and AO are prepared at a temperature above its intended use temperature at a controlled pressure close to atmospheric pressure. Through use of elevated temperature (e.g., 37&deg; C.) the solution may be prepared at about atmospheric pressure without any possibility of subsequent microbubbles within the container or gas transfer through the container when packaged in a zero head space flexible gas impervious container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The envelopes which form the calibration solution prepackaged containers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are formed, for example, of rectangular sheets, heatsealed at the edges and heatsealed at one corner to an inlet stem of the valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is used for filling purposes. In the preferred embodiment illustrated, the prepackaged containers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the prepackaged container lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are formed in a unitary cluster with the valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so that gas phase dead space in the lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is thereby avoided. In a preferred procedure for purging and filling the envelope bags, the envelope is first evacuated and then filled with the prepared solution. The bag is then shaken while the excess solution continually flows out of the bag. This process removes any residual gas bubbles from the bag. The solution is then sealed in the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The calibration solutions in the prepackaged containers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> have excellent stability and a long shelf life. When at use temperature and atmospheric pressure there is no possibility of any outgassing from the liquid to form gas bubbles within the prepackaged containers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The reference solution disposed in prepackaged container <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is employed in the electrode assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as a supply source to a reference electrode to provide a liquid junction and thereby isolate the reference electrode from the varying electrochemical potential of the calibrating solution or the blood in a manner which will be subsequently described. In a preferred embodiment, the solution is 1 mol/L potassium nitrate and 1 mmol/L silver nitrate solution. The solution also contains a surfactant such as Brij 35. The solution is packaged in a sealed flexible container with no head space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Electrode Assembly </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, during operation of the pump <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the electrode assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives a constant pulsating flow of the reference solution via line <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and sequential, intermittent pulsating flows of either the blood sample or one of the calibrating solutions via line <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The assembly also provides a corresponding output of its waste products to a waste collection bag <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, by way of example, the electrode assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a preferred embodiment consists of a structurally rigid rectangular card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of polyvinylchloride having a rectangular aluminum (or other suitable material) cover plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> adhered to one of its surfaces. Cover plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> closes off the flow channels <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> formed in one surface of the card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and also acts as a heat transfer medium for hydrating the sensors by thermal cycling, described below, and to maintain the fluids flowing through the electrode assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the electrodes themselves, at a constant temperature during calibration and during measurement of relevant parameters in a patient sample. This may be achieved by measuring the temperature of the plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and employing a suitable heating or cooling element e.g., a Peltier-effect device and thermistor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to maintain the temperature of the plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at a desired temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> reference solution is introduced to a well <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, formed in the surface of the substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the same manner as the other flow channels <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and similarly covered by the metal plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The reference solution flow line <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> passes through an inclined hole in the well <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The well <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is connected to the output section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> through a very thin capillary section <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> formed in the surface of the plastic substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the same manner as the main flow channels <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The capillary channel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is substantially shallower and narrower than the main flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>; its cross section is approximately 0.5 sq. mm. Reference fluid pumped into the well <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> by the pump <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, via a line <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (see also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), fills the well, and is forced through the capillary section <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> where it joins the output stream of fluid passing through the main flow channel section <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and then flows with it to the waste bag <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The combined influence of its higher density described above and the capillarity of the flow channel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> serves to minimize any possibility of calibrating solution or blood passing downward through the channel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to the well <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and upsetting the electrochemical measurements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As a blood sample or calibration solution quantity introduced into the flow channel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> passes through the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to the output section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, it passes over a number of electrodes as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

The heat plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is in contact with the Peltier-effect device of the thermal block assembly <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> described below. The thermal block assembly <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is capable of changing and controlling the temperature of the heat plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> between 15&deg; C. and 75&deg; C. The temperature change and control is monitored by a thermistor <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and regulated by the microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. An internal digital clock of the microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> controls time and can switch on and switch off the thermal block assembly <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> according to a preset program.

<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Measurement of creatinine in a blood sample requires two electrodes. One electrode measures the total concentration of creatinine and creatine and the other electrode measures the concentration of only creatine. The concentration of creatinine is determined by subtraction of creatine from the combined creatine and creatinine concentrations. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the next two electrodes, creatinine <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and creatine <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, which like the glucose electrode <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and lactate electrode <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, function by detection of H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>produced by enzymatic reaction in their respective enzyme layers.

<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, two silver wires <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are staked through the thickness of the plastic substrate board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> into the reference solution well <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to act as the on-board reference electrode. Use of two silver wires <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> which are electrically connected assures continuous contact between the silver wire and the reference solution in the presence of air bubbles. Air bubbles may form in the reference channel as a result of degassing the reference solution at the elevated temperature of the sensor control. A printed circuit element <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, also illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, extends along the back of the panel between the one end of this reference electrode and edge of the board to provide an edge connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> The specific construction and operation of the electrodes will now be described in detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> Specifics of Ion Selective Electrodes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The details of ion-selective electrodes are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,214,968, incorporated by reference herein, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,734,184, incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Ion-selective membranes of this type, which are also known as liquid membranes, constitute a polymeric matrix with a non-volatile plasticizer which forms the liquid phase in which an ion carrier or selector commonly referred to as an ionophore, which imparts selectivity to the membrane, is dispersed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Ion-Selective Membrane Polymer </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Polymers for use in the ion-selective membrane of the instant invention include any of the hydrophobic natural or synthetic polymers capable of forming thin films of sufficient permeability to produce, in combination with the ionophores and ionophore solvent(s), apparent ionic mobility thereacross. Specifically, polyvinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, acrylonitrile, polyurethanes (particularly aromatic polyurethanes), copolymers of polyvinyl chloride and polyvinylidene chloride, polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl formal, polyvinylacetate, silicone elastomers, and copolymers of polyvinyl alcohol, cellulose esters, polycarbonates, carboxylated polymers of polyvinyl chloride and mixtures and copolymers of such materials have been found useful. Films of such materials which include the ionophores and plasticizers may be prepared using conventional film coating or casting techniques and, as shown in the examples below, may be formed either by coating and film formation directly over the internal reference electrode or some suitable interlayer or by formation separately and lamination thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Ionophore </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The ionophore used in the ion-selective membrane is generally a substance capable of selectively associating or binding to itself preferentially a desired specific alkali metal, alkaline earth, ammonium or other ions. Suitable ionophores are more fully described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> The selectivity of the electrode for a particular ion is due to the chemical nature of the ionophore and, thus, the use of different chemical components as the ionophore provides different membranes for use in ion-selective electrodes specific to different ions. Exemplary of such components are a large number of substances, some of them known to be antibiotics, which includes: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> (1) valinomycin, a potassium-selective ionophore; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> (2) cyclic polyethers of various constitution which make the membrane selective to lithium, rubidium, potassium, cesium or sodium; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> (3) other substances having ion selectivity similar to valinomycin such as other substances of the valinomycin group, tetralactones, macrolide actins (monactin, nonactin, dinactin, trinactin), the enniatin group (enniatin A, B), cyclohexadepsipeptides, gramicidine, nigericin, dianemycin, nystatin, monensin, esters of monensin (especially methyl monensin for sodium ion-selective membranes), antamanide, and alamethicin (cyclic polypeptides). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Numerous other useful materials are described in the foregoing publications and patents, as well as other literature on this subject. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The concentration of ionophore in the membrane will, of course, vary with the particular carrier used, the ion undergoing analysis, the plasticizer, etc. It has generally been found, however, that ionophore concentrations of below about 0.1 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>of membrane assuming the membrane thicknesses preferred herein result in marginal and generally undesirable responses. lonophore concentrations of between about 0.3 and about 0.5 g/m<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>are preferred. The ionophore can be incorporated at levels much higher than this; however, because of the cost of many of these materials, use of such levels is not economically sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Plasticizer </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> The plasticizer provides ion mobility in the membrane and, the presence of a plasticizer is necessary to obtain good ion transfer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> The plasticizer must, of course, be compatible with the membrane polymer and be a solvent for the ionophore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> The other highly desirable characteristic is that the plasticizer be sufficiently insoluble in water that it does not migrate significantly into an aqueous sample contacted with the surface of the membrane as described hereinafter. Generally, an upper solubility limit in water would be about 4.0 g/l with a preferred limit lying below about 1 g/l. Within these limits, substantially any solvent for the ionophore which is also compatible with the polymer may be used. It is also desirable that the ion plasticizer be substantially non-volatile to provide extended shelf-life for the electrode. Among the useful solvents are phthalates, sebacates, aromatic and aliphatic ethers, phosphates, mixed aromatic aliphatic phosphates, adipates, and mixtures thereof. Specific useful plasticizers include trimellitates, bromophenyl phenyl ether, dimethylphthalate, dibutylphthalate, dioctylphenylphosphonate, bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, octyldiphenyl phosphate, tritolyl phosphate, tris(3-phenoxyphenyl) phosphate, tris(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate, and dibutyl sebacate. Particularly preferred among this class are bromophenyl phenyl ether and trimellitates for potassium electrodes using valinomycin as the carrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> A large number of other useful plasticizers permit assembly of electrodes of the type described herein and may be used in the successful practice of the instant invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The concentration of plasticizer in the membrane will also vary greatly with the components of a given membrane; however, weight ratios of plasticizer to polymer of between about 1:1 to about 5:2 provide useful membranes. The thickness of the membrane will affect electrode response as described in somewhat more detail below, and it is preferred to maintain the thickness of this layer below about 5 mils and preferably about 1 mil. As also described in greater detail below, the uniformity of thickness of the ion selective membrane plays an important role in the optimum utilization of electrodes of the type described herein. Thus, if maximum advantage in terms of storage capability is to be obtained, the ion-selective membrane should be of relatively uniform thickness as defined above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Support </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the electrodes of the present invention include a support or card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which may be comprised of any material capable of bearing, either directly or by virtue of some intervening adhesion-improving layer, the other necessary portions of the electrode which are described in detail hereinafter. Thus, the support may comprise ceramic, wood, glass, metal, paper or cast, extruded or molded plastic or polymeric materials, etc. The composition of the support carrying the overlying electrode components must be inert; i.e., it does not interfere with the indicating potentials observed as, for example, by reacting with one of the overlying materials in an uncontrolled fashion. Moreover, the composition of the support must withstand elevated temperatures to which the sensors will be exposed, for the time length required to hydrate and/or calibrate the sensors. In the case of porous materials such as wood, paper or ceramics, it may be desirable to seal the pores before applying the overlying electrode components. The means of providing such a sealing are well known and no further discussion of the same is necessary here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> According to a highly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the support comprises a sheet or film of an insulating polymeric material. A variety of film-forming polymeric materials are well suited for this purpose, such as, for example, cellulose acetate, poly(ethylene terephthalate), polycarbonates, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, etc. The polymeric support may be of any suitable thickness typically from about 20-200 mils. Similarly thin layers or surfaces of other materials mentioned above could be used. Methods for the formation of such layers are well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> Specifics of Enzyme Electrode </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> An enzyme sensor comprises a three-electrode system including a working, reference and counter electrode. The working electrode includes a composite membrane that is deposited on a surface in contact with a conductive wire, a platinum wire for example. The composite membrane comprises two or more layers, including a enzyme layer and an inner interference rejection membrane, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> The sensor fabrication may be based on solvent casting techniques well known in the art. The thickness of the layers can be controlled by dispensing precise volumes of solutes found in the layers. The polymeric membrane that comprises an inner interference rejection membrane, described in detail below, is formed onto the wire electrode by electropolymerization of electropolymerizable monomers, as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, an enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, such as a glucose electrode, is located in the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the sensor card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> is an enlarged section of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. The enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> includes a three layer composite membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprising, from the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, an outer membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> adjacent to the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, an enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, located between the outer membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and an inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> adjacent a wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> contacts the sample as the sample flows along the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and over the outer membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The electrical signal generated by the enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is carried by the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and transferred to the conductor <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> which is in electrical communication with the electrode assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Referring still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, the outer membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> generally functions to control the diffusion of the analyte into the enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and to protect the other components of the electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> from direct contact with constituents of the sample in channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the outer membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is a polymeric membrane comprising one or more polyurelhane-based compounds. The hydrophobicity of the membrane is determined by the mixture of species of polymer compounds. As the hydrophobicity of the membrane increases, the ability of oxygen to diffuse through the membrane increases while the ability of analytes to diffuse through the membrane decreases. The preferred composition of the outer membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is the concentration in which an optimal balance of diffusion rates of oxygen, which is a required substrate of the enzymatic reactions, and analyte (lactate in a lactate sensor, or creatinine and creatine in a creatinine sensor, and glucose in a glucose sensor) exists under typical conditions. A highly hydrophobic outer membrane may be preferred because oxygen will diffuse quickly to the enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and thus will not be a limiting factor to the enzymatic reaction. The outer membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> may have a preferable thickness of 8 to 15 microns and could function with a thickness in the range of 5 to 30 microns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The outer membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is composed of a blend of polyurethanes with different water uptake levels. A typical composition of the outer membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is 77% aliphatic, polyether-based polyurethane with 20% water uptake, 17% aliphatic, polyether-based polyurethane with 60% water uptake, and 6% aliphatic, polyether-based polyurethane with 3% water uptake. The outer membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> with this composition can be produced by dispensing a volume from a solution of 3.0 mL cyclohexanone solvent, 17.0 mL tetrahydrofuran solvent, 1.08 g of 20% water uptake polyurethane, 0.24 g as 60% water uptake polyurethane and 0.08 g as 3% water uptake polyurethane onto the enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the composite membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the outer membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, which is layered directly onto and in contact with the enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, functions to preserve the enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> by preventing exposure of an enzyme <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> embedded in enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, and the stabilizing matrix in which the enzyme <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> is embedded, to clegradatory proteins or compounds from the sample in channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Likewise, outer membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> prevents diffusion of the enzyme <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> out of the enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The outer membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> also functions to control the rate of diffusion of analyte (e.g. glucose, lactate, creatine and creatinine) and oxygen from the sample to the enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. Failing to control the diffusion of the analyte and oxygen to the enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> results in non-linear and inaccurate measurements of the analyte in the sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> Referring still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the glucose or lactate sensor, includes at least one enzyme <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> species required for the enzymatic reaction in which the specific analyte participates that is stabilized in the matrix of the enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the enzyme <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> includes at least one protein with enzymatic activity. In other embodiments, enzyme <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> includes a mixture of several enzymes, proteins and stabilizers, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> In a particular embodiment of the invention, the protein enzyme <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> glucose oxidase or lactate oxidase are embedded in the enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and create an electrode <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> specifically sensitive to glucose and lactate, respectively, present in the sample. The glucose electrode <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> includes glutaraldehyde and glucose oxidase in the enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the glucose electrode <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> may include 0.10 g of glutaraldehyde per gram of glucose oxidase. In a particular embodiment, the lactate electrode <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> includes at least glutaraldehyde, bovine serum albumin, a enzyme stablizer such as, for example, polyethyleneimine and lactate oxidase in the enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the lactate electrode <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> includes 45% lactate oxidase by weight, 45% bovine serum albumin by weight, 5% polyethylenimine (an enzyme stabilizer) by weight and 5% glutaraldehyde by weight, for example. The weight fractions of lactate oxidase and bovine serum albumin can vary. The weight percent of polyethylenimine in the enzyme layer can vary from 1 to 20, and the weight percent of glutaraldehyde can vary from 1 to 10. Other enzymes stabilizers include but are not limited to polyionic compounds such as polypropyleneimine, poly(N-vinylimidazole), polyallylamine, polyvinylpiridine, polyvinylpyrollidone, polylysine, protamine and their derivatives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment of the invention, enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> includes a mixture of several enzymes, proteins, and stabilizers embedded in the matrix of enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> for specific detection of creatinine and creatine or creatine only. Enzyme mixtures are used in the creatinine electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and creatine electrode <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Creatine alone is detected with the creatine electrode <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. In a particular embodiment, creatinine electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> includes a mixture of 5% creatininase by weight, 55% creatinase by weight, 30% sarcosine oxidase by weight, 5% poly(N-vinylimidazole) (an enzyme stabilizer) by weight and 5% glutaraldehyde by weight, for example. The weight fractions of creatininase, creatinase and sarcosine exidase in the creatinine electrode and the weight fractions of creatinase and sarcosine oxidase in the creatine electrode can vary. The weight percent of poly(N-vinylimidazole) in creatinine and creatine electrodes can vary, for example, from 1% to 20%, and the weight percent of glutaraldehyde in the creatinine and creatine electrodes can also vary, for example, from 1% to 10%. Polyionic stabilizers, other than poly(N-vinylimidazole), can also be used for stabilizing the enzyme mixture. Examples of polyionic compounds include but are not limited to polyethylenimine, polypropyleneimine, polyallylamine, polyvinylpiridine, polyvinylpyrollidone, polylysine, protamine, and their derivatives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the glucose, lactate, creatine, and creatinine electrodes, the enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> consists of a cross-linked matrix of enzymes, stabilizers such as polyethylenimine or poly(N-vinylimidazole), and other proteins such as bovine serum albumin. Cross-linking of the enzymes, stabilizers, and other protein molecules is accomplished with, for example, glutaraldehyde, a dialdehyde. Other cross-linking reagents, such as 1,4-diisocyanatobutane, a diisocyanato, 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane and 1,2,9,10-diepoxydecane, both diepoxides, can also be used. Cross-linking of the enzyme molecules and the use of the polyionic stabilizers and inert proteins in the enzyme matrix can significantly extend the shelf-life and the use-life of the enzyme electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment of the invention related to the creatinine <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and creatine <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> electrodes, enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> includes a mixture of several enzymes, proteins, but lacks an enzyme stabilizer. In this embodiment, the creatinine electrode <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> includes a mixture of 30% creatininase, 30% creatinase, 30% sarcosine oxidase and 10% glutaraldehyde (percentages by weight). In this embodiment, the creatine electrode <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> includes a mixture of 45% creatinase, 45% sarcosine oxidase and 10% glutaraldehyde (percentages by weight). The enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> may have a thickness in the range of 1 to 10 microns, preferably 2-5 microns measured from the inner surface of the outer membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to the outer surface of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, the enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> also includes an inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> which is a restorable polymeric membrane in close contact to the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may be formed by the polymerization of electropolymerizable monomers. Suitable electropolymerizable monomers include benzothiophene, phenylenediamines, and phenols, for example. The inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, which is typically less than a micron thick, insulates or protects the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> from compounds in the sample, specifically oxidizable compounds, that interfere with the proper functioning of the enzyme electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment according to the invention, the polymeric membrane comprising the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is formed by the application of an electrical potential to the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in the presence of electropolymerizable monomers. The monomers in the presence of an electrical potential polymerize on the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> to form an electrically insulating polymeric inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> on the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>. Hydrogen peroxide, which is generated from activity of the enzyme of the enzyme electrode on a specific analyte, passes through the pores of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and contacts the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> causing an electrical signal to be generated at the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. The smaller size of the pores in the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> restricts compounds found in the sample, larger than hydrogen peroxide, such as acetaminophen, ascorbic acid, uric acid, cysteine and other electroactive compounds that are larger than H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>from interfering with and reducing accuracy of the electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> of the electrochemical sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the invention, the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> may be regenerated on a repeated basis to restore its function. Following repeated exposure to many samples, the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is degraded or fouled by compounds present in the sample. Degradation of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is characterized by fissures in the polymeric structure of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Such fissures prevent the ability of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> to protect the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> from interfering compounds present in the analytical sample, e.g., ascorbic acid, acetaminophen, and uric acid, from contacting the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and altering the electrical signal detected by the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid problems induced by the degradation of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, an electropolymerizable monomer can be combined with a calibration solution, such as solution AO contained in the prepackaged container <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the electrochemical sensor system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, for example, for use in the repolymerization and restoration of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Polymerization of the monomer occurs when a monomer-containing AO solution is pumped from a prepackaged container and passed through the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> on the sensor card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> during the application of an electrical potential generated by electrochemical sensor apparatus <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. During the polymerization process the monomer in the calibration solution in flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> diffuses through the outer membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> until reaching the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Once at the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> the monomers present in the solution enter the areas of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> that have lost structural integrity by degradation, splitting or cracking, and mediate the restoration of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> by polymerizing to fill in the damaged structure of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The monomer is exposed to an electrical potential generated from an electrical source and transferred to the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in the areas of lost integrity of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. The electrical potential polymerizes the monomer onto the existing polymeric structure of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> at damaged areas of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> until the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is restored. Once the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is restored the insulating properties of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is renewed and the monomer present at the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is sequestered from the electrical potential of the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. This self-limiting restoration of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is automatically repeated every 24 hours, for example. Regular, automatic, self-limiting restoration of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> ensures accuracy of the enzyme sensor <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. More or less frequent restoration cycles of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> can be employed to account for different situations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The electrical potential for the polymerization process generated by the electrochemical sensor system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is applied to the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> in the range of 0.1 to 0.8 V versus the on-board reference electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, for about 30 seconds to one hour. An optimal polarization potential is 0.5 V versus the on-board reference electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for 3 minutes, repeated every 24 hours. The electrical potential is too low if it does not cause the polymerization reaction and the electrical potential is too high if it causes water hydrolysis and gas formation at the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> thus causing damage to the enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> Specifics of the pO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>Electrode </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> An oxygen sensor comprises a three electrode system including a working electrode, a reference electrode and a ground electrode. In one embodiment of the invention, the oxygen working electrode <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> comprises a platinum wire <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> that is fixed in the center of an insulative glass disk <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and two protective membranes <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The disk preferably has a thickness of approximately <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> mils while the board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may have a thickness of approximately 85 mils. The diameter of the glass disk is preferably about 100 mils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> A number of the glass disks with the embedded platinum wires are prepared by inserting a close-fitting length of platinum wire into the lumen of a glass capillary tube and then melting the tube so that it fuses to the wire. After the tube with the embedded wire hardens, the disks of given axial thickness are sliced off, by a power saw, for example. The glass disk is practically impervious to oxygen whereas the polyvinylchloride of the board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is relatively pervious. The glass disk thus protects the platinum electrode <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> from the gas so that only its distal end that faces the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is active. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The two membranes <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> on the glass disk protect the platinum wire <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> from direct contact with the constituents of the sample in channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the membrane <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is a hydrogel based on methacrylic esters that is covalently bonded to the glass disk. The membrane <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> underneath the <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> covers only the area around the platinum wire and is made of polyvinyl alcohol. The composite membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> including <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> provides a better protection and sensor performance than either of the membranes alone. The type of hydrogel that is employed is based on methacrylic esters, although hydrogels not based on esters of methacrylic acid may be used. To form a gel, the monomer, such as hydroxyethyl methacrylate or hydroxypropyl methacrylate, for example, is copolymerized with a cross-linker, such as, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate or tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate. The cross-linking reaction can be initiated by a photoinitiator such as dimethoxyphenylacetophenone. A solvent such as ethylene glycol or water can be used to dilute reactions and control the viscosity of the solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0142" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0142&rsqb;</number> It is of considerable advantage that the hydrogel membrane does not peel away from the surface of the oxygen electrode when the membrane hydrates. This is achieved by functionalization of the glass disk with methacrylic groups and cross-link the membrane to the surface. The surface of the glass disk is silinized with hexamethyldisilazane and functionalized with methacrylic groups by reacting with trimethoxysilyl propyl methacrylate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0143" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0143&rsqb;</number> After functionalization of the glass disk, a small drop of a solution of polyvinyl alcohol in water is dispensed at the center of the disk directly over the platinum wire and the water is allowed to evaporate for formation of the polyvinyl alcohol membrane. A solution of hydrogel component as described above is then dispensed on the disk in an amount corresponding to 50-micron thick film. The disk is exposed to a broad band UV light for 5 min to photopolymerized the hydrogel membrane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0144" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0144&rsqb;</number> The glass disk with the composite membrane on one side of it is embedded in a recessed form through the thickness of the plastic board <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> so that the non-hydrogel surface is flush with the surface of the board opposite the cover plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the hydrogel surface of the disk is flush with the bottom of the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0145" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0145&rsqb;</number> The oxygen sensor described here has several advantages when compared to the conventional electrode (Clark electrode), including smaller electrode size, simpler electrode fabrication, faster response time and longer use life. Separation of the reference and the counter electrodes form the working electrode allows for smaller size of the working electrode and simpler electrode fabrication. The oxygen response time is reduced because of the absence of internal solution and the resulting thinner membrane over the working electrode. The use of external reference electrode eliminates the silver dendrite formation on the working electrode, which is a common mode of failure in a Clark oxygen electrode with an internal Ag/AgCl reference electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0146" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0146&rsqb;</number> Concerning the amperometric function of the electrode in operation, a negative potential relative to the on-board reference electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is applied to the platinum wire <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> by the processor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which lessened potential serves to reduce any oxygen reaching its end and thereby produces an electrical current proportional to the oxygen diffusion through the layers <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> The hydrated layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> affords a reliable conductive flow path between the platinum electrode and the on-board reference electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to provide a polarization potential between the platinum and the solution in the hydrated layer. The resulting current flow between the platinum electrode <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the ground electrode is measured and is proportional to the oxygen concentration in the test fluid being monitored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0147" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0147&rsqb;</number> pCO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, pH Potassium, Sodium and Calcium Sensing Electrodes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0148" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0148&rsqb;</number> The electrodes, best illustrated generally in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, connecting the silver wires <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which sense Na, Ca, potassium, pCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and pH activities, respectively, are similar in construction. The difference is in the composition of the membrane layers. A typical ion-selective electrode is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Each has a bead or an inner salt layer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, which upon hydration forms the inner solution layer. This layer is in contact with the thin film of silver/silver chloride layer <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> obtained by anodization of the top of the silver wires. The outer layer <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is essentially the polymeric ion-selective membrane layer. This layer is formed over the dried salt residue of the inner layer in a shallow well <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as a dry residue remaining after the solvent removal from a matrix of a permeable hydrophobic membrane forming solution such as a solution containing polyvinylchloride, a plasticizer, an appropriate ion-sensing active ingredient and a borate salt. The outer membrane is applied as a solution, typically in Tetrahydrofuran (THF) in a small droplet. Once the solvent evaporates, the membrane is formed and is bonded to the plastic card. In the case of pH and pCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>electrodes, the ion-selective active ingredient may be tridodecylamine (TDDA) or a suitable pH sensing component. For the potassium electrode, a monocyclic antibiotic such as valinomycin may be used as the active ingredient. The calcium electrode employs a calcium ion-selective sensing component as its active ingredient such as (&minus;)-(R,R)-N,N&prime;-(Bis(11-ethoxycarbonyl)undecyl)-N,N&prime;-4,5-tetramethyl-3,6-dioxaoctanediamide; Diethyl N,N&prime;-&lsqb;(4R,5R)-4,5-dimethyl-1,8-dioxo-3,6-dioxaoctamethylene&rsqb;-bis(12-methylaminododecanoate) or other suitable calcium sensitive selective substance. The sodium electrode employs methyl monensin ester or any other suitable sodium sensitive active ingredient. The sodium, potassium and calcium electrodes use a buffer salt like MES (2-&lsqb;Nmorpholino&rsqb;ethanesulphonic acid) along with the respective chloride salts for their inner solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0149" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0149&rsqb;</number> pH and pCO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>electrodes share the same outer layers, while their inner layers differ significantly. The internal layer for pH uses a strong buffer, for example, MES buffer, while that for CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>electrode use a bicarbonate buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0150" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0150&rsqb;</number> All ion-selective electrodes, except CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>electrode, operate through the measurement of the potential between the ion-selective electrode and the reference electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), the change in potential is directly proportional to the change in the logarithm of the activity of the measured ion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0151" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0151&rsqb;</number> The CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>sensor is a combination of CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and pH electrodes working together. In function the potential between the CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and pH electrode is measured. The outer surface of both electrodes respond to pH in the same manner and cancel each other. The inner surface of the pH membrane has a high buffer with constant pH and does not cause any change in the measured potential. However, for CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, the membrane is freely permeable to CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>,, which dissolves in the bicarbonate buffer changing its pH. This causes a change in the potential response of the inner surface of the CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>membrane, which is the only change to the overall measured potential. Thus, the potential across the CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and pH electrodes directly measures the variation in the CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>concentrations of the sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0152" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0152&rsqb;</number> The process of hydrating the inner salt layer in these ion-selective electrodes is achieved by soaking the outer surface of the outer membranes in an aqueous salt solution, usually a calibrating reagent solution. The hydration, however, is a very slow process, as the water has to permeate through the hydrophobic outer membrane in the vapor form. Thermal cycling through high temperatures facilitates the process. During the process of thermal cycling, the composition and integrity of the membrane layers stay intact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0153" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0153&rsqb;</number> Hydration and calibration of the ion sensing electrodes are accomplished by steps similar to those described for the pO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>electrode. Hydration from a dry state can be accelerated by soaking the sensors in an electrolyte solution, such as the calibrating solutions described above, and thermally cycling the sensors through an elevated temperature higher than that of normal use. For example, the sensors are soaked in calibrating solution B at a temperature between 55&deg; C. to 75&deg; C. for 15 minutes, and then cooled to 37&deg; C. The calibration cycles start as soon as the temperature reaches 37&deg; C. In a preferred embodiment, the sensors are soaked in a calibrating solution at a temperature of 60&deg; C. for 12 minutes, and then cooled to 37&deg; C. The calibration cycles start as soon as the temperature returns to 37&deg; C. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0155" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0155&rsqb;</number> The hematocrit (Hct) measurement is made through a measurement of resistivity between gold wires <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The sensor operates by measuring the resistivity of the solution or blood sample placed between the electrodes. Hematocrit is calculated as a function of resistivity using the Maxwell equation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0156" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0156&rsqb;</number> Removal of Interfering Agents </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0157" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0157&rsqb;</number> Exposure of the enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to the sample in the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> causes the composite membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to retain residual concentrations of substrate from the sample and products of the enzymatic reaction from the operation of the enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. These substances are examples of the interfering agents that will cause the enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to lose accuracy and precision in measurement of the specifically intended analyte. In order to restore accuracy and precision to the enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, interfering agents are removed from the composite membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> by applying an additional amplitude of polarization to the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> of the enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0158" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0158&rsqb;</number> A polarization pulse may be applied by an electrical source to the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> after each exposure of the electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to a sample in order to prepare the electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> for the next measurement. For example, hydrogen peroxide, a product of the reaction of the enzyme and the analyte from the operation of the electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, is an example of an interfering agent. To remove interfering agents such as hydrogen peroxide, an additional amplitude of polarization is applied to the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> which causes oxidation of the interfering agent. Oxidation of the interfering agent renders the interfering agent incapable of affecting the electrical activity at the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> by effectively removing the agents from the electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The analytes, such as glucose and lactate, also constitute interfering agents when residual concentrations of glucose and lactate remain in the enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> between sample readings. A polarization pulse applied to the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> oxidizes the residual analyte and thus eliminates contribution of residual analyte between samples to erroneous analyte measurements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0159" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0159&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment according to the invention, after measurement of an analyte in a sample is complete, the enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is restored by pumping the sample out of the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and a volume of wash solution from reservoir <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is pumped through the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. During this time, an additional polarization is superimposed on the stable polarization continuously applied to the electrodes <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> after a sample measurement. The polarization is then returned to its baseline level and a calibration solution is introduced into the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> followed by a one-point calibration to ready the electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> for the next measurement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0160" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0160&rsqb;</number> The sufficient amplitude and duration of the polarization pulse required for the oxidation of interfering agent is determined by the geometry of the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Greater pulse amplitudes and longer pulse durations are required for an electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> with a narrow flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and a slow flow rate of wash solution. In a preferred embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A, a</cross-reference> polarization amplitude of 0.4 V versus the on-board reference electrode for a duration of 50 seconds is sufficient to eliminate interfering compounds from the composite membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and thus improve accuracy and precision of the electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> measurements. A polarization amplitude in the range from 0.1 to 0.8 V versus the on-board reference electrode for a duration of 10 to 200 seconds may also be sufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0161" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0161&rsqb;</number> Restoration of the Inner (Interference Rejection) Membrane of the Composite Membrane </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0162" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0162&rsqb;</number> A further step to restore the function of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the composite membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the enzyme sensor <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> illustrated, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. This step includes restoration of the integrity and proper functioning of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the enzyme electrodes. Within the composite membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> restoration of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> occurs by the in situ polymerization of electropolymerizable monomers onto the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the composite membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0163" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0163&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the electropolymerizable monomers are in solution in the AO calibration solution in container <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> The AO calibration solution is passed through the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the sensor card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. The AO solution with the electropolymerizable monomers contact the enzyme electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> at the outer polymeric membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the composite membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The electropolymerizable monomers diffuse first through the outer membrane <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, and then through the enzyme layer <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the composite membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, until the monomers reach the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the composite membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. An electrical potential greater than baseline, 0.5 V versus the on-board reference electrode for is applied to the wire <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> for 3 minutes, for example, causing the electropolymerizable monomers to polymerize onto the existing polymeric structure of inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the composite membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Following the polymerization of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, the insulating properties of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are restored. Because the remaining electropolymerizable monomers in the calibration solution are no longer exposed to the electrical potential, polymerization of the monomers can no longer occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0164" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0164&rsqb;</number> The amplitude of the electrical potential and the period of time of the elevated potential sufficient for restoration of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the composite membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is determined by the specific configuration of the electrode <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. The composition and the particular geometry of electrode affects the amplitude of the electrical potential and the period of time required for complete restoration of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. A composite membrane <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of a composition or geometry that slows the diffusion of monomers from the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> will require a greater polymerization amplitude for a greater duration of time. A polarization of about 0.1 to 0.8 V versus an on-board reference electrode applied for about 30 seconds to 1 hour is suitable for at least partial restoration of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Once the restoration of the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is complete, the AO solution in flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is replaced with rinse solution <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the electrical potential is returned to baseline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0165" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0165&rsqb;</number> Reference Solution Operation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0166" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0166&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, as has been noted, the reference solution fills the well <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> where it contacts a silver wire <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and is pumped through the capillary channel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to join the outlet of the main flow line. The reference solution is essentially a hypertonic solution of potassium nitrate, with respect to the blood or the calibrating solutions and accordingly the domain of the reference electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> constitutes a stable potential liquid junction formed between the reference electrode and the blood or calibrating solution, thereby establishing an environment that is independent of the ionic activity of the blood or calibrating solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0167" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0167&rsqb;</number> Since the reference solution joins the main flow channel downstream from the electrodes, it does not affect those measurements in any way. The reference solution is of high density and under pumping force must flow upward against gravity to the outlet. Thus, when the pump stops, as for electrode equilibration, the reference solution remains stationary in the reference well <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the capillary section <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and tends not to diffuse into the calibrating solution or blood in the main flow channel. Thus, the capillary tube <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> due to the density gradient, acts as a one way valve allowing pumped reference solution to pass upwardly through the capillary but preventing unwanted reverse passage or mixing of the blood or calibrating solution into the reference well. </paragraph>

A cable <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> connects the electrical connectors from the sensor card to a microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through an analog board <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). A printed circuit board (analog board located before the processor) controls the sensors and measures sensor output. Printed circuit boards within this heater block assembly contain post amplifiers that amplify signals from the sensor in the sensor card. The output of the sensors are analog signals. The analog signals are converted to digital signals via an analog to digital converter, and the digital signals are transmitted to the microprocessor for storage, analysis, and display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0171" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0171&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>C, the interior surface <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> of aluminum shell <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>comes into contact with the metal plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of a sensor cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>).

Thermoelectric devices in the heater block assembly may use, for example, the Peltier-effect, to heat and cool the aluminum block. Electrical leads <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>&prime; supply programmed electrical current controlled by a microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the thermoelectric device <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0176" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0176&rsqb;</number> Initial Operation of the Assembly </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0177" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0177&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, when the cartridge with the sensor assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the filled bags <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are first used, the valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is controlled to direct one of the calibration solutions for example, calibration solution B, into the sensor assembly so it entirely fills the flow channel. The pump is then stopped for a period of 10-30 minutes, preferably 12-15 minutes during which the dry chemical sensor electrodes are hydrated by thermal cycling, for example, from 37&deg; C. to 60&deg; C. and back to 37&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0178" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0178&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the dry chemical electrode sensor assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted into the electrochemical sensor system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and the valve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is controlled by microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to direct the calibration solutions B into the sensor assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thermal block assembly <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is set at a temperature whereby the temperature of thermal plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is sufficient to heat the calibrating solution in contact with the dry chemical sensor to a temperature in a range of 55&deg; C. to 75&deg; C., preferably 60&deg; C., for 10-30 minutes, preferably 12 minutes. After the specified time period, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> reverses current flow through the thermoelectric device to cool thermal plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The sensor card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and calibrating solution in contact with thermal plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are cooled to 37&deg; C. The temperature, controlled by the microprocessor <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, is maintained at 37&deg; C. for the life of the cartridge <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. After hydration of the sensors, the conditioning cycle of the enzyme electrodes <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> starts by pumping the AO solution <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to the sensor card <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and soaking the electrodes <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> for 1 to 6 minutes, preferably, for 3 minutes while the polarization potential of the enzyme electrodes <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is elevated from 0.25 to 0.5 V versus the on-board reference electrode. During the AO exposure, the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of the enzyme electrodes <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, is restored. Moreover, in this cycle the low oxygen level is also calibrated. Upon completion of the AO cycle, the rinse cycle starts by pumping rinse solution from prepackaged container <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> the flow channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by the peristalic pump <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. During the rinse cycle the polarization potential of the enzyme electrodes <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is changed from 0.5 to 0.4 V in order to accelerate the removal of the AO residues from the inner interference rejection membrane <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Following the completion of the rinse cycle, the polarization potential of the enzyme electrodes <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> are lowered back to normal level of about 0.25 V versus the on-board reference electrode. A calibration cycle with solutions A 14 and B 16 then begins.
