<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to removing pollutants from wastewater and more particularly to the separation and removal of total suspended solids (TSS) such as fats, oil and grease (FOG), and non-grease solids (e.g. food scraps), which produce an undesirable biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Still more particularly, the present invention relates to an apparatus and method for pre-treating wastewater from restaurants, food processing facilities and other industrial operations to reduce the concentration of total suspended solids (TSS) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) contaminants, which place a burden on sewage piping and sewage treatment facilities. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Typical food preparation and clean up operations generate wastewater with high contents of foodstuff, grease and animal fat. A particular problem occurs when small molecules of grease unite with food particles and other waste and accumulate on the inside of pipelines, clogging drainage lines from sinks, dishwashers and the like. As this wastewater is discharged into the sewage system, liquid FOG cools and solidifies with other solids, accumulating on the inside walls of the wastewater pipe. As this deposited layer grows, it obstructs the flow of wastewater to the treatment facility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The removal of these obstructions is a costly and time-consuming process. In addition, elevated levels of FOG can disrupt the treatment of waste-water at municipal facilities. Consequently, applicable governmental regulations now require removal of fats, oil and grease (FOG) from wastewater in many instances. In particular, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated regulations establishing standards for acceptable total suspended solids (TSS), including fats, oil and grease (FOG), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) content in wastewater prior to discharge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Because of these regulations, sewage treatment authorities have sought ways to cope with the burdens placed on their facilities by the total suspended solids (TSS), including fats, oil and grease (FOG), being discharged into the sewers. They have focused on commercial kitchen operations, such as restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, etc., to attempt to reduce the amount of such materials received or at least equitably spread the cost of treating their wastewater. One of the methods authorities have used is to apply a surcharge (fine) to sewage bills of commercial kitchen operations to reflect the added demands put upon the sewage treatment facility by sewage emanating from them. These surcharges have been levied by authorities in several ways; some inspect and levy based upon just fats, oil and grease (FOG), others by total suspended solids (TSS) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). In some situations, treatment authorities have required that commercial kitchens simply stop discharging into the sewers. These remedies have imposed a financial burden upon commercial kitchens but do not provide a solution in most cases and do not reduce the actual burden of pipeline clean up or treatment facilities operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In order to avoid surcharges and reduce the burden of pipeline clean up, it has become desirable for commercial kitchens and similar operations to remove substantially all of the total suspended solids (TSS) from their wastewater before it is discharged into a public sewage system. For example, many conventional FOG removal or recovery systems make use of the differences in specific gravity of FOG and water to permit gravitational separation of the FOG and water. Such systems typically rely on settling or other passive separator techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is also known to use grease traps, particularly inground grease traps, to separate floatable grease components from wastewater. A typical FOG-water separator, grease recovery unit (GRU) or grease trap includes a settling tank or compartment in which the wastewater is collected for gravitational separation and removal of FOG from the water. While the wastewater is within the settling container, the wastewater gradually separates into FOG and water, with the less dense FOG floating to the upper surface of the water. This upper portion, being heavily laden with FOG, is then intermittently removed from the settling container by manual removal, in the case of grease traps, or a skimming operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is also known to pass the effluent through settling tanks and strainers in order to remove large or heavy food particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The major difficulty with all the above devices is that they operate on the premise that all FOG has a lower specific gravity than the wastewater in which it is carried. They also do not provide the residence time that is typically necessary to allow the FOG to rise to the surface. For example, while some of the very small droplets of FOG (e.g. less than 10 microns) have a specific gravity lower than the water, their slow rise rate may not allow them to reach the surface during the time the waste is in the separation compartment. Additionally, some of the FOG may adhere to foodstuff, thereby becoming heavier than the water and sinking, or worse yet, attain the same specific gravity as the water and pass through into the sewage system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Although solids can be successfully treated in conventional sewage treatment facilities, those that contain large amounts of fats, oils and grease (FOG) require a very long residence time in the facility, which increases the expense of the treatment process. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a new apparatus/method that achieves separation of all the TSS, thereby eliminating the FOG and at the same time reducing BOD. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention is an apparatus and method for pre-treating wastewater from restaurants, food processing facilities and other industrial operations to reduce the concentration of total suspended solids (TSS) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) contaminants which place a burden on sewage piping and sewage treatment facilities. A preferred embodiment of the present apparatus for removing contaminants from contaminated water comprises a separation tank in which a first portion of the contaminants float to the top of the water, the tank having a water inlet and a water outlet, a coalescing device in the separation tank, the coalescing device including means for causing a portion of the contaminants to coalesce, a circulating mop that contacts the floating contaminants and removes them from the water, a mop-cleaning member that removes contaminants from the circulating mop, and a filter system through which water leaving the separation tank via the water outlet is passed. In still more particular embodiments, the coalescing device comprises a plurality of corrugated plates that define a tortuous fluid flow path therethrough, the circulating mop comprises a continuous loop of contaminant-absorbing material, the mop-cleaning member comprises a pair of rollers, and/or the tank inlet is configured to feed water into the tank in a direction that is substantially parallel to the wall of the tank. The preferred apparatus further includes a pressurization loop that receives water from the tank, pressurizes it, and returns it into the tank in a manner that causes fluid in the separation tank to flow around the perimeter of the tank and thus produces a toroidal fluid flow pattern in the tank, an air injection system that receives water from the tank, provides it with air bubbles, and returns it into the tank, and/or a receiving device for recovering contaminants removed from the mop.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an apparatus/method for removing nearly all FOG particles from wastewater and for reducing BOD therein. To better understand the removal mechanism, the invention may be divided into four main steps: (1) straining, (2) frothing (3) separating, and (4) filtering. These steps are discussed in detail below and are performed in the present apparatus, which is preferably configured as follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Apparatus </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the present invention comprises a strainer system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, frothing system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and filter system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring now also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>C, strainer system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> includes an inlet <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a non-pressurized vessel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> containing a perforated basket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and having a cover <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Basket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is preferably large enough to contain all the solids larger than its openings (holes) <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> that will be discharged within a day. In some embodiments, openings <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be in the range of {fraction (1/16)} inch to &frac14; inch in diameter depending on surface area and loading. Preferably openings <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be {fraction (1/16)} or &frac18; of an inch in diameter. Basket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be automatically cleaned or removed and dumped daily. Additionally, vessel <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has an overflow outlet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that allows dirty water to bypass strainer basket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> if it becomes clogged, full, or not in service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, frothing system <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> includes a round or oblong tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> containing a corrugated plate separator <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and an outlet pipe <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>. A dirty water line <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> carries strained water from strainer system <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to inlet <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> of tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The volume of tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is preferably at least three times the inlet flow rate per minute. For example, if the flow rate into the tank is 25 gallons per minute (gpm), the tank should hold at least 75 gallons. In some embodiments, tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may include a lid <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and hold-downs (not shown) that make it air tight, but it is preferred that, if present, these components are easily removed for maintenance and service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In some instances, it may be desirable to provide one or more immersion heaters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> within the volume of tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Heaters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be similar to those commonly found in large water heaters. Preferably, a heater <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be located directly below tank inlet <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> and below the height of the pump return fluid. The heater may operate at <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> volts, and is preferably designed for continuous duty. Heaters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may always remain on and should be appropriate size and number to maintain a constant temperature in the tank, preferably between 120&deg; F. and 130&deg; F. at all times. In some embodiments, the temperature in tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is controlled using feedback from a temperature sensor in the tank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Inlet <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is preferably tangentially oriented, so that in-flowing water flows along the side of tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the liquid moves around separator tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in toroidal flow. It is known that, for this type of flow pattern, the liquid velocity is smaller near the center of tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Liquid that has been in tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> the longest will be in this central region. For this reason, outlet pipe <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> is preferably provided with an intake <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> that is positioned so that it receives water from the center vortex. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Still more preferably, the intake <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> is disposed such that liquid from tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> must pass through corrugated plate separator <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> before flowing out through intake <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. Separator <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> removes the very small droplets of free oil and mechanically emulsified oil by capturing oil droplets when they make contact with its surface. As more and more droplets attach, they coalesce until they form large enough drops to rise at a rate sufficient to overcome the downward velocity of the liquid. Separator <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> preferably includes a plurality of plates <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>, which are configured so as to cause flow through the separator to be tortuous. The flow path through the separator is preferably tortuous so that droplets have an increased chance of contacting a separator surface and being captured. While a corrugated plate separator is used in this example, an incline plate separator or a coalescing pack, or other suitable device may also be used. In some embodiments, it may be preferable to include a cylindrical separator ring <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that surrounds separator <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and keeps water from by-passing separator <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In one preferred embodiment, separator plates <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> are spaced one and one-half inches (1&frac12;&Prime;) apart and compartmentalize every three and one-half inches (3&frac12;&Prime;). Preferably, each plate <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> has five flat surfaces, three of which are at 90-degree angles, and two of which are at 45-degree angles. Typically, three chevrons are pressed into the 45-degree surfaces. When a number of the plates are arranged in a pack, the liquid travels though plates in a tortuous flow pattern. For example, the water may enter separator <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and travel vertically for one inch. It then turns and travels at a 45-degree angle for three inches. The liquid may then travel vertically for one inch before turning back and traveling at 45 degrees in the opposite direction for three inches. Finally, the liquid resumes vertical travel before exiting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> After entering outlet <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> via intake <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, the clean liquid flows into water leg <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>, which has an inverted U-shape and includes ascending leg <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight>, lateral leg <highlight><bold>474</bold></highlight>, and descending leg <highlight><bold>476</bold></highlight>. Water leg <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> ensures that the liquid in tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is maintained at a constant level, as indicated at <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>. As discussed below, maintaining a constant liquid level in tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> helps ensure adequate residence time in tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, so as to allow natural gravitational separation to develop and coalescing time for air flotation. In come cases, the liquid may exceed constant water level <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>. Water leg <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> preferably includes a siphon breaker line <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to prevent siphoning. Preferably, tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> also includes a vent <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> located at or near the top of tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the upper portion of tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a mopping system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, which preferably includes a, an oleophilic continuous loop belt <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, preferably fabricated from a durable material such as nylon, with long fibers <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> sewn into it. Fibers <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> are preferably affixed to both sides of belt <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. The fibers <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> are preferably fabricated from a hydrophobic material such as polypropylene, polyethylene or any other polymerized resin to which FOG can adhere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2B</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, mopping system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is preferably configured such that a first portion of the path of belt <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> lies above the surface of the liquid in tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and a second portion of the path of belt <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> lies at or near the surface. Between the first and second portions, belt <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> passes between a pair of opposed rollers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Rollers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are preferably mounted such that the clearance between them is only slightly larger than the thickness of belt <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Material that is squeezed out of fibers <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> as shown at <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> drops into a trough <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, from which it flows via pipe <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>). It will be understood an variety of devices could be used to remove material from belt <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. Suitable alternatives to rollers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> include but are not limited to one or more combs, blades, scrapers, vacuum equipment and combinations thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> To support belt <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> in the preferred configuration, mopping system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> further includes at least two, preferably three or more drive/support rods <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> positioned in a spaced-apart arrangement as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Specifically, at least one rod, lower rod <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, maintains a portion of the belt path near the surface of the liquid. A second rod, upper rod <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, maintains a portion of the belt path above the surface of the liquid. A third rod, end rod <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is preferably laterally spaced apart from lower rod <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. If the diameter of at least one of the rods is large enough to lift a sufficient portion of belt <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> out of the liquid, lower rod <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or upper rod <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, one or both rollers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> drive belt <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and are driven in turn by a motor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment (not shown), one of rods <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> is driven by a motor and thus drives belt <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, while the remainder of rods <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> rotate passively. Belt <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and the drive rod(s) <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> can be provided with corresponding sets of teeth or the like, which allow the drive rod to more effectively engage belt <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, heavy solids tend to settle to the bottom of tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. A suction inlet <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is positioned at the bottom of tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and connected to a suction pump <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> via filtration line <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, allowing water and heavy solids to be drawn off simultaneously. In an alternative embodiment, the bottom of tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can be slightly conical, as shown in phantom at <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> ins <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, an additional outlet <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be provided to allow settled solids to be removed from tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The shape and utility of outlet <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> will depend in part on the nature of the solid wastes entering tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. A valve <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may be provided to control the flow through outlet <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring now also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, after passing through pump <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, liquid from filtration line <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is preferably fed into filter system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> via pressurized feed line <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. Filter system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a vessel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, first and second filters <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, a clean water outlet line <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, and a drain line <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. A valve <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> controls the flow through drain line <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and a valve <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> controls the flow through outlet line <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Filtration unit <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> is a duplex system, using two filters <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, having different mesh sizes. In some embodiments, a triplex filter may be used for very fine filtration. Depending upon the discharge specifications, filters may have various mesh sizes. Preferably, filter <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is relatively coarse (from about 75 microns to about 40 microns), while, filter <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is fine (between about 20 microns and about 10 microns). One or both of these filters may be constructed of woven wire mesh, sintered metal, woven fiber mesh, felt socks or the like. In a preferred embodiment, both filters are made of woven wire mesh. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> When selecting a filter material, filter vessel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> should be designed to insure that the filter elements can be easily removed and easily cleaned. It is important that the filters are designed with enough surface area to allow for an acceptable run time between cleaning and possess a low clean differential pressure drop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Filtered water that has passed through first and second filters <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> can leave vessel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> via either line <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> or line <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. Liquid leaving vessel <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> via line <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> enters either a gas-entraining line <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> or a liquid injection line <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>. Gas-entraining line <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> preferably includes an eductor <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>. As is known in the art, as liquid passes through eductor <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, air is entrained into the liquid stream. Air enters eductor <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> via a gas entrainment line <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, which includes an air intake <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> located either in the head space <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, as shown, or outside tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The rate of air flow through line <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> is controlled by a valve <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. When the air-flow through is restricted by valve <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> to a point very close to causing cavitation within eductor <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, very small bubbles (&lt;5 microns) are generated in the fluid flowing in line <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The contents of line <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> are injected into tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> via a tangential inlet <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, which is preferably located at about one-half the depth of the liquid in tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Because line <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> contains entrained air, this results in a flow of air bubbles into and up through the contents of tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, these small bubbles contribute to successful operation of the present air flotation process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Once the bubbles pass through the liquid in separation tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, they break back out into the head space <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> of tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Similarly, liquid injection line <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> feeds a liquid stream into tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> via a tangential inlet <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Since this liquid stream contains no entrained air, it is not as preferred that the stream be injected at about half the liquid depth. A valve <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> controls the flow of fluid in line <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the fluid pressure in lines <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> be substantially greater than the fluid pressure in tank. In addition, as mentioned above, both inlet <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and inlet <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are configured such that liquid entering tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has a velocity vector that is horiztonal and parallel to the tank wall at the point of entry. The momentum of this entering fluid is imparted to the fluid in the tank, with the result that circular flow is generated in tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Because of friction with the walls and floor, this in turn results in a toroidal flow pattern, in which liquid flows down along the walls, inward across the floor, upward in the center of the tank and outward at the liquid surface. The toroidal flow tends to sweep particles that have fallen to the tank floor toward the center of tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, where suction inlet <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> is located. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A bypass line <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> preferably connects pressurized feed line <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> to gas-entraining line <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> and liquid injection line <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>. Valve <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> preferably controls the flow of liquid through line <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. When valve <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is closed, liquid is shunted around filter system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> via bypass line <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. A control valve <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>, or check valve (not shown), or both, is preferably included on bypass line <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that not all water exiting tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> via pump discharge outlet <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> enters pump <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Rather, in some cases, such as when it is determined that the water at the tank bottom is sufficiently clean, the water may be allowed to flow through separation drain outlet <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and drain valve <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. Typically, the drain valves are not used during operation and are used onlyu to drain the vessels for maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Operation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Initially, FOG-containing liquid is poured into a sink or other drain. The liquid flows into a strainer, where the large particles (herein defined as &gt;2 mm) are removed. This strainer can be of the basket type, which requires manual removal and dumping, or an automatic type that continuously dumps the collected solids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Frothing </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> After the large solids are removed, the liquid and remaining solids are introduced into tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> as a toroidal stream. In one embodiment, pump draws liquid from the center of the tank and injects it tangentially to the tank wall, thereby enhancing toroidal flow. This in turn has the effect of lengthening the fluid flow path and increasing residence time. Chamber residence time can be estimated by measuring the distance the liquid must travel between the inlet and the outlet, determining the linear velocity at the inlet or outlet, then dividing the distance by the velocity. A long flow path allows more participation of the liquid within the tank; flow patterns in tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are preferably maintained such that the last liquid entering the tank is the last liquid out. Hence, a long flow path increases the residence time that the liquid stays within tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. By increasing the residence time, more time is allowed for gravitational separation to occur. This means that those particles that have a difference in specific gravity will either rise or sink within the liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> It is preferable for small bubbles to be educted into the liquid while it is circulating in tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. This is achieved by using a portion of pressurized liquid from pump <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> as a motive for eductor <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, which induces small air bubbles into the stream. The air is derived from vapor space in the top of the tank and is recycled from the tank to the eductor. This liquid/air mixture is then fed into tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, where it is circulated through the liquid in the tank (due to toroidal flow). All of the liquid will pass through the rising air bubbles many times before reaching the exit. After passing through the liquid, the air rises back to the vapor space in the top of the tank. As the tiny air bubbles rise through the liquid, they contact and adhere to some of the small solid particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Even though these small particles may be heavier than the liquid, they may attach to the bubbles and be carried to the top of the liquid. Oil separation is further enhanced because rising bubbles (1) cause small oil droplets to attach to them or (2) push the small oil droplets together, coalescing them into larger droplets. As these oil droplets continue to increase in size and density, their buoyancy or velocity rise rate will increase according to Stokes&apos; Law, shown by Equation 1. </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>F&equals;6&pgr;r&eegr;v&emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> where F is the force acting in resistance to the fall, r is the radius of the sphere, &eegr; is the viscosity of the liquid, and v is the velocity of fall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As the bubbles attach to solids and the small oil droplets coalesce into larger droplets, a froth composed of oil, solid particles and air forms and collects on the surface of the liquid. Once the froth has accumulated on the surface of the liquid, it is removed by the mop system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As described above, by making the liquid flow through a torturous path and at low velocity (herein defined as &lt;6 feet per second) before leaving tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, almost all of the small FOG droplets come in contact with corrugated separator plate <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. Once contact is made the droplets will attach, migrate upward into chevrons, coalesce and form into large enough drops to rise to the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Because the smallest droplets of oil are often not effectively removed by gravity separation, even when the separation is enhanced by gas sparging, the FOG content of the liquid leaving tank <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> via pipe <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> often exceeds environmental standards. To reduce the small droplets of oil, and the overall FOG content, a corrugated plate separator is used to collect the oil by attaching to the oil when the oil makes contact with its surface. As more and more of the droplets attach they will coalesce and form large enough drops to rise at a rate to overcome the downward velocity of the liquid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Separating </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> As mop <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> passes through the froth at the surface of the liquid, bubbles and solid and liquid particles of FOG and the like cling to its fibers and are lifted out of the liquid. This material is removed from the belt fibers by opposed rollers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, the material is squeezed out of the fibers <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> as shown at <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> and drops into a trough <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, from which it flows via pipe or trough <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> into a collection container (not shown). It is preferred to remove the froth soon after it forms because over time the air will break out of the froth, allowing heavy solids to sink. If desired, a blade or other mechanical device (not shown) can be used to facilitate the collection of the recovered material after it is squeezed out of the belt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> If desired, heat may be used to aid the separation process. Because heat is lost as the wastewater passes through piping and the skimmer basket into the separation tank, it is preferable to add heat to maintain a constant process temperature. This prevents solids and FOG from forming into large globules. Heat can be added by the use of one or more electric immersion heater elements placed in the liquid, such as element heating <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a heat exchange system, or other suitable heating mechanisms. By increasing or maintaining the temperature between 115&deg; F. and 130&deg; F., FOG will separate freely from those solids and rise to the top. At the same time, the solids will sink to the bottom. In order to prevent temperature loss and reduce the electric heating cost, piping and tanks should be insulated. This is important when the restaurant is not discharging hot water into the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Filtering </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, by increasing the time the liquid has between the inlet and the outlet, most of the particles will rise to the top or sink to the bottom. The toroidal stream creates a vortex that causes heavy particles that have sunk to the bottom of the tank to move to the center of the tank, where they can be removed by suction inlet <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> or outlet drain <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In order to remove the solids that have collected on or near the bottom of the separation tank, they are withdrawn and passed through a specially designed filter system for removal. This is done by placing the suction of the eductor pump near the center of the separation tank and placing the filter between the pump discharge and the eductor or tank return. Like the inlet strainer, this filter system needs to be emptied and cleaned periodically. The filter preferably removes particles down to the 10 micron range, thereby insuring that the total liquid quality exiting the separation tank will be within discharge specifications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Pump <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> pressurizes the liquid to a predetermined pressure that allows filtration, air eduction and force for producing the toroidal flow. Typical pressure is between 20 and 50 psig. The flow rate through pump <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is preferably at least two times the flow rate through inlet <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. For example, if the system has an inlet flow rate of 10 gpm, then the pump discharge should be at least 20 gpm. The discharge rate of pump <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is preferably greater than the flow through inlet <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> because the passage of water through filters <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> does nor result in complete removal of solids. Therefore, it is preferred to remove and clean at least two tank volumes for each new wastewater volume added. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, filtration unit <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> includes two inline pressure indicators <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, which indicate fluid pressure upstream and downstream of the filters, respectively. When valve <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> is closed, indicator <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> will indicate the pressure in pressurized feed line <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. When valve <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is closed, indicator <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> will indicate the pressure in gas-entraining line <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. By comparing the pressures at the two indicators, it is possible to determine when the pressure differential across the filters reaches a point where the filter elements need to be cleaned. Filter bypass line <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> may be used during the time the filters are being cleaned. Because this is such a short time and dilution would not be greatly affected, filtration system <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> does not need to be shut down. The filters are preferably cleaned when no wastewater is entering the system (e.g. when the restaurant is closed). </paragraph>
