<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to methods of synthesizing polymeric compounds, and more particularly, to methods of synthesizing polymeric compounds comprising polyethylene glycol moieties. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is used in a wide variety of applications including, but not limited to, plasticizers, softeners, humectants, ointments, polishes, paper coating, mold lubricants, bases for cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, solvents, binders, metal and rubber processing, and additives to foods and animal feed. Some particular uses of PEG in pharmaceutical applications include, for example, formation of PEG-drug conjugates, treatment of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, treatment of functional and/or chronic constipation, treatment of encopresis in children, and diagnosis and therapy of gastrointestinal diseases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> PEG is typically produced by base-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of ethylene oxide. The reaction is initiated by adding ethylene oxide to ethylene glycol, with potassium hydroxide as catalyst. This process results in a polydispersed mixture of polyethylene glycol polymers having a molecular weight within a given range of molecular weights. For example, PEG products offered by Sigma-Aldrich of Milwaukee, Wis. are provided in polydispersed mixtures such as PEG 400 (M<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>380-420); PEG 1,000 (M<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>950-1,050); PEG 1,500 (M<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>1,400-1,600); and PEG 2,000 (M<highlight><subscript>n </subscript></highlight>1,900-2,200). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In J. Milton Harris, <highlight><italic>Laboratory Synthesis of Polyethylene Glycol Derivatives, </italic></highlight>25(3) <highlight><italic>Rev. Macromol. Chem. Phys. </italic></highlight>325-373 (1985), the author discusses synthesis of monomethyl ethers of PEG (also known as methyl-terminated PEG or mPEG). The reference states that mPEG contains a significant amount (as much as 25%; from size exclusion chromatography) of PEG without the methoxy end group. This PEG &ldquo;impurity&rdquo; may result from water present in the polymerization process. Under basic conditions, hydroxide is produced, which yields PEG upon reaction with the ethylene oxide monomer. Since the hydroxide-initiated PEG chain can grow at both ends, while the methoxide-initiated chain can grow from only one end, the resulting mixture has a broader molecular weight distribution than that for the PEG&apos;s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While these polydispersed mixtures of PEGs and/or mPEGs may be useful for some applications, physical properties of polymers may vary with the length of the polymer. Thus, polydispersed mixtures may not be suitable for certain applications that require specific physical properties. Additionally, the heterogeneity of commercially available PEGs and mPEGs may complicate spectroscopic analysis, physico-chemical characterization and pharmacokinetics analysis. As a result, it is desirable to provide monodispersed mixtures of PEGs and/or mPEGs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Monodispersed mixtures of PEG and/or mPEG polymers may be provided by various organic synthesis routes. For example, in Yiyan Chen &amp; Gregory L. Baker, <highlight><italic>Synthesis and Properties of ABA Amphiphiles, </italic></highlight>64 <highlight><italic>J. Org. Chem. </italic></highlight>6870-6873 (1999), the authors propose the following scheme:

</chemistry-cwu>
</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> This synthesis route may be inconvenient due to the number of steps required as well as the use of undesirable reaction conditions such as high temperatures that may actually break down the PEG polymer. Moreover, it may be difficult to purify the product as the starting material may always be present in the reaction mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In G&eacute;rard Coudert et al., <highlight><italic>A Novel, Unequivocal Synthesis of Polyethylene Glycols, Synthetic Communications, </italic></highlight>16(1): 19-26 (1986), the authors proposed the following synthesis route:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This synthesis route may be inconvenient due to the undesirable reaction conditions, which do not lead to mPEG. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As a result, it is desirable to provide a new route for synthesizing PEG, mPEG, and/or polymers comprising a PEG moiety that are more efficient and do not require such undesirable reaction conditions. </paragraph>

The synthesis of a substantially monodispersed mixture of polyethylene glycol-containing oligomers begins by the preparation of the monobenzyl ether (XII) of a substantially monodispersed mixture of polyethylene glycol. An excess of a commercially available substantially monodispersed mixture of polyethylene glycol is reacted with benzyl chloride in the presence of aqueous sodium hydroxide as described by Coudert et al (<highlight><italic>Synthetic Communications, </italic></highlight>16(1): 19-26 (1986)). The sodium salt of XII is then prepared by the addition of NaH, and this sodium salt is allowed to react with the mesylate synthesized from the ester of a hydroxyalkanoic acid (XIII). The product (XIV) of the displacement of the mesylate is debenzylated via catalytic hydrogenation to obtain the alcohol (XV). The mesylate (XVI) of this alcohol may be prepared by addition of methanesulfonyl chloride and used as the electrophile in the reaction with the sodium salt of the monomethyl ether of a substantially monodispersed mixture of a polyethylene glycol derivative, thereby extending the polyethylene glycol portion of the oligomer to the desired length, obtaining the elongated ester (XVII). The ester may be hydrolyzed to the acid (XVIII) in aqueous base and transformed into the activated ester (XIX) by reaction with a carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide. While the oligomer illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is activated using N-hydroxysuccinimide, it is to be understood that various other reagents may be used to activate oligomers of the present invention including, but not limited to, active phenyl chloroformates such as para-nitrophenyl chloroformate, phenyl chloroformate, 3,4-phenyldichloroformate, and 3,4-phenyldichloroformate; tresylation; and acetal formation. </paragraph>

Non-polydispersed mesylate XXIV (0.50 g, 1.0 mmol) in 2.5 ml dry toluene was added. After stirring at room temperature over night, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 2 ml of methanol and the resultant solution was filtered through silica gel.
