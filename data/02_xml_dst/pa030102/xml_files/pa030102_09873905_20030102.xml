<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Chrysanthemum plant, botanically known as <highlight><italic>Dendranthema morifolium </italic></highlight>and herein after referred to by the cultivar name &lsquo;GEDI ONE MIS.&rsquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This new cultivar originated from hybridization of a female parent, cultivar &lsquo;Marenco&rsquo; (unpatented in the United States), and a male parent cultivar &lsquo;Bronia&rsquo; (unpatented in the United States). The new cultivar was discovered by the inventor in October 1996. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar by apical tip cutting and meristem tissue culture was performed in Oxnard, Calif. and has shown that the unique features of this new cultivar are stable and reproduced true to type on successive generations. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The cultivar &lsquo;GEDI ONE MIS&rsquo; has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature, daylength, and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of &lsquo;GEDI ONE MIS.&rsquo; These characteristics in combination distinguish &lsquo;GEDI ONE MIS&rsquo; as a new and distinct Chrysanthemum: 1. Decorative type inflorescence; 2. Consistent flowering response to short days, blooming consistently after <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> days of short day length; 3. Free branching habit; and 4. Compact growth habit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Plants of the new cultivar are similar to plants of the parent cultivar, &lsquo;Marenco,&rsquo; in most horticultural characteristics, however plants of the new cultivar differed from plants of the cultivar &lsquo;Marenco&rsquo; in the following characteristics: 1. The new cultivar naturally blooms 2 weeks earlier; 2. The new cultivar has blooms more uniformly; 3. The new cultivar has more blooms per flowering branch; and 4. The new cultivar has more ray florets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Plants of the new cultivar are also similar to plants of the parent cultivar, &lsquo;Bronia,&rsquo;in most horticultural characteristics, however plants of the new cultivar differed from plants of the cultivar &lsquo;Bronia&rsquo; in the following characteristics: 1. The new cultivar has different ray floret color; 2. The new cultivar has more blooms per flowering branch; and 3. The new cultivar has a wider diameter bloom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The new cultivar can be compared to the Chrysanthemum cultivar &lsquo;Jenny Wren&rsquo; (disclosed in Plant Patent No. 10,213). However plants of the new Chrysanthemum differed from the plants of the cultivar &lsquo;Jenny Wren&rsquo; in the following characteristics: 1. The new cultivar has more ray florets; 2. The new cultivar has a more round plant shape and greater branching; 3. The new cultivar has a shorter internode length; 4. The new cultivar has a more flexible plant form; and 5. The new cultivar has more blooms per flowering branch. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In the following description, color references are made to the Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used. The following observations and measurements describe plants grown in a commercial filed on Oxnard, Calif. in the month of September 2000. The growing conditions range from 60&deg; to 65&deg; F. at night to 70 &deg; to 85&deg; during the day. Measurements and numerical values represent averages of typical flowering types. The plant described was planted in mid-May and was grown in a twogallon container. The plant was pinched back 10 days after planting. Botanical classification: Dendranthema morifolium cultivar &lsquo;GEDI ONE MIS&rsquo; Commercial classification: Garden-type Chrysanthemum Parentage: Hybridization of female parent &lsquo;Marenco&rsquo; (unpatented in the United States) and male parent &lsquo;Bronia&rsquo; (unpatented in the United States) </paragraph>
