<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> There are many forms of personal transportation. Two major categories of personal transportation include transportation modes powered by a motor and transportation modes powered through efforts of man or beast. Individuals may use more that one form of personal transportation depending upon the distance to be traveled and the speed with which the desired distance must be covered and the transportation modes and infrastructure most prevalent and available in the country of travel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Generally, non-motor powered personal transportation, bicycles for example, is appropriate for short distances and slow to moderate speeds. Advantageously, bicycles are relatively small and lightweight and require minimal effort, cost, and space for storage when not in use. Powered transportation, a car for example, is appropriate for long distances and moderate to high speeds. Relative to bicycles however, cars are large, heavy and require relatively greater effort, cost, and space when not in use. There exists a middle ground where the distance and the speed of travel are moderate. In this middle case, a bicycle may not be desirable because of the physical effort required to propel the vehicle and a car is not desirable because of the inconvenience and cost of finding a space for storage after the rider has reached the destination. This middle ground is addressed to date with devices such as motorcycles and motor scooters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Motorcycles and motor scooters are smaller than cars and are powered by a motor so they can sustain higher speeds for a longer period of time than a non-powered bicycle. U.S. Pat. No. 3,513,926 issued to R. E. Paget, Jr. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,026,573 issued to Richardson disclose two-wheeled foldable transportation vehicles. Advantageously, the transportation vehicles disclosed are small and powered. Both vehicles, however, appear to be somewhat bulky and, while foldable, are not as lightweight and compact as may be desirable. An advantage of a compact and lightweight transportation vehicle is the possibility of using a transportation method that utilizes a combination of public transportation and personal transportation. If a personal transportation vehicle is lightweight and compact, a rider can take a personal transportation vehicle to a place where public transportation (i.e. bus, subway, train) is readily accessible, carry the personal transportation vehicle on the public transportation, and then ride the personal transportation vehicle to a final destination. Once there, a compact and lightweight personal transportation vehicle may be carried to an ultimate destination (i.e. office or apartment) obviating the need for availability of on street vehicle storage. As one of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate, such a device permits a door-to-door transportation method in a cost-effective and environmentally responsible way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There remains a need therefore, for a smaller and more lightweight personal transportation vehicle. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the drawings shows a personal transportation vehicle according to the teachings of the present invention in which a frame <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> has first and second axles <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, a seat <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, first and second wheels <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> mounted on respective ones of the first and second axles <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, a pivotable fork stem <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, and handlebars <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> connected to the fork stem <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> via head tube <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. The components <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> that are mentioned above and their relative attachment to each other may be that of a conventional bicycle frame without pedals as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A high rpm electric motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, such as a permanent magnet, ironless rotor, DC brush motor, drives the second wheel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> using a timing belt type drive. A small drive sprocket <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is attached to motor shaft. A large sprocket <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is attached to the second wheel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The large rear sprocket <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can be attached directly beside a wheel rim similar to the hand wheel on a wheel chair. This permits a large gear reduction of up to 20 to 1 or more. The rear sprocket must not be of larger diameter than the wheel rim to account for flat tires unless the sprocket can support the vehicle during such occurrences. Alternatively the rear sprocket <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can be integral to the second wheel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> or attached to spokes or the wheel hub. A cogged belt <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> links the two pulleys. A spring loaded tensioner <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> accounts for wheel dissymmetry and keeps a large number of cogs engaged in the small drive sprocket. This type drive provides high efficiency transfer from motor to wheels and is resistent to dirt and water problems. It can support regenerative braking whereby wheel momentum is driven back into the motor. An energy storage device <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, such as a metal hydride or lithium ion battery, runs the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for sustained travel. The motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is controlled by a throttle <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, an on/off switch, and a current limiter to give the rider <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> control and provide protection. The vehicle is also provided a means of braking independent of the motor as shown with the handbrake <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Alternate embodiments may use a combustion motor for power or any other type of power drive for the first or the second wheel <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The high rpm DC electric motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and lithium ion battery combination was chosen for the disclosed embodiment for its small size and weight and general commercial availability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment, the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has a footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> connected thereto that is perpendicular to a plane of the first wheel <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and extends on either side of the first wheel <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. With specific reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> of the drawings, there is shown a cross sectional view cut in a plane perpendicular to the first wheel <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> through the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown, the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is co-linear with the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and extends past where the fork stem <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> attaches to the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. With respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> of the drawings, a rider <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of a personal transportation vehicle according to the teachings of the present invention may place each foot <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> on the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> while the vehicle is in motion. A force transfer element (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, but shown and described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and later drawings) causes a force that is received by the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to be transferred to the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and first wheel <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The distance between the seat <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, which is matched to the rider&apos;s leg length, therefore, defines an appropriate size of the frame <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> for the rider <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. When the vehicle is stationary, one or both of the rider&apos;s feet <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> may be placed on the ground to keep the vehicle upright while the rider remains seated. The rider&apos;s feet and legs may also assist in acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle. Accordingly, the appropriate height of the seat <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for the rider <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> permits comfortable and solid placement of the rider&apos;s feet <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> on the road surface. Acceleration and deceleration assistance from the rider <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> permits use of a motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> smaller that one required without such assistance and adds an extra margin of safety for the rider <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The placement of the footrest in a &ldquo;feet forward&rdquo; body position advantageously provides a relatively short wheelbase relative to the rider&apos;s size for the personal transportation vehicle while maintaining a stable riding position. This further enhances the compact and lightweight nature of the vehicle. Additionally, the feet forward position provides for a feet first impact in the event of a collision thereby enhancing the safety of the vehicle. Furthermore, the upright body position enhances the rider&apos;s ability to see obstacles and other vehicles on the road also enhancing the safety of the rider <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> With specific reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> of the drawings, there is shown a cross sectional view of an embodiment of the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the force transfer element <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is co-linear with and connected to the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The force transfer element <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> comprises the mechanical connection between the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that causes a force placed on the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to be transferred to the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has a footrest hinge <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> that permits the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to be folded to a position in a plane that is parallel to a plane of the first wheel <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. A hinging sequence is illustrated in phantom view. Alternatively, the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be configured as a removable element. The hinging and removable features of the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> aid in the compact storage of the vehicle as will be described herein. In the extended position, the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> also comprises a force transfer element <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> which functions to receive a force from the rider&apos;s placement of their foot or feet <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> on the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and transfer the force to the fork stem <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and the frame <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> through the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> With specific reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> of the drawings, there is shown an alternate embodiment of a footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and force transfer element <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> according to the teachings of the present invention in which the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is not co-linear with the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, but extends perpendicular to the plane of the first wheel <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> from a position above the centerline of the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and on the fork stem <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be integral with the fork stem <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> or it may be attached to the front fork <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> in a way to permit removal and reattachment. In this embodiment, the force transfer element <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> transfers the force of the rider&apos;s weight from the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> through the fork stem <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> With specific reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> of the drawings, there is shown another embodiment of the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> according to the teachings of the present invention in which the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is an extension of the fork stem <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> below the centerline of the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the force transfer element <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> comprises a 90 degree curved tube connecting the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> With specific reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> of the drawings, there is shown another embodiment of the footrest according to the teachings of the present invention in which the fork stem <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> comprises a monofork <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is co-linear with the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, but due to the nature of a support structure associated with the monofork <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight>, each footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> has a different embodiment of a force transfer element <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. On a first side of the vehicle <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, a triangular stiffening strut <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> attaches to a length of the monofork <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> along a first side of the strut <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> and the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> along a second side of the strut <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. On a second side of the vehicle <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> of the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, the force transfer element <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and may be hinged or not. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> With specific reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> of the drawings, there is shown another embodiment of a vehicle and footrest configuration according to the teachings of the present invention in which a footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> stem connector <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> attaches to both the head tube <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and the front fork <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. The footrest stem connector <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> transfers a portion of a force placed on the handlebars <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> via a head tube link <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> to the head tube <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and front fork <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown, the first side of the vehicle <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> has a footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> comprising an extension of the footrest stem connector <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> perpendicular to the plane of the first wheel <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The force transfer element <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> comprises an elbow section integral with the footrest stem connector <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> that connects to the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment disclosed, the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> on the first side of the vehicle <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> is substantially co-linear with a centerline of the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, but is not attached thereto. Accordingly, a force placed on the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> on the first side of the vehicle <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> is transferred to the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through the fork stem connector <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> and fork stem <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> and not directly to the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. For purposes of disassembly of the vehicle, quick release connectors <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> attach the footrest stem connector <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> to the front fork <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. On a second side of the vehicle <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is co-linear with the first axle <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and is attached directly thereto as previously described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> of the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As one of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate, the purpose of the embodiments shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is illustrative and not exhaustive and shows a few of the various alternative embodiments for receiving a force placed on the footrest <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> by a rider <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and efficiently distributing the force to the axles and tires of the personal transportation vehicle while providing an advantageous body placement for the rider <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> on a compact vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With specific reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the drawings, there is shown a fold sequence for an embodiment of a personal transportation vehicle according to the teachings of the present invention in which a streamlined frame <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> is illustrated. The frame <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> comprises a hollowed structure having two identical and integral halves connected along their lengths. In the streamlined frame, the frame may cover the motor <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, energy storage device <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and pulleys (shown underneath the frame <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> in cutaway a view) thereby protecting the rider (not shown). The seat <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be configured as a cushioned portion of the frame <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> for rider comfort. In a foldable embodiment, the frame <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> is hinged at a frame hinge <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> at a position between the seat <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the head tube <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. With respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> of the drawings, the initiation of the fold sequence is begun by folding (or removal) of the footrests <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Next The first wheel <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is also rotated 180 degrees as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows the frame latch <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> unhooked so that the frame may be folded around the frame hinge <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> is then folded to the storage position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the handlebars are removed and compactly placed between the first and second wheels <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Folded as described, the vehicle may be placed in a carrying case <highlight><bold>1401</bold></highlight> slightly larger than a typical briefcase for storage or further travel by the rider on foot or public transportation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Although preferred embodiments of the invention are described, they are illustrative only and do not exhaustively describe all possible variants. Other embodiments and modifications of the invention are possible and are covered by the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
