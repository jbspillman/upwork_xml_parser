<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to compositions and methods for removing silver oxide and silver sulfide from surfaces. More particularly, the invention relates to compositions containing a reducing agent and an alkali source and methods of using such compositions by contacting an object to be cleaned with the composition. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Silver oxide, silver sulfide, and other silver by-products (&ldquo;silver soils&rdquo;) build-up, in photofinishing equipment. In modem photofinishing, an automated process uses at least three separate tanks and associated solutions: a developer tank containing the developer solution that reduces the silver in the latent image to metallic silver, a fixer tank containing a fixer solution to remove undeveloped silver halide salts, and a wash tank containing a wash bath to remove residual fixer. These tanks are connected by a mechanized conveyance system, such as rollers, belts, and/or racks, to carry the photographic material between the tanks. After use of such automated processors, silver soils accumulate on the equipment thereby affecting the processor performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> These silver soil deposits may contain silver, silver salts, silver oxide and silver sulfide. In the past, cerium solutions have been suggested, to clean silver soil U.S. Pat. No. 5,198,141. Various other solutions have also been used including bleach, chromic acid, sulfuric acid, and citric acid. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4,678,597; U.S. Pat. No. 4,640,713. These solutions may require several hours of soaking and manual scrubbing to effectively remove silver soil. As a result, the intricate equipment, such as the conveyance system and trays, is often disassembled and manually or ultrasonically cleaned. Disassembly methods are not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but they may lead to a host of mechanical problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Tarnish removers also remove silver soils in the form of tarnish, which is a film discoloration of a metal surface that is a result of a chemical reaction of oxygen and sulfur from the atmosphere with the metal surface. The prior art silver soil removers, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,691,593, typically use an abrasive material, a carrier and a surfactant. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A variety of cleaning agents may be used including, but not limited to, anionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, and zwitterionic surfactants. Anionic surfactants useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to carboxylates, sulfonates, sulfates, and phosphate esters. Example nonionic surfactants include those having a polyaklylene oxide polymer as a portion of the surfactant molecule. Such nonionic surfactants include halogen and alkyl polyethylene glycol ethers of fatty alcohols, polyalkylene oxide-free nonionics, carboxylic acid esters, carboxylic amides, silicone surfactants, and polyalkylene oxide block copolymers.

Desirably the surfactant is about 0.01% to about 0.05% wt., more desirably from about 0.01% to about 0.03% wt. of the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The cleaning composition may also include a minor but effective amount of a filler which enhances the overall cleaning capacity and/or cost effectiveness of the composition. Any suitable filler may be used, such as sodium sulfate, sodium chloride, starch, sugars, glycols and the like. Desirably, the filler is about 0%-30% wt., more desirably from about 0% to about 10% wt. of the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The present composition may also include low levels of an anti-corrosion agent to prevent damage to metal surfaces. Suitable anti-corrosion agents include water soluble metal ions, such as chlorides, nitrates and sulfates of magnesium and/or zinc ions; metasilicate, silicate, bismuth salts, manganese salts, paraffin, triazoles, pyrazoles, thiols, mercaptans, aluminum fatty acids, and mixtures thereof. If the alkalinity source is an alkali metal carbonate, bicarbonate or mixture, the anti-corrosion agent is preferably magnesium oxide and/or zinc oxide. To provide dispersibility of such metal ions in the composition, a carboxylated polymer, such as a water-soluble carboxylic acid polymer like polyacrylic and polymethacrylic acid or vinyl addition polymer like maleic anhydride copolymers, may be added. Desirably, the amount of this component is about 0% to about 10% wt. in the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A minor but effective amount of a defoaming agent may also be present in the composition, for reducing the stability of foam.

Desirably, the amount of this component is about 0% to about 5% wt. in the composition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Articles that may be cleaned with the present composition include metal surfaces, such as stainless steel, carbon steel, titanium and silver, as well as plastics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Other additives may be used depending on the desired final form of the composition. For example, thickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes and gels for application directly to the surface of the object to be cleaned. Similarly, a coating containing water-soluble polymeric materials and/or a hardening agent such as an amide, alkylamide, solid glycol, or starch may be employed if the final form is a tablet, pellet, block, or bead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Form/Delivery </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The composition may be in any form suitable for the desired delivery method. Example forms include a premixed composition wherein the reducing agent and alkaline source and/or other composition components are premixed with or without an aqueous solution such as to form a solid or liquid product. One or more of the components may also be mixed at the time of application to the object to be cleaned. As such, any of the components may be used in any form including solid beads, liquid, powdered, agglomerated, pelleted, or any combination thereof. The composition may be processed using conventional processing materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> One exemplary form is a premixed powder with an aluminum bar, rod or sheet. Another exemplary form is a mixture of solid aluminum and all other components in a liquid medium processed in a minor but effective amount of an aqueous medium, such as water, to substantially blend and solubilize these components and achieve a homogenous mixture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The amount of the composition used in the cleaning treatment will vary not only with the particular components selected but also with the route of delivery, the amount of silver soil to be removed, and the surface area of the silver soil. In general, however, a suitable dose will be in the range of from about 0.005% to about 1% wt. of the composition in the use solution. Theoretically, the composition&apos;s concentration is about 5 to 10,000 ppm in the use solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Composition Use </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The present composition is useful in silver soil removal applications, X-ray applications, photographic processing, silver processing and other imaging media. Therefore, objects to be cleaned may be composed of a variety of materials including metal such as silver, carbon steel, stainless steel, nickel, titanium, and copper, as well as plastic and rubber such as polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon, TEFLON, acrylonitrile butele styrene, polyvinyl chloride, EPDM, polycarbonate, polyurethane, polyacrylate, polystyrene, and polyester. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The composition may be used to remove silver soil from the surface of an object by applying the composition directly onto the object. Particularly suitable forms/delivery methods for such an application include gels or pastes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Another suitable method of using the composition includes immersing the object to be cleaned in a composition comprising a reducing agent such as elemental aluminum in zero oxidation state, an alkaline source, such as sodium carbonate such as water and an aqueous solution; and washing the object with an aqueous solution. In such an application, the alkaline source may be added to the aqueous solution before immersion of the object and the reducing agent may be added before or after immersion of the object. This method may be used as a clean-in-place cleaning regimen, where the solution is introduced into the equipment as assembled, or as a clean-out-of-place cleaning regimen, where the equipment is disassembled and inserted into basins containing the cleaning solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The reducing agent, alkaline source and any other composition components are added together with the accurate solution such that, the pH of the resulting solution stays within the alkaline range. The temperature of the resulting solution may be any suitable temperature including room temperature to about 80&deg; C. Higher temperatures speed the chemical reaction. Similarly, electricity may be conducted through the system to speed the chemical reaction; however, electricity is not necessary to allow the chemical reaction to proceed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The object to be cleaned may remain in contact with the composition for any amount of time as long as the removal of silver soil is effective. The amount of time will of course depend on the concentration of the composition, the route of delivery, the amount of silver soil to be removed, and the surface area of the silver soil. For example, the composition is in contact with the object for about 30 to 120 minutes, when the immersion technique is used </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Movement of the composition may be employed while it is in contact with the object. Suitable types of movement include scrubbing, agitation, air sparging, or effervesce. Such movements may speed the reaction by increasing the surface area of the silver soil and may also increase the effectiveness especially with respect to intricate parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> After contact with the composition, preferably the object is contacted with an aqueous solution, such as water. The object may be sprayed, immersed, wiped or have water applied in any known method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Experimental </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how the compounds, compositions, articles, devices, and/or methods claimed herein are made and evaluated, and are intended to be purely exemplary of the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers (e.g., amounts, temperature, etc.) but some errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, parts are parts by weight, temperature is in &deg; C. or is at ambient temperature, and pressure is at or near atmospheric.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A 1:1 wt mixture of sodium carbonate and 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid (HEDP) was prepared. This mixture was dissolved to obtain a 1.5% solution in luke warm water (about 50&deg; F.). A sheet of aluminum foil was laid at the bottom of the basin and the solution was added to the basin. A photoprocessing rack made from stainless steel and plastic with silver soil on the surface was inserted into the basin, such that a portion of the rack was not in contact with the solution. The rack remained in the solution for approximately two hours, upon which time it was removed and rinsed with water. Substantially all of the silver soil was easily removed from the rack with the water rinse and/or with slight mechanical action following the water rinse. Throughout this application, various publications are referenced. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains. </paragraph>
