<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to printheads, and more particularly to barrier/orifice structure designs for improved performance. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An exemplary application for the techniques disclosed herein is that of ink-jet printing. By way of example, thermal inkjet printers operate by expelling a small volume of ink through a plurality of small nozzles or orifices in a surface held in proximity to a medium upon which marks or printing is to be placed. These nozzles are arranged in a fashion in the surface such that the expulsion of a droplet of ink from a determined number of nozzles relative to a particular position of the medium results in the production of a portion of a desired character or image. Controlled repositioning of the substrate or the medium and another expulsion of ink droplets continues the production of more pixels of the desired character or image. Inks of selected colors may be coupled to individual arrangements of nozzles so that selected firing of the orifices can produce a multicolored image by the inkjet printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Expulsion of the ink droplet in a conventional thermal inkjet printer is a result of rapid thermal heating of the ink to a temperature which exceeds the boiling point of the ink solvent and creates a vapor phase bubble of ink. Rapid heating of the ink can be achieved by passing a square pulse of electric current through a resistor, typically for 0.5 to 5 microseconds. Each nozzle is coupled to a small unique ink firing chamber filled with ink and having the individually addressable heating element resistor thermally coupled to the ink. As the bubble nucleates and expands, it displaces a volume of ink which is forced out of the nozzle and deposited on the medium. The bubble then collapses and the displaced volume of ink is replenished from a larger ink reservoir by way of ink feed channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> After the deactivation of the heater resistor and the expulsion of ink from the firing chamber, ink flows back into the firing chamber to fill the volume vacated by the ink which was expelled. It is desirable to have the ink refill the chamber as quickly as possible, thereby enabling very rapid firing of the nozzles of the printhead. The ink flow into the chamber is through an entrance channel. </paragraph>

The printhead further includes printhead electronics that provide firing pulses to the drop generators such that no two drop generators in the same subgroup are activated simultaneously or preferably in sequence.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a perspective view of one type of inkjet print cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which may incorporate the printhead structures of the present invention. The print cartridge <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is the type that contains a substantial quantity of ink within its body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, but another suitable print cartridge may be a type that receives ink from an external ink supply either mounted on the printhead or connected to the printhead via a tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The ink is supplied to a printhead <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Printhead <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> channels the ink into ink ejection chambers, each chamber containing an ink ejection element. Electrical signals are provided to contacts <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to individually energize the ink ejection elements to eject a droplet of ink through an associated nozzle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The structure and operation of conventional print cartridges are very well known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary application, the invention relates to the printhead portion of a print cartridge, or a printhead that can be permanently installed in a printer, and, thus, is independent of the ink delivery system that provides ink to the printhead. The invention is also independent of the particular printer into which the printhead is incorporated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> While an exemplary application for this invention is in printing systems, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to printing systems, as it can find utility in non-printing applications as well, and particularly applications utilizing the ejecting of precisely controlled droplets of fluid, e.g. medical applications for ejecting droplets of medicine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of a portion of the printhead of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> taken along line <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A printhead typically has many nozzles, e.g. <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> or more nozzles and associated ink ejection chambers. Many printheads can be formed on a single silicon wafer and then separated from one another using conventional techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> silicon substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has formed on it various thin film layers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, sometimes hereinafter referred to as a &ldquo;membrane.&rdquo; The thin film layers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> include a resistive layer for forming resistors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Other thin film layers perform various functions, such as providing electrical insulation from the substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, providing a thermally conductive path from the heater resistor elements to the substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and providing electrical conductors to the resistor elements. One electrical conductor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is shown leading to one end of a resistor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A similar conductor leads to the other end of the resistor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In an actual embodiment, the resistors and conductors in a chamber would be obscured by overlying layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Ink feed holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are formed completely through the thin film layers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> An orifice layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is deposited over the surface of the thin film layers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and etched to form ink ejection chambers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, one chamber per resistor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Nozzles <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be formed by laser ablation using a mask and conventional photolithography techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The silicon substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is etched to form a trench <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> extending along the length of the row of ink feed holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so that ink <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> from an ink reservoir may enter the ink feed holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for supplying ink to the ink ejection chambers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment, each printhead is approximately one-half inch long and contains four offset rows of nozzles, each row containing 304 nozzles for a total of 1216 nozzles per printhead. The nozzles in each row have a pitch of 600 dpi, and the rows are staggered to provide a printing resolution, using both rows, of 2400 dpi. The printhead can thus print at a single pass resolution of 2400 dots per inch (dpi) along the direction of the nozzle rows or print at a greater resolution in multiple passes. Greater resolutions may also be printed along the scan direction of the printhead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In operation, an electrical signal is provided to heater resistor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which vaporizes a portion of the ink to form a bubble within an ink ejection chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The bubble propels an ink droplet through an associated nozzle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> onto a medium. The ink ejection chamber is then re-filled by capillary action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a perspective view of the underside of the printhead of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> showing trench <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and ink feed holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In the particular embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> single trench <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> provides access to two rows of ink feed holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the size of each ink feed hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is smaller than the size of a nozzle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> so that particles in the ink will be filtered by the ink feed holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and will not clog a nozzle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The clogging of an ink feed hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will have little effect on the refill speed of a chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> since there are multiple ink feed holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> supplying ink to each chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, there are more ink feed holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> than ink ejection chambers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view along line <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the individual thin film layers. In the particular embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the portion of the silicon substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown is about 10 microns thick. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A field oxide layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, having a thickness of 1.2 microns, is formed over silicon substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> using conventional techniques. A phosphosilicate glass (PSG) layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, having a thickness of 0.5 microns, is then applied over the layer of oxide <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A boron PSG or boron TEOS (BTEOS) layer may be used instead of layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> but etched in a manner similar to the etching of layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A resistive layer of, for example, tantalum aluminum (TaA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), having a thickness of 0.1 microns, is then formed over the PSG layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Other known resistive layers can also be used. The resistive layer, when etched, forms resistors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The PSG and oxide layers, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, provide electrical insulation between the resistors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, provide an etch stop when etching substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and provide a mechanical support for the overhang portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. The PSG and oxide layers also insulate polysilicon gates of transistors (not shown) used to couple energization signals to the resistors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In one type of printhead, it is difficult to perfectly align the backside mask (for forming trench <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>) with the ink feed holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Thus, the manufacturing process is designed to provide a variable overhang portion <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> rather than risk having the substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> interfere with the ink feed holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, but shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is a patterned metal layer, such as an aluminum-copper alloy, overlying the resistive layer for providing an electrical connection to the resistors. Traces are etched into the AlCu and TaA<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to define a first resistor dimension (e.g., a width). A second resistor dimension (e.g., a length) is defined by etching the AlCu layer to cause a resistive portion to be contacted by AlCu traces at two ends. This technique of forming resistors and electrical conductors is well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Over the resistors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and AlCu metal layer is formed a silicon nitride (Si<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>N<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>) layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, having a thickness of 0.5 microns. This layer provides insulation and passivation. Prior to the nitride layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> being deposited, the PSG layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is etched to pull back the PSG layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from the ink feed hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so as not to be in contact with any ink. This is important because the PSG layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is vulnerable to certain inks and the etchant used to form trench <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Etching back a layer to protect the layer from ink may also apply to the polysilicon and metal layers in the printhead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Over the nitride layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is formed a layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of silicon carbide (SiC), having a thickness of 0.25 microns, to provide additional insulation and passivation. The nitride layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and carbide layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> now protect the PSG layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from the ink and etchant. Other dielectric layers may be used instead of nitride and carbide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The carbide layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and nitride layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are etched to expose portions of the AlCu traces for contact to subsequently formed ground lines (out of the field of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> On top of the carbide layer <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is formed an adhesive layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of tantalum (Ta), having a thickness of 0.6 microns. The tantalum also functions as a bubble cavitation barrier over the resistor elements. This layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> contacts the AlCu conductive traces through the openings in the nitride/carbide layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Gold (not shown) is deposited over the tantalum layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and etched to form ground lines electrically connected to certain ones of the AlCu traces. Such conductors may be conventional. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> An advantage is that the ink feed holes can be formed by a thin film patterning process, providing the capability for forming small and very accurately placed feed holes. This is important for precisely tuning the hydraulic diameter of the feed holes as well as the distance from the feed holes to the associated resistors. In contrast, forming ink feed holes by etching through silicon is not as accurate. </paragraph>

In another embodiment, the trench etch is conducted before the orifice layer fabrication. In one embodiment, the orifice layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be fabricated using a spun-on epoxy called SU<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, marketed by Micro-Chem, Newton, Mass. Exemplary techniques for fabricating the barrier/orifice layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> using SU<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> or other polymers are described in U.S. Pat.

In another embodiment, the layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be formed of two separate layers, i.e. a barrier layer such as a dry film photoresist barrier layer, and a metal orifice layer, such as a nickel/gold orifice plate, formed on an outer surface of the barrier layer.

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the printhead of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is an exemplary printhead, but that the invention can be employed with other types of printheads, or using parameters or materials other than those described above regarding FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a schematic top view of a portion of a printhead, illustrating an aspect of the invention. According to this aspect of the invention, groups of drop generators, each with nozzles, (in this example, pairs of drop generators and nozzles) share ink paths, but are fluidically isolated on the top surface of the substrate from the rest of the drop generators in the column using the barrier/orifice material <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Thus, nozzles <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>B are grouped into a first sub-group, which share ink feed holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>B. Similarly, nozzles <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>D are grouped into a second sub-group, which share ink feed holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>D. The grouping is accomplished in an exemplary embodiment by forming a subsurface cavity in the barrier/orifice layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> adjacent the thin film layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so that the sidewall defining the cavity encompasses the grouped nozzles and shared ink feed holes. Thus, sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>B formed in the barrier layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has a perimeter which extends around the nozzles and ink feed holes of the first subgroup, and sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>C formed in the barrier layer has a perimeter which extends around the nozzles and ink feed holes of the second subgroup. </paragraph>

The nozzles of each sub-group are fluidically isolated from nozzles of the other sub-groups on the top of the substrate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, yet are commonly connected to the feed slot <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the bottom of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a simplified schematic diagram illustrating another aspect. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> diagrammatic top view of a portion of a printhead, shows a columnar group of drop generators formed on the substrate, with each drop generator comprising a nozzle and a resistor. In this simplified diagram, there are three drop generators <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>C, respectively comprising nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>A and resistor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>A, nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>B and resistor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>B, and nozzle <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>C and resistor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>C. For this aspect, the drop generators can be grouped into subgroups as described above regarding FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to provide fluidic isolation from other subgroups, or not grouped into subgroups, depending on the application. It will be seen that the drop generators in the columnar group are staggered with respect to a vertical axis, and have a varying distance from the inside edge <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>A of the ink feed slot formed in the substrate. Thus, for this example, drop generator <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>A is located furthest away from the inside edge <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>A, and drop generator <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>C is located the closest to the inside edge. These varying distances can create differences in ink flow from the corresponding ink feed openings to the respective drop generators. To help offset the varying distances, the ink feed holes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> associated with the respective drop generators has varying opening geometry. For the drop generator <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>A located the furthest distance from the inside edge of the ink feed slot, the ink feed hole has a relatively longer extent or length in a direction extending from the array axis <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> toward the drop generator. Correspondingly, the ink feed hole <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for drop generator <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>C has a relatively shorter length. Yet each of the ink feed holes have substantially the same hydraulic diameter to maintain a substantially constant fluidic pressure drop between the ink feed slot and the ink feed openings. The hydraulic diameter of an opening is defined as the ratio of the cross-sectional area of the opening to its wetted perimeter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a schematic of a representative embodiment of the architecture of the ink jet printhead <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> embodying aspects of this invention. Two drop generator or nozzle columns <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, with a pitch of 600 nozzles per inch (npi), are formed on the substrate by barrier structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the membrane of thin film layers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The membrane has a center axis <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, and the columns are arranged on opposite sides of the center axis. The printhead <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be utilized in a printing system with a scanning printhead carriage which is driven along a scan (Y) axis. The columns <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are offset relative to each other about the center axis to produce a 1200 npi array of nozzles. The printhead <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can also be used in other printing systems, e.g. in an essentially fixed, page-wide printhead configuration, wherein the print media is moved relative to the printhead to impart the relative motion between the printhead and the print media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Cross-talk refers to undesirable fluidic interactions between neighboring nozzles. Certain aspects of the architecture illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> make the avoidance of cross talk challenging. First, the fact that nozzles within a nozzle column are located on a high density pitch such as a 600 npi pitch places the nozzles in closer proximity than in many previous architectures. Associated with this is the fact that the higher nozzle density without a reduction in firing frequency goals creates a need for high ink flux rates and thus refill. Traditionally, the only neighbors considered from a crosstalk point of view are those nozzles that are located in adjacent positions within a nozzle column since nozzle columns are generally separated by sufficient distance that they do not interact fluidically. In the illustrated architecture, neighboring nozzles are found both within the nozzle columns as well as the column located on the opposite side of the feed slot or trench <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Consequently, cross talk reduction can be considered in two dimensions rather than just one dimension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> To address &ldquo;within column&rdquo; proximity, skip patterns are typically built into the fire sequence so that adjacent nozzles are not fired consecutively, thus maximizing the temporal separation of firings. In addition to this temporal improvement, fluidic isolation, usually in the form of peninsulas extending between adjacent nozzles, can be used to further reduce crosstalk. This cross talk reduction come at the cost of refill; it has been shown that there is substantial ink flow along the length of the die. As such, cross talk reduction features reduce the potential for lateral flow, and can potentially slow refill speeds, which will be particularly problematic for high nozzle density designs, e.g. 600 npi or greater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Thin film membranes are prone to cracking since they are very thin (on the order of 1-2 &mgr;m). Inherent stresses within the thin films, manufacturing stresses, or dropping of the printheads, can initiate cracking. Since the cracks, once formed, can propagate to electrically functional regions of the die, it is desirable that they be kept from forming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> It is also desirable that the printhead architectures be particle tolerant. Particle tolerant architectures (PTA) improve reliability by trapping contaminants while still allowing for ink flow into the firing chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The architecture of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> has a number of advantages. In one divergence from tradition, as generally described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, subgroups of drop generator nozzles share ink paths, but are isolated from the rest of the nozzles in the column using the cavities formed in the barrier/orifice material <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Thus, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, column <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprises a columnar array of drop generators <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>C, . . . <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>N, and column <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> comprises a columnar array of drop generators <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>C, . . . <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>N. Each drop generator includes a nozzle, a firing chamber and a firing resistor. Drop generators <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>B comprise respective nozzles <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>B and firing chambers <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>B, and, in accordance with an aspect of the invention, are arranged to form a subgroup of drop generator or nozzle subgroup, in this exemplary case, a pair. It is to be understood that, in other embodiments, the drop generators can be grouped in threes, fours or even larger subgroups. Moreover, it is not necessary that all the subgroups be of the same numbers of nozzles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The exemplary drop generator subgroup, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>B, is fed by an isolated ink feed path <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> having a path branch <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>A which feeds firing chamber <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>A, and a path branch <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>B which feeds firing chamber <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>B. The feed path for each subgroup in a column is fluidically isolated from the feed paths for the other drop generators in the column. A pair of ink feed holes <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>A feeds the first path branch <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>A, and a pair of ink feed holes <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>B feeds the second path branch <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>B. The ink feed path is defined by a cavity or opening formed in the barrier structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> having a sidewall perimeter <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and the ink feed holes formed in the thin film layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The barrier opening allows for &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; of the ink feed holes <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>B, while isolating the nozzle subgroup <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>B from the ink feed paths of the other nozzles in the column <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The grouping and ink path configuration are replicated, in this exemplary embodiment, for the other drop generator nozzles in the column <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and for the nozzle pairs in the second column <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Thus, drop generators <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>B of column <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> comprise respectively nozzles <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>B and firing chambers <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>B to form a drop generator or nozzle subgroup. The subgroup is fed by an ink feed path <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> having a path branch <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>A which feeds firing chamber <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>A, and a path branch <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>B which feeds firing chamber <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>B. A pair of ink feed holes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>A feeds the first path branch <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>A, and a pair of ink feed holes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>B feeds the second path branch <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>B. The ink feed path is defined by a cavity having a sidewall perimeter <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> formed in the barrier structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and the ink feed holes formed in the thin film layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The barrier opening allows for &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; of the ink feed holes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>B, while isolating the nozzle pair <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>B from the ink feed paths of the other nozzles in the column <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The barrier structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> further defines a center rib portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A dividing the two columns of nozzles <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, providing fluidic column isolation and thin film membrane support. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates in a simplified diagrammatic cross-sectional view the center rib portion <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A of the barrier structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and exemplary ink feed holes <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>B formed through the thin film structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to provide fluid communication with the ink feed slot or trench <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Exemplary nozzles <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>A are shown on opposite sides of the center rib portion, above the respective firing chambers <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The connection of nozzle ink feed paths provides refill and particle tolerance benefits that would not be realized if singulated nozzles, the ultimate in cross talk reduction, were used. In this exemplary embodiment, the printhead electrical layout is designed such that the printhead is not allowed to fire adjacent nozzles simultaneously. Typically, the nozzle firing order is determined by the on-die drive circuitry. In some thermal ink-jet applications, the die circuitry is designed such that the firing order is programmable. In other applications, the firing order is &ldquo;hardwired&rdquo; in the design of the on-die circuitry. In either case, the physical layout of the firing resistors is staggered in the scan axis, to enable vertical line straightness during printing. Alternatively, the printer driver or controller can be configured so as to not allow adjacent nozzles to be fired simultaneously. Since any nozzle is refilling only a small percentage of the time, ink fill holes associated with an isolated firing chamber are only providing ink flux a small percentage of time, and thus are not operating at peak efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> When nozzle ink feed paths are connected fluidically, a nozzle can refill using ink drawn through the ink feed holes associated with connected nozzles allowing the ink feed holes to be utilized more efficiently and increase refill speeds. This feature is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, which schematically illustrates nozzle pair <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>B with connected ink feed paths <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>B. When nozzle <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>A is fired, ink flows from ink fill holes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>A to the firing chamber <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>A, as shown by arrows <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>A, and also from the second ink fill hole <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>B as shown by arrow <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>B. When nozzle <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>B is fired, ink flows from ink fill holes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>B to the firing chamber <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>B, as shown by arrows <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>A, and also from the first ink fill hole <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>A as shown by arrow <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Additional benefit comes from the fact that the use of connected nozzles provides a degree of particle tolerance; in the case that the ink feed holes associated with a particular nozzle become blocked, refill can be sustained or supplemented by pulling ink from neighboring ink feed holes, allowing the nozzle to continue operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Another feature is the use of a continuous barrier/orifice material feature, provided by rib <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A in this embodiment, down the center axis <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of the membrane that has the effect of fluidically isolating nozzles on opposite sides of the axis. Beyond fluidic isolation, this center rib feature has the benefit that the continuous span of barrier/orifice material adds strength and stiffness to the membrane comprising the thin film structure <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the barrier/orifice layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, thereby increasing its robustness to cracking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The architecture of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> can provide several benefits from a manufacturing point of view. During an exemplary barrier/orifice material develop process for a barrier/orifice structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> fabricated using a polymer material such as SU<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, un-crosslinked barrier/orifice material is removed by a developer fluid with all flow passing through the nozzle bores. As such, processing is simplified by reducing the volume of un-crosslinked barrier/orifice material. Beyond the benefit realized through the reduced volume, there is a configurational benefit as well. Since the developing fluid for the example of the SU<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> material is spun on, designs in which all nozzles are connected fluidically allow the developer fluid to flow along the length of the die. This has the effect of allowing the fluid to flow easily to the edges of individual die as well as the edges of the wafer. This has the consequence of increasing the variability of barrier/orifice material features both within a die and across a wafer. By breaking the continuity of nozzle connections along the length of the die, this source of variability is reduced. The manufacturing yield during this exemplary processing to form the barrier/orifice structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be improved by creating singulated subsets of nozzles. When the firing chambers are all connected, it is more difficult to effectively wash out residue of the material forming the layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from the nozzles that are at the ends of the die. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of configuring the nozzles of a column in sub-groups is that of cross talk reduction. Since the only connection between non-grouped nozzles outside a particular grouping is through the ink reservoir, the potential for fluidic interaction with nozzles outside a particular grouping is minimized. Cross talk between nozzles in any particular grouping is minimized by the fact that the skip firing pattern used creates a situation in which nozzles within a subgroup never fire sequentially. The skip firing pattern is described with respect to the schematic printhead diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Skip patterns are typically built into the fire sequence so that the nozzles within a primitive are not fired consecutively, i.e. to distribute firing within a primitive temporally. In this embodiment, pairs of nozzles are isolated using the barrier/orifice material as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Since the skip pattern is determined a priori, the pairing of resistors is done in a manner that ensures there will be an barrier structure separating consecutively firing chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A primitive is a group of nozzles in a given column. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates a primitive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprising eight nozzles <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>H, with a corresponding firing sequence <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The connection of ink feed paths can be optimized beyond the embodiment shown by selecting the number of connected chambers as a function of the stagger pattern. In a &ldquo;no skip&rdquo; configuration, i.e. wherein the firing order within a primitive is consecutive (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and adjacent nozzles fire consecutively, an isolated chamber is desirable since immediate neighbors fire sequentially and need fluidic isolation. In a &ldquo;skip 1&rdquo; pattern, e.g. a firing order within the primitive of <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, immediate neighbors never fire sequentially. Thus the temporal isolation of the nozzles allows for the connection of nozzle ink feed paths in pairs; since firings of the connected nozzles are separated in time, the potential for cross talk to cause problems is reduced, and the refill and particle tolerance advantages of connected ink feed paths can be captured. By extension of the same principle, refill performance and particle tolerance can be maximized for a design by connecting the ink feed paths of as many nozzles as possible without connecting nozzles that fire sequentially. For the uniform skip patterns typically used: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the firing order of nozzles within a primitive <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is illustrated. This design utilizes a skip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> firing pattern. The skip pattern is determined by the electrical layout of the printhead in this embodiment, and so cannot be solely determined by inspection of the barrier/orifice structure. The paired nozzle never fires sequentially with its nozzle pair. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> also demonstrates the opportunity of connecting nozzles on the substrate in groups of 3 without loss of temporal separation, wherein group <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>A comprises nozzles <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>C, group <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>B comprises nozzles <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>D, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>E, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>F, and group <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>C comprises nozzles <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>G, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>H, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>I. For configurations with a non-uniform skip pattern, the same principle, that of fluidically isolating sequentially firing nozzles while maximizing sharing of ink feed paths, holds but will be complicated by the fact that in some locations it will be necessary to reduce the number of nozzles sharing ink feed paths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a highly simplified schematic diagram illustrating a printing system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> which can employ one or more of the printheads <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> embodying aspects of the invention. The system includes a carriage drive <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> for driving a carriage along a carriage scan axis. The carriage has mounted therein the printhead(s) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A media drive system <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> positions a print medium relative to a print zone, and can drive the print medium from an input media source to a media output location or tray. A print job source <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, typically external to the printing system, provides job data for printing jobs. A controller <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is responsive to the print job source and controls the carriage drive and media drive system to print the print jobs. The controller also provides firing signals to the printhead(s) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to control operation of the printhead(s). The printhead <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally includes a printhead electronics <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A responsive to the firing signals from the controller to energize the drop generator resistors comprising the drop generators <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>B. A fluid source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>C provides fluid, e.g. liquid ink, to the drop generators. The fluid source can be a fluid reservoir contained within the printhead <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> housing. An external fluid supply <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> can optionally be provided to replenish the fluid supply <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>C through fluid path <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, which can be a fluid conduit connected to the printhead during printing operations, or an intermittent connection used only during refill operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the printhead electronics <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A and the controller <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> together provide the skip firing pattern, and in more typical embodiments, the on-board printhead electronics are configured to provide the skip firing patterns. The printhead electronics <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>A is adapted in this exemplary embodiment to implement the skip firing pattern to ensure that firing pulses are provided to the drop generators such that the drop generators in a columnar group (i.e. primitive) are activated one at a time, and such that no two drop generators in the same subgroup, e.g. pair, are activated in sequence. Printhead electronics suitable or readily adaptable for the purpose are described, for example, in pending application Ser. No. 09/798,330, PROGRAMMABLE NOZZLE FIRING ORDER FOR INKJET PRINTHEAD ASSEMBLY, Schloeman et al., filed Mar. 2, 2001; pending application Ser. No. 09/253,377, Barbou et al., SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONTROLLING FIRING OPERATIONS OF AN INKJET PRINTHEAD, filed Feb. 19, 1999; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,648,806; and 5,648,805. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The architecture of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> enables &lsquo;smart&rsquo; nozzle cross-talk elimination by combining skip patterns with design of the barrier/orifice layer structure. The architecture provides increased tolerance to blockage of ink feed holes by allowing shared usage. Further, the architecture enables improved manufacturing yields due to membrane stiffening that is provided by the configuration of the barrier/orifice structure. Moreover, the architecture can enable more consistency of features of the barrier/orifice structure within a die and across a wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Nozzles within a primitive are staggered in the scan (Y) axis to improved vertical line straightness, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. To promote uniform refill rates for all the chambers in a staggered design, the distance from the leading edge of the ink feed holes to the center of the firing resistor, the cross-sectional area of the ink feed holes, and the wetted perimeter of the ink feed holes should be held as constants for all the firing chambers on the printhead. Distance D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) illustrates this distance from the leading edge of an ink feed hole <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>A to the center of the firing chamber for nozzle <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In addition, for improved manufacturability and yield, it is desirable to extend the back edge of the ink feed holes towards the center line <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of the membrane. Further, to ensure the resistor thin films are not &ldquo;undercut&rdquo; during the etching of the trench, a spacing D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), say 20 &mgr;m in this exemplary embodiment, is maintained between the edge of the inner most resistor and the outer most ink feed hole. If the thin films <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> were to be undercut, there would not be silicon under the resistors and the resistors would be prone to overheating. Further, to improve manufacturability, it is desirable to maintain a distance D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) of approximately 80 &mgr;m or greater from the leading edge of the outermost ink feed hole to the leading edge of the outermost ink feed hole on the opposing side of the membrane (i.e., membrane width). These design objectives can all achieved in the exemplary embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, which implements a distance D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of 76.1 &mgr;m. The minimum distance D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of 80 &mgr;m is chosen for exemplary embodiments in consideration of manufacturability and yield. A typical trench etch process to form the ink feed slot is inherently difficult to control with great precision. A higher minimum distance D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, e.g. 80 &mgr;m, provides more margin. Lowering the nominal minimum distance would make the target trench break through opening more difficult to achieve, and if the trench is significantly over-etched, then there may not be any silicon left under the thin film layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> While thin film membranes are prone to cracking, narrow membranes provide margin against cracking. Tests have shown that membranes of widths under &tilde;100 &mgr;m are more reliable than membranes of widths of &tilde;400 &mgr;m. An exemplary width of the membrane shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is approximately 76 &mgr;m. In addition, the barrier rib <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>A that runs down the center of the membrane adds strength to the fragile membrane, thereby increasing its robustness to cracking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The barrier/orifice structure <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the thin film layers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are designed such that the multiple ink paths can be created through the thin films <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the barrier/orifice layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for each drop generator. For the exemplary embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, there are two ink feed holes per firing chamber. In addition, if both of these holes become plugged by contaminants, ink could feed into the firing chamber through neighboring ink feed holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The printhead of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> can be designed to enable uniform refill rates for staggered, high nozzle packing density designs. This can be accomplished by feed hole cross-sectional area, ink feed hole wetted perimeter, and ink path length parameters which are nominally held as constants for all the firing chambers. These parameters are all shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. For example, the cross-sectional area of feed hole <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>A is the area A within the wetted perimeter <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, defined by the wall of the feed hole. The cross-sectional area of feed hole <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>B is the area B within the wetted perimeter <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, defined by the wall of the feed hole. The area A is equal to the area B, and the length of the entire wetted perimeter <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>A<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is equal to the length of the entire wetted perimeter <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the distance of the inner edge of both feed holes to the center of the respective firing chambers is equal, i.e. D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The printhead architecture can enable high nozzle packing density printheads, which translate to a lower cost/nozzle. Moreover, the printhead architecture enables two levels of particle tolerance, i.e. from the use of multiple ink feed holes per firing chamber, and from singulated groupings of drop generators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> A plurality of thin film membranes can be formed on a single die, with nozzle columns on the respective membranes are offset to produce very high nozzle densities. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a schematic illustration of an alternate printhead architecture of a printhead <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with two membranes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and four nozzle columns <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> to enable a 2400 npi array of nozzles. Thus, nozzle columns <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> are formed on membrane <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and nozzle columns <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> are formed on membrane <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates only one nozzle primitive for each column, and so it will be understood that each column will comprise additional nozzle primitives. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is not to scale, but is illustrative of how the four columns are staggered relative to each other and how a skip pattern works. Each column has a width dimension (along the Y axis) of {fraction (1/1200)} inch in this embodiment, and each primitive has eight staggered nozzles. For example, primitive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (column <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>) has even numbered nozzles <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, with the Y axis positions of the nozzles within the column staggered as illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The two membranes <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are situated about the center axis <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of the substrate for the printhead, and each is fed with ink through a trench formed in the substrate. Membrane <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is fed by a trench having a center along line <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and membrane <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is fed by a trench having a center along line <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. For this embodiment, the distance (D<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) from the center of the die <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to the centers of each trench (<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>) is 950 &mgr;m. Moreover, the column spacing on each membrane is 169.3 &mgr;m. These dimensions of course are for a particular implementation, and will vary depending on application specific parameters and design choices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Each cell has a dimension in the vertical (X) axis of {fraction (1/2400)} inch; the cells in the horizontal (Y) axis are not to scale. Also note that the nozzles of column <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> are offset in the X axis by {fraction (1/1200)} inch relative to the nozzles of column <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, on membrane <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Similarly the nozzles of column <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> are offset by {fraction (1/1200)} inch in the X axis relative to the nozzles of column <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>, on membrane <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Further, the nozzles of column <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> are offset in the X direction by {fraction (1/2400)} inch from the nozzles of column <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. Thus, the primitive stagger pattern in the X direction produces a nozzle spacing of all nozzles in the four columns of {fraction (1/2400)} npi. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In a typical application, the printhead can be mounted on a carriage driven along a scan (Y) axis. The nozzles in each primitive are staggered along the Y axis. The nozzles in each primitive are fired with a skip pattern, as discussed above. For example, a skip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> pattern can be employed. For a skip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> pattern, nozzle <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is fired, nozzles <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are skipped, nozzle <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is fired, nozzles <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are skipped, nozzle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is fired, nozzles <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are skipped, nozzle <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is fired, nozzles <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are skipped, nozzle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fired, nozzles <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are skipped, nozzle <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is fired, nozzles <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are skipped, nozzle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is fired, nozzles <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are skipped, and nozzle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fired. The skip <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> firing order for primitive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The subgrouping of nozzles within a column as described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, and the considerations of distance from the feed holes to the center of resistors and effective hydraulic diameters of the feed holes, described above with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, can be applied to the architecture of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, facilitating a printhead with a very high nozzle packing density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> While the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 13</cross-reference> have employed columnar groups (primitives) in which the printhead electronics fire only one nozzle within each group at a time, aspects of the invention can also be employed in applications where some or all of the nozzles in a given primitive are fired simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> It is understood that the above-described embodiments are merely illustrative of the possible specific embodiments which may represent principles of the present invention. Other arrangements may readily be devised in accordance with these principles by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. </paragraph>
