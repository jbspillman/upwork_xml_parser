<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention is a method and a device for adding a bonus prize component to wagering games such as those played in gambling casinos. A player obtaining a predetermined combination in the underlying game wins the bonus prize. This might be a predetermined combination of playing cards in a card game or a predetermined combination on the reels of a slot machine. The bonus prize may require a separate side wager to qualify. The bonus prize is randomly chosen from a group of bonus prizes that includes an incrementing jackpot. The device for practicing the method includes a prize wheel that is spun to randomly choose the bonus prize, and an incrementing device with attached jackpot display for generating and showing the current amount of the incrementing jackpot. Upon winning the incrementing jackpot, the incrementing stops and the player wins the current amount shown on the display. The incrementing jackpot is subsequently reset and the incrementing resumed. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to devices and methods for awarding a bonus prize based on wagering on a primary wagering game or from side wagering on the bonus prize. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Mechanical Gaming Devices </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Gaming devices allow players to play games. A large variety of such gaming devices have been developed over the years, particularly of the mechanical variety and more recently of the electromechanical variety. Reel-type slot machines are one well-known variety of gaming devices that utilize a plurality of cylindrical reels with various indicia around the outer surface of each reel, such as fruit or bells. Coins are inserted into the slot machine. Wagers are placed using buttons located on the front of the slot machine. The reels are spun by players pulling a lever at the side of the slot machine or by pushing a button located at the front of the slot machine. The stopping of the reels is random, the spinning and stopping being controlled by a reel spinning and sensing device in the slot machine. Payouts are based on obtaining particular predetermined combinations of indicia displayed on the reels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Card games such as blackjack and five-card stud are played using conventional playing cards displaying various standard indicia. In casinos, card games are played on gaming devices that are semi-circular card tables. The dealer stands behind the flat side of the card table and the players sit on stools along the circular side. The tabletop includes a felt cover having appropriate areas marked for placing wagers and for placing playing cards. Holders for holding chips can be affixed to the tabletop. This is a card game of the &ldquo;live&rdquo; type wherein the dealer physically controls play of the card game including wagering, the dealing of playing cards, and the payoff on wagers won by players. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Virtual Gaming Devices </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> During the last ten or so years, virtual gaming devices have been developed. An example of a virtual gaming device is video slot machines. Video slot machines have a video screen that displays a video image of virtual reels. An electronic controller within the slot machine controls the action of the virtual reels. Wagers are placed using buttons located on the front of the slot machine. The virtual reels are &ldquo;spun&rdquo; by the player pulling a lever at the side of the slot machine or by pushing a button located at the front of the slot machine. The electronic controller &ldquo;spins&rdquo; and stops each reel in a randomly chosen position similar to electromechanical slot machines. Payouts are based on obtaining particular predefined combinations of indicia displayed on the reels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Virtual gaming devices also include video gaming devices for playing card games. Video card games are played on video card machines having a video screen for displaying virtual versions of conventional playing cards. Such card games include blackjack, twenty-one, and five-card stud, though typically for only a single player to play at a time. Coins are inserted into the video card machine and wagers are placed using buttons on the front of the video card machine. Virtual playing cards are dealt using buttons located on the front of the video card machine. The virtual playing cards are dealt from one or more decks of virtual cards and are displayed on the video screen. An electronic controller randomly chooses the virtual playing cards similar to the &ldquo;live&rdquo; version played with conventional playing cards. The players, using buttons located on the front of the video card machine, make hits and other actions necessary for play. Payouts are based on obtaining particular predetermined combinations of virtual playing cards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A problem with gaming devices is that player enjoyment and excitement tends to wane over time unless their interest can be maintained. This is because playing the game &ldquo;gets old&rdquo; after awhile and players seek excitement at another gaming device or leave the gaming establishment such as a gambling casino. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Bonus Prizes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Since the players of the various casino games prefer games that maintain their interest and that provide excitement, and the casinos want to maximize their daily cash returns from each gaming device, it is desirable to both the players and to the casino to make games as interesting and exciting as possible. The maintained interest level and excitement provides more enjoyment for the players so they continue wagering longer, resulting in higher cash returns for the casino. Heightened awareness of gaming devices by posting potential payouts and by word-of-mouth also attracts more players who tend to play longer. The result is even greater commercial success for the gaming device. Therefore, in an effort to increase player interest and excitement, some gaming devices award bonus prizes in addition to the prizes that are awarded in the underlying or primary game when a predefined event occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Random Bonus Prizes </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In many casino gaming devices, the bonus prize depends on a randomly generated event. An example of such a bonus game in a gaming device can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,848,932 issued to Adams. One of the gaming devices described in this document comprises three reels and a prize wheel. When predetermined indicia are displayed on the reels of the primary game such as slots, the prize wheel can be activated to indicate a randomly selected bonus prize. The bonus prize is awarded in addition to any prizes awarded in the primary game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Another example of a gaming device that includes a randomly generated bonus prize is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,707,285 issued to Place et al. The wagering gaming device and method described in this document is for randomly selecting bonus prizes for games such as blackjack, poker, and electronic games. The device uses a computer that generates a random generated number that is compared to a predefined pay table to determine the bonus prize. The bonus prize depends on which range of predefined numbers the random number falls within. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Jackpots </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> One form of bonus prize is a jackpot. This is an amount of money that can be won by players of a particular casino game or group of casino games. Jackpots are very effective in raising the excitement and enjoyment experienced by the players. Many people like to win money so they can buy whatever they want rather than receiving a predetermined non-money bonus prize that they might not need or want. A large jackpot attracts more players to the wagering games and gaming devices and encourages players to play longer. Ideally, the amount of the jackpot is prominently shown on a lighted display adjacent the gaming devices on which the jackpot can be won. All such jackpots known to date in the gaming industry are of one of three types, fixed jackpots, incrementing jackpots, or random jackpots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Fixed Jackpots: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A fixed jackpot is a predetermined amount of money that does not change based on the passage of time nor based on the amount of wagers placed on the primary game with which it is associated. The level of player interest and excitement for fixed jackpots primarily depends on the amount of the fixed jackpot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Incrementing Jackpots: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> An incrementing jackpot is an amount of money that starts at a lower predetermined amount, the minimum jackpot, and incrementally increases based on a predetermined scheme. The incrementing of the jackpot stops at an upper predetermined amount of money, the maximum jackpot. There are two types of incrementing jackpots depending on the incrementing scheme used, those that are time-based, and those that are progressive. Those that are time-based increase by a fixed amount of money at fixed time intervals. Conversely, those that are progressive increase over time proportionate to the amount of the wagers placed on the primary game with which the jackpot is associated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Both types of incrementing jackpots can do one of two things upon reaching the maximum jackpot. The jackpot can hold at the maximum jackpot for a period of time such as the remainder of the week or until won. Alternatively, the jackpot can continue to move by scrolling. Scrolling can take two forms, the first form being to always increment the jackpot upwardly. When the maximum jackpot is reached, the jackpot jumps completely back to the lower jackpot to begin upwardly incrementing again. The second form of scrolling is to increment the jackpot both upwardly and downwardly. When the maximum jackpot is reached, the jackpot increments downwardly back to the lower jackpot, to begin upwardly incrementing again in a continuous manner until won. The level of player interest and excitement for incrementing jackpots primarily depends on the current amount of the jackpot and the speed at which the jackpot is upwardly incrementing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Random Jackpots: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A random jackpot is an amount of money that can be won based on a predefined table of possible individual amounts of money to win. The actual amount of money won in the random jackpot is not determined until the time the random jackpot is won. This may be accomplished in a similar manner to that for random bonus prizes wherein each possible individual amount of money is assigned a predefined range of numbers in a table. The larger the individual amount of money, the narrower the range of numbers assigned so as to decrease the odds of winning that jackpot. The smaller the individual amount of money, the larger the range of numbers assigned so as to increase the odds of winning that jackpot. Therefore, a greater number of smaller jackpots are won than larger jackpots. The level of player interest and excitement for random jackpots depends primarily on the amount of the jackpots and the probability of winning each jackpot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A problem with such individual fixed jackpots, incrementing jackpots, and random jackpots is that they too, over time, become less interesting and exciting to players. The only effective way to increase player interest and excitement is to increase the amounts of the jackpots, which places a heavier financial burden on the casino and reduces casino profits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Bonus Prizes in Card Games </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Bonus prizes have been added to card games of the &ldquo;live&rdquo; type having a person dealing conventional playing cards at a casino table. One example is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,077 issued to Jones in which a progressive jackpot is included as a bonus component of the card game twenty-one. The players place their wager on the primary game of twenty-one. Additionally, each player has the option of making a side wager that makes the player eligible to win the progressive jackpot. If a player&apos;s twenty-one hand comprises one of a predefined arrangement of cards, then that player wins the entire amount showing on the progressive jackpot. If multiple players&apos; twenty-one hands comprise one of the predefined arrangements of cards, then they share the progressive jackpot. The predefined arrangements of cards that constitute winning hands for the progressive jackpot component of the twenty-one game are chosen so as not to affect the strategy of play in the primary twenty-one game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Other examples of including a bonus prize component into card games of the &ldquo;live&rdquo; type are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5, 794,964; 5,913,726; and 5,795,225 issued to Jones et al. The players first place their wagers on the primary card game. Each player then has the option of making a side wager that makes the player eligible to win part or all of a progressive jackpot. The side wagers are placed by depositing one or more gaming tokens into a slot of a device provided to receive the gaming tokens. The device increments a jackpot meter that displays the amount of the progressive jackpot based on the total number of gaming tokens deposited. If during play of that hand a player is dealt a predetermined combination of cards, that player wins a pre-selected percentage of the progressive jackpot based on a predefined table of paybacks for the particular predefined combination of cards. Unwon amounts of the jackpot carry over to the next hand. The device automatically decrements the jackpot meter whenever a winning hand is paid and resets the device for the next hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Yet another example of including a bonus prize component into card games of the &ldquo;live&rdquo; type is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,743,800 issued to Huard et al. Players place a side wager to qualify for the bonus prize component. A device then randomly chooses a winning card or combination of cards along with a person or persons eligible to win the bonus prize upon subsequent possession of the chosen card or combination of cards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Bonus Prizes in Slots </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Bonus prizes have also been added to slot machines. One example in an electro-mechanical slot machine is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,004,207 issued to Wilson, Jr. et al. The slot machine provides a payout on wins, which payout is multiplied by an incrementing multiplier when special indicia on a reel are also present on the payoff line. A counter is incremented each time another special indicia appears anywhere on the visible portions of the reels. The counter increases the value of the multiplier upon reaching a predetermined value. When a multiplied payout occurs, the multiplier is reset to a minimum value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Networked Gaming Devices </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> One effort to increase player interest and excitement has been to connect multiple gaming devices in a network that awards a common bonus prize such as a jackpot. One example is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,941,773 issued to Harlick comprising a mystery jackpot controller. The controller connects to a plurality of electronic gaming devices that are networked together. Each of the gaming devices is provided with a network interface that signals the jackpot controller through the network on the occurrence of a predetermined operation of each gaming device. The jackpot controller generates and awards a bonus prize of a random jackpot on the receiving of a signal indicating the occurrence of one of the predetermined operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Prize Wheels </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Prize wheels have been used as a way of increasing player interest and excitement. A prize wheel is divided into pie-shaped segments indicating various bonus prizes. The prize wheel is manually or automatically spun and comes to rest with a fixed pointer indicating which segment contains the bonus prize won. Virtual versions of prize wheels displayed on a video screen can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> One example of including a bonus prize component using a prize wheel in a traditional card game of the &ldquo;live&rdquo; type is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,911,418 issued to Adams. The bonus game provides the players the opportunity to obtain a bonus prize by matching certain predefined hands resulting from the primary card game. A match permits the winning player or players to spin a prize wheel that is divided into a plurality of pie-shaped segments. Each segment indicates a prize such as doubling the winnings from the primary card game, or a second spin of the prize wheel. The winning player wins whatever is indicated by the particular segment that stops at a fixed indicator adjacent to the prize wheel. Players may be required to place a side wager to qualify for the bonus prize. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> There is a continuing need for increasing the interest and excitement of casino gaming, and thus the revenues to the casinos. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> 1. Advantages of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> One of the advantages of the present invention is that it provides increased player interest and excitement to primary wagering games by providing a jackpot that combines random jackpots, fixed jackpots, and incrementing jackpots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A further advantage of the present invention is its adaptability as either a component of the primary wagering game or as a separate side wager. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the present invention is its adaptability to networked gaming devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> These and other advantages of the present invention may be realized by reference to the remaining portions of the specification, claims, and abstract. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> 2. Brief Description of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The present invention comprises a method for including a random incrementing jackpot component in primary wagering games such as wagering games in casinos. The invention further comprises random incrementing jackpot devices for use with wagering gaming devices, and wagering gaming devices that include a random incrementing jackpot component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The method of including a random incrementing jackpot component in a primary wagering game comprises the steps of requiring each of the one or more players to place a wager. The wagers are typically in the form of money or purchased gaming chips though non-money wagers such as non-purchased gaming chips or tokens can be used. A round of the primary wagering game is conducted. Each player participating in the jackpot component having a predetermined arrangement of indicia such as on playing cards or the reels of a slot machine, resulting from completion of the round is designated as a winning player. Each winning player is provided an opportunity to win a bonus prize that is randomly selected from a group of prizes that includes an incrementing jackpot. The other bonus prizes may include jackpots such as fixed jackpots or other non-money prizes. Preferably, each player wishing to participate in the jackpot component of the primary wagering game is required to place a side wager separate and distinct from the wager on the primary wagering game. The designation as a winner is then from among only those players having the predetermined arrangement of indicia whom placed a side wager. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The random incrementing jackpot device comprises a random prize generating device and an incrementing device. The incrementing device increments the amount of an incrementing jackpot from a minimum jackpot toward a maximum jackpot. The random prize-generating device randomly chooses one of a plurality of possible prizes, one of the possible prizes being the incrementing jackpot. The incrementing device can be stopped manually or automatically when the random prize-generating device chooses the incrementing jackpot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The game device comprises the random incrementing jackpot device and a primary gaming device. The primary gaming device might be, for example, a casino card table for &ldquo;live&rdquo; playing using conventional playing cards, a video card machine using virtual cards, an electro-mechanical slot machine, or a video slot machine using virtual reels. The random incrementing jackpot device is operatively connected to the primary gaming device. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Prize Wheel </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> With continuing reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, prize wheel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a base <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Base <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may be of an oval shape so as to comfortably fit on upper surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> between card area <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, cushion <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, and straight side <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of tabletop <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. A flat upright frame <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> having a narrow lower portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and a round upper portion <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is affixed to base <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. A segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is rotationally mounted to upper portion <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>. Segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is divided into a plurality of pie-shaped segments <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> that denote winning various prizes. Segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> further includes a pie-shaped jackpot segment <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> that denotes winning the incrementing jackpot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> stops on only one of segments <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> each time spun so as to indicate a single prize won. This is accomplished by means of a plurality of pins <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> which extend perpendicularly from the outer periphery <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. A downwardly directed pointer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to an upward extension <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of upright frame <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. Pointer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is resiliently biased to point downwardly to alternately contact pins <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> as segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> rotates to randomly stop disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> on one of segments <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. This constitutes the &ldquo;random&rdquo; portion of the random incrementing jackpots when using jackpot device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. When disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is spun by hand and stops on the jackpot segment <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, a switch device in the form of a jackpot button <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> can be manually activated to signal micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through a cable <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> to stop incrementing the jackpot. The amount of the jackpot won is thus frozen on jackpot display <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Automatic Jackpot Control </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> An incrementing jackpot control system (not shown) can be incorporated into prize wheel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to automatically stop the incrementing of the jackpot when segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> stops on the jackpot segment <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. This eliminates the need for jackpot button <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to be used to stop the incrementing. The system includes a sensor and target arrangement such as a Hall effect sensor and magnet, an optical sensor and a target, or other such arrangement known in industry. The sensor is affixed to the upper portion <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> of frame <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> adjacent pointer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. The target is affixed to the back surface (not shown) of segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> along jackpot segment <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> adjacent outer periphery <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The sensor and target pass closely together as segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> spins. The sensor generates a signal whenever the target is in close proximity. Therefore, when segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is spinning, a plurality of short duration signals is sent by the sensor through cable <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. If segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> stops at the jackpot segment <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, a long duration signal is sent by the sensor along cable <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to stop incrementing the jackpot shown on jackpot display <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Automatic Spinning of Prize Wheel </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> An electric motor with clutch system (not shown) can be used with the incrementing jackpot control system to eliminate the need for hand-spinning segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. One example of such a motor and clutch system comprises an electric motor that drives a clutch having an output shaft with a resilient drive wheel. The motor with clutch system is integrally built into prize wheel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the drive wheel bearing against the annular outer surface of a tubular extension of segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> (not shown) that extends perpendicularly from the rear surface of segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. The electric motor drives segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> when jackpot button <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is actuated and is disconnected from segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> by the clutch disengaging when jackpot button <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is released or after being actuated for a predetermined or random period of time. This allows the drive wheel to freely spin along with segmented wheel <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> without the drag from the electric motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Micro-Controller </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a microprocessor, memory, and other associated electronics (not shown) known in the industry that perform the necessary electrical functions including that of a meter for incrementing the jackpot. If time-based incrementing is used, the operation of micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such as setting the minimum and maximum jackpots, holding at the maximum jackpot or scrolling, and the time period and the amount of each increment may be through a plurality of controls <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> with a plurality of light emitting diodes <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> showing the status of micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. If progressive incrementing is used, then micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is connected to the electronics of the particular gaming device or devices such that the amount of the wagering is input into the micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The setting of the minimum and maximum jackpots, the holding at the maximum jackpot or scrolling, and the percentage of the wagers placed used to increment the jackpot may also be done using controls <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a laptop computer (not shown) can be connected via a cable to a port (not shown) of micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to program the microprocessor and electronics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Jackpot Display </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Jackpot display <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be any of a number of standard designs known in the industry. Examples include those having a liquid crystal display (LCD), light emitting diodes (LED&apos;s), a cathode ray tube (CRT), or a stenciled backlit translucent material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Method of Using Random Incrementing Jackpots for Card Games </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Most any wagering game can be adapted for the method of including a random incrementing jackpot component of the present invention. One such method, as used in card games, is shown in the block diagram <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, such as used on game device <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Prior to actual play, the casino determines the particular card or combinations of cards that will be needed to win a chance at the random incrementing jackpot, block <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>. Actual play is started by the respective players making initial wagers on the primary card game by placing the desired number of chips in the respective main wagering areas <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>. Any side wagers are placed with the desired number of chips in the respective side wagering area <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, block <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. Cards are then dealt, and a hand or round of the primary card game is played to conclusion, block <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight>. If none of the players made a side wager, return is made to block <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> to start play again, block <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. If one or more players did place a side wager, determination must be made whether that player or players received the predetermined card combination, block <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. If not, the dealer collects all the side wagers and return is made to block <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> to start play again, block <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> If one or more players did receive the predetermined card combination, the dealer collects all of the side wagers except for that of each winning player. Each winning player then gets the opportunity to win one of the random prizes including a portion of or the entire incrementing jackpot. This is done by each winning player or the dealer spinning segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of prize wheel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, either manually by hand or automatically by actuating jackpot button <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, block <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Each winning player receives whatever prize is associated with the segment <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> indicated by pointer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> when segmented disk <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> stops spinning. Determination is made as to whether the randomly chosen bonus prize is the incrementing jackpot, block <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. If pointer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> indicates any of segments <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, which are bonus prizes other than the incrementing jackpot, the winning player receives the particular bonus prize indicated, block <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. If the pointer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> indicates the jackpot segment <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, then the incrementing of jackpot display <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is stopped, either automatically or by using jackpot button <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, block <highlight><bold>167</bold></highlight>. The winning player is paid the entire amount of the incrementing jackpot shown on the jackpot display <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as the bonus, or a proportionate share if more than one winning player wins the incrementing jackpot during their individual spins, block <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Setting the Payouts for an Incrementing Jackpot of the Progressive Type </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The process for setting the payouts for an incrementing jackpot of the progressive type is shown in the block diagram <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the process being similar to the time-based type. Initially, a player payback percentage for the incrementing jackpot is determined, block <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. This is primarily a financial decision to be made by the casino to satisfy the casino&apos;s requirements for earning money. The payouts for the pay table are established, the top amount being the maximum jackpot for the incrementing jackpot, block <highlight><bold>173</bold></highlight>. A lower amount for the minimum jackpot is likewise established and the pay table recalculated. The two hold percent are the range of the jackpot, block <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. The minimum jackpot and the maximum jackpot are set so as to satisfy the player payback percentage and such that the average of the values of the jackpots and the probabilities of winning each within the range are equal to the amount of a desired fixed jackpot. The metering is set such that the jackpot starts at the minimum jackpot and increments to the maximum jackpot, block <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight>. When the maximum jackpot is reached, the meter resets to the minimum jackpot, block <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Setting Metering Speed of the Incrementing Jackpot </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The setting of the metering speed at which micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> increments the jackpot is shown in the block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The setting of the metering speed begins with inputting the minimum and maximum jackpots determined in setting the payouts explained above, block <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight>. The time periods at which the meter of micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will increment the jackpot is then set, block <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. The amount the jackpot will increment each time period is then set, block <highlight><bold>191</bold></highlight>. The time period and the amount by which the meter increments the jackpot are primarily marketing decisions based on what metering speed will best maintain the excitement and interest of the players. When the prize wheel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or other prize-generating device stops on the incrementing jackpot as the bonus prize, then meter of micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> stops incrementing of the jackpot, block <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. The jackpot display <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> shows the amount of the incrementing jackpot won. Following winning of the jackpot, the meter of micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be reset and started over at the minimum jackpot, block <highlight><bold>197</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Programming the Micro-Controller </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> The meter specifications of the minimum and maximum jackpots, and the metering speed are entered into micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> using the controls <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a laptop computer can be connected to the port of micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to program the microprocessor and electronics of the micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can also be programmed to increment from the minimum jackpot to the maximum jackpot, and upon reaching the maximum jackpot, the meter resets to the minimum jackpot. The incrementing jackpot thus scrolls continuously upwardly with the cycle repeating until won. Micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can alternatively be programmed to remain at the maximum jackpot until the jackpot is won, remain there for a predetermined period of time, or remain there until a predetermined date and/or time. Micro-controller <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can also be programmed to reverse the direction of incrementing upon reaching the maximum jackpot to increment downward. The upward incrementing begins again upon reaching the minimum jackpot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Example of a Time-Based Incrementing Jackpot for Card Games </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The casino sets the metering speed of the incrementing jackpot so that it starts at a minimum jackpot of $1,000.00 and increments to a maximum jackpot of $10,000.00 every day. Upon reaching the maximum jackpot at the end of the day, the jackpot is reset to the minimum jackpot and starts incrementing again the next day. The payback percentage to the player on just the random jackpot varies from 80% to 84%. The incrementing meter represents 1% to 3% of the total payback percentage, which varies based on the jackpot amount when the player wins it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Example of a Time-Based Incrementing Jackpot for Slots </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The casino has set the metering speed of the incrementing jackpot so that it starts at a minimum jackpot of $1,000.00 and increments to a maximum jackpot of $10,000.00 every day. When the jackpot reaches the maximum jackpot at the end of the day, the jackpot is reset to the minimum jackpot and starts incrementing again the next day. The payback percentage to the player on all random jackpots varies from 13% to 15%. The incrementing meter represents 1% to 3% of the total payback percentage, which varies based on the jackpot amount when the player wins it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Wheel of Madness Random Incrementing Jackpot </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The Wheel of Madness is an example of a random incrementing jackpot for card games such as blackjack. The Wheel of Madness begins by players wishing to participate in the jackpot component of the card game each placing a side wager. A hand or round of the card game is played. If one or more of the players participating in the jackpot component receive a predetermined combination of playing cards, those winning players qualify for the random incrementing jackpot. Each winning player pushes a jackpot button that spins a prize wheel that randomly stops on any one of five fixed jackpots or one incrementing jackpot. The winning players win the jackpot on which the prize wheel stops. If more than one winning player wins the incrementing jackpot, they split the jackpot between themselves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Jackpot Amounts and Probabilities of Winning Wheel of Madness </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> The six jackpots are as shown in the following chart. The five fixed jackpots range from $10.00 up to $50.00. There is a 1 in 1,875 chance of winning the incrementing jackpot on each spin of the prize wheel.

Initially, a player plays the slot machine <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> in the usual manner by depositing coins, wagering, and actuating the reels, block <highlight><bold>371</bold></highlight>. Determination is then made whether a winning combination of indicia is received on reels <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> that also includes the special jackpot indicia <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> on reel <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> (i.e. the bonus reel combination), block <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>. If the reels <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> stop without having the bonus reel combination, the player does not qualify for the random jackpot, block <highlight><bold>377</bold></highlight>.

If the reels <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> stop on the bonus reel combination, the winning player or players press one of the operating buttons <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> which is configured as a jackpot button to generate the random jackpot, block <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, slot machine <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> can automatically generate the random jackpot as explained above. Determination is then made whether the incrementing jackpot has been won, block <highlight><bold>383</bold></highlight>. If other than the incrementing jackpot is indicated by one of jackpot designators <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> being illuminated, the player wins the jackpot so indicated, block <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>. If the incrementing jackpot is indicated by jackpot designator <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> being illuminated, then the incrementing of the jackpot is stopped, block <highlight><bold>389</bold></highlight>. The player is paid the amount of the incrementing jackpot, block <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">CONCLUSION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> It can now be seen that the present invention solves many of the problems associated with the prior art. The present invention provides methods, incrementing jackpot devices, and game devices that include a jackpot component in a primary wagering game as part of the underlying or primary game, or as a separate side wager. The present invention further provides an incrementing jackpot as one of a number of possible bonus prizes which can be won by random selection. The present invention still further provides increased player excitement to wagering games making such games more interesting and exciting to retain the players wagering for a longer time period increasing casino profits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Although the description above contains many specifications, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but as merely providing illustrations of some of presently preferred embodiments of this invention. The specification, for instance, makes reference to wagering games such as standard casino card games, slots, and other such casino games. However, the present invention is not intended to be limited to casino use nor to standard casino wagering games. Rather it is intended that the present invention can be used in any type of game where a jackpot component is desired. Likewise, while wagering games are preferred, the present invention can be used such as with casino games wherein money wagers are not placed such as for charity events. Also, the present invention can be used to provide increased player interest and excitement to other games in which wagers are typically not placed. Likewise, while a random jackpot wheel can be the random jackpot generating device, the random jackpot wheel can be replaced by a lighted display case which lights up each jackpot or other prize contained therein one at a time and then stops with the only one jackpot or other prize illuminated, which is the jackpot won. Alternatively, a winning player could pick one box from a variety of boxes each concealing a different jackpot or other prize. Finally, a winning player could choose, or be automatically chosen for the player, an animated character from a variety of animated characters (e.g. race horses) that participates in some sort of race or other contest, with the player being awarded a random jackpot based on the outcome of the contest. Thus, the scope of the invention should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalents rather than by the examples given. </paragraph>
