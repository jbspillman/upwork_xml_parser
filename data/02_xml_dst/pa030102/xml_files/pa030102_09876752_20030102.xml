<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A seamless elongate pressure actuated switch includes a seamless tubular sheath fabricated from a resiliently flexible polymeric resin, and two separate and spaced apart conductive coatings disposed lengthwise along the inside surface of the tubular sheath. The sheath is deformable in response to pressure applied thereto to move the conductive coatings into contact with each other. The conductive coatings are the only means of conducting electricity lengthwise along the inside of the sheath. The thickness of the coatings ranges from about 0.00001 inches to about 0.01 inches. The elongated pressure actuated switch can be made by coating the inside wall of the tubular sheath with a conductive coating and then dividing the conductive coating into two spaced apart portions, or by coextrusion of the spaced apart conductive coatings with the sheath material. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Disclosure </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present disclosure relates to electrical switching devices and particularly to an elongate pressure actuated switch and a method for making same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Various types of elongate pressure actuated electrical switches are known. Typically, such switches are used, for example, for road vehicle detection to survey the amount of traffic using a road, to operate equipment such as traffic signals, warning signals, garage and gate doors, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,762,970 to Brinsley, for example, discloses an elongate pressure actuated cable switch which includes a central elongate conductor, a flexible insulating element helically wound around the central conductor, a flexible tubular body of electrically conductive plastic surrounding the central conductor, two elongate conductors in electrical contact with the outer surface of the flexible tubular body, and an overall insulating sheath of a transverse cross-section of approximately semi-circular shape having a flat surface for supporting the cable switch on the ground. Each outer conductor is embedded in the sheath alongside the flexible electrically conductive tubular body at a position intermediate of the flat surface and the longitudinal axis of the central conductor. When a pressure is applied to a part of the overall outer sheath remote from its flat surface, the central conductor is urged in a direction towards the flat surface to effect electrical contact with the two outer conductors via the flexible electrically conductive tubular body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,742,196 to Kelly discloses an elongate pressure actuated electrical switch which includes a flexible insulative tubular body having a bore and incorporating at opposed locations around its periphery two sectoral portions of electrically conductive material. Elongate conductors extend lengthwise in electrical contact with the conductive sectoral portions. An overall outer sheath surrounds the tubular body. When pressure is downwardly applied to the sheath the opposed electrically conductive sectoral portions are pressed into contact with each other to effect electrical connection between the conductors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,983 to Ishihara et al. discloses a pressure sensitive cable switch which includes a pair of metallic conductors arranged in opposing relation to one another on the neutral axis for bending within the cross section of a rubber tube, and extend in the longitudinal direction of the tube. A pair of belt shaped electrodes made of conductive rubber material or other conductive materials and embedding the metallic conductors therein, are disposed to oppose each other on the inner circumferential surface of the tube with respect to the neutral axis for bending and extend in the longitudinal direction of the tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A feature of the prior art is the use of a metal wire as a means to conduct electrical current along the length of the tube, even though conductive elastomers may be included as components of the switch. The necessity of employing a metal wire adds to the expense of making the switch. It would be advantageous to have a tubular switch wherein the metal wire conductors are not needed. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As used herein the terms &ldquo;conductive&rdquo;, &ldquo;resistance&rdquo;, &ldquo;insulative&rdquo; and their related forms, pertain to the electrical properties of the materials described, unless indicated otherwise. The terms &ldquo;top&rdquo;, &ldquo;bottom&rdquo;, &ldquo;upper&rdquo;, &ldquo;lower&rdquo; and like terms are used relative to each other. The terms &ldquo;elastomer&rdquo; and &ldquo;elastomeric&rdquo; are used herein to refer to a material that can undergo at least about 10% deformation elastically. Typically, elastomeric materials suitable for the purposes described herein include polymeric materials such as plasticized polyvinyl chloride (&ldquo;PVC&rdquo;), thermoplastic polyurethane, natural and synthetic rubbers and the like. Composition percentages are by weight unless specified otherwise. Except for the claims all quantities are modified by the term &ldquo;about&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Resistance&rdquo; refers to the opposition of the material to the flow of electric current along the current path and is measured in ohms. Resistance increases in proportion to the length of the current path and the specific resistance, or &ldquo;resistivity&rdquo;, of the material, and it varies inversely to the amount of cross-sectional area available to the current path. The resistivity is a property of the material and may be thought of as a measure of (resistance/length)&times;area. More particularly, the resistance may be determined in accordance with the following formula: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, an elongate pressure actuated switch and method for making an elongate pressure actuated switch are illustrated. More particularly, in a first step there is provided an elongated pressure actuated switch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a seamless tubular outer sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having an internal surface defining an axial bore. Sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is fabricated from a non-conductive polymeric resin which is resiliently flexible and preferably transparent. For example, sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is preferably fabricated by extrusion from plasticized polyvinyl chloride (&ldquo;PVC&rdquo;), polyurethane, silicone, or natural or synthetic rubber. A suitable commercially available sheath material is TYGON&reg; brand tubing which is made from PVC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In a second step a conductive coating composition is applied to the internal surface of the sheath. The coating composition is a fluid which contains a binder such as a polymeric resin, a conductive filler, and a solvent and/or diluent. The binder can be, for example, polyurethane, PVC, and the like. The conductive filler is preferably a finely powdered conductive material such as powdered metal (e.g., copper, silver, gold, zinc, aluminum, nickel), a metal coated powder (e.g., silver coated copper, silver coated glass particles, silver coated aluminum), graphite powder, graphite fibers or carbon (e.g., carbon black). Powdered metal, especially powdered silver, is preferred. In organic solvent systems the solvent can be a ketone (e.g., methylethyl ketone, diethyl ketone, acetone, etc.), an ether (e.g., tetrahydrofuran, etc.), an ester (e.g., butyl acetate, etc.), an alcohol (e.g., isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, etc.) an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g., toluene, xylene, etc.) or any other fluid suitable for dissolving the selected binder. In aqueous systems water is used as the diluent for aqueous emulsions and may optionally include a surfactant. Suitable coating compositions are set forth below in Tables I and II.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In a third step the fluid coating composition is applied to the interior surface of the sheath. A suitable method of applying the fluid coating composition is to pump a quantity of the fluid coating composition through the bore of the sheath. Preferably, substantially the entire interior surface of the sheath is coated in such a manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In a fourth step the fluid coating is dried to form a non-fluid conductive layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> along the interior surface of the sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and concentric with the sheath. Drying can be accomplished by blowing warm dry air or nitrogen through the bore of sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In the dried coating the composition percentage of the conductive filler preferably can range from about 30% to 95%. The conductive layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is elastomeric and can range in thickness from 0.1 mils to 10 mils (1.0 mil&equals;0.001 inches). The resistance of the conductive layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> depends at least in part on the type and composition percentage of conductive filler and the dimensions of the layer. For most applications a resistance value ranging from 300 ohms per square down to 0.001 ohms per square is appropriate. In terms of specific resistance, the conductive layer of the present invention can possess a resistivity about as low as that of silver (i.e., about 1.59 microhm-cm), or higher, depending on the percentage and type of conductive filler. This low resistivity allows the elongated pressure actuated switch of the present invention to be used without conductive wires extending through the interior of the sheath. Rather, in a preferred embodiment the conductive electrode films <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> formed from conductive layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are the only means for conducting electricity lengthwise along the inside wall of the sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The conductive electrode films are adapted to carry a current load of up to 5 amps/cm<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In another step of the present invention the conductive layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is divided into two separate and spaced apart conductive films to form two contact electrodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> One method of achieving the division of the conductive layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is by employing a beam of high energy radiation. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> beam <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of radiation is directed laterally through sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> along the length of sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> from a radiation source <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Radiation beam <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be a gamma ray beam, X-ray beam, electron beam, or laser beam. The beam passes through sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and successively strikes the conductive layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at points <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> where it is absorbed by the conductive metal filler (e.g., the silver powder) and causes heating. The intensity of the beam is selected such that the heating is sufficient to burn away the binder of the conductive layer, thereby forming void spaces. The sheath can be moved longitudinally such that the beam forms two elongated parallel void spaces in the conductive layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> extending along the length of the sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, either simultaneously in one operation or in successive operations to form a pressure actuated switch as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Referring the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, elongated pressure actuated switch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and first and second spaced apart conductive electrode films <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> which are at least partially defined by elongated void spaces <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The width of the beam <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> corresponds to the desired width of the void spaces <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, upon the application of force F at some point along the length of the elongated pressure actuated switch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> deforms under pressure, thereby bringing conductive electrode films <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> into physical and electrical contact and thereby closing the switch to allow current to pass. Each conductive electrode film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> can be individually connected to a respective wire lead by means of a termination method and device described below, and incorporated into an electrical circuit for controlling the operation of a motorized device such as a movable door. The conductive electrode films <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> are the only interior means of conducting electricity along the length of the pressure actuated switch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. No interior lengthwise conductive wires are needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> an implement and alternative method of making the elongated pressure actuated switch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are illustrated. More particularly, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, hot wire cutter <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes an elongated outer body cover <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> having an axial bore through which insulated wires <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> are disposed. The wires terminate in an exposed distal cutting tip <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, which is a heating element with two laterally extending portions <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and which may be in a circular configuration, as shown, or in an oval, triangular, square or other configuration. Proximal end portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> includes connecting terminals <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> of the conductive wires <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, respectively. When terminals <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> are connected to a power source and electric current is sent through wires <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, the cutting tip is heated by resistance heating. The temperature is regulated such that the temperature of the cutting tip is sufficiently hot to melt the binder resin of the conductive coating. The hot wire cutter is configured and dimensioned so as to slidingly fit within the bore of sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, to make the pressure actuated switch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is provided with a dried conductive layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The unenergized cutter <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with a cold cutting tip <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> is inserted through the bore of sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The tip is then energized until it becomes sufficiently hot to melt the binder resin of the conductive layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The cutter <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is then moved proximally through the sheath with the lateral portions <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the cutting tip <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> in contact with the conductive layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As the cutting tip moves through the sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> it forms two opposite linear voids <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> in the conductive layer which divide the conductive layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> into two spaced apart opposing conductive electrode coatings <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In yet another feature of the present invention the elongated pressure actuated switch can be fabricated by means of coextrusion. Various methods and apparatus for coextrusion of layered polymers are known to those with skill in the art. For example, apparatus and methods for coextrusion are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,184,358, 3,223,761, 3,275,725, 3,640,659, 3,890,083, 3,947,173, 4,125,585, 4,161,379, 4,236,884, 4,244,914, 4,248,824, 5,853,770, 5,882,694, all of which are incorporated by reference herein. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, a die head <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for coextrusipn of the elongated pressure actuated switching device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is illustrated. Die head <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a body <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> having an annular channel <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> for passage therethrough of the polymeric material for sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The annular channel <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> terminates in distal exit opening <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. Molten polymer sheath material flows into channel <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> through proximal access opening <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight>. A concentric annular channel <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> has a smaller diameter than channel <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and is provided for conveying the conductive electrode coating material. Blocking barriers <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> divide the flow of conductive electrode coating material in channel <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, and direct the flow of conductive electrode coating material, into two channel portions <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>, which flare outward to join channel <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. A central axial channel <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is provided for compressed gas. In operation fluid polymeric sheath material is sent through channel <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and an extrudable conductive electrode material is sent through channel <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. The conductive electrode material is divided into two spaced apart sections <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> by barriers <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> and is joined to the interior surface of the sheath by entering into channel <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The die head is heated to maintain the polymeric in a fluid state. Upon exiting at opening <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> the polymeric material is chilled so as to solidify. Compressed gas (air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc.) is pumped through channel <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> to prevent the sheath from collapsing in upon itself while in the softened state at the exit opening <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. The resulting elongated switch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, elongate pressure actuated switch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is terminated by a terminal plug <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> which seals the end of tubular sheath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and provides means for electrical connection to an electrical circuit. More specifically, terminal plug <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes a body portion <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> of insulating material such as solid polymeric resin. Extending from the body portion <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> is a projection which includes first and second electrode contact <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, and a resiliently compressible non-conductive polymeric foam member <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> between the first and second electrode contacts <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. First electrode contact <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is adapted to contact first conductive electrode film <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Second electrode contact <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> is adapted to contact second conductive electrode film <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The foam member <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> resiliently biases the first and second electrode contacts <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> away from each other so as to facilitate the contacting between the electrode contacts <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> and the respective conductive electrode films <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The first and second electrode contacts <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> can be fabricated from metal foils or sheets. The foam member <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> can be, for example, an expanded cellular polyurethane, plasticized PVC, silicone, rubbers and the like. Clips <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> secure the first and second electrode contacts <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> within the body portion <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>. Electrically conductive wires <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> are connected to clips <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and make electrical contact with the respective electrode contacts <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>. Wires <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> may be connected to an electrical control circuit. Sheath <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> insulates the wires <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The opposite end of the pressure actuated switch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be terminated by a simple, non-electrical plug to seal the end of the sheath and prevent the entry of moisture, debris, and unwanted matter into the interior of the pressure actuated switch <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
