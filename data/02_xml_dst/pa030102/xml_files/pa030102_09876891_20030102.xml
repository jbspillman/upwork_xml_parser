<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A device for expressing milk from one or more breasts has at least one, and preferably two expressers and a pump. The expressers each have a cup for fitting on the breasts and a cup outlet to which a vacuum created by the pump can be connected. The cups have a flexible liner which collapses around the breast to establish the vacuum. Pulsating pressure is applied to the outside of the liner to increase the vacuum and stimulate milk production. The pressure is applied through lines which are vented to maintain adequate, consistent pressure pulses without stalling the pump. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to apparatus for extracting milk, and more particularly, to breast pumps which are convenient and comfortable to use. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Pumps for expressing milk from breasts are well-known. One known breast pump is disclosed in Whittlestone U.S. Pat. No. 4,607,596. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The Whittlestone patent discloses a breast pump having two milk collectors connected to a pump which applies both a vacuum and pulsating pressure to the breasts to extract milk. The pulsating pressure reciprocates between positive and negative (vacuum) pressure. The pulsating pressure gently massages and compresses the breasts to stimulate milk production, and the vacuum secures the milk collectors to the breasts and helps draw the milk and collect it. The pulsating pressure actually cyclically increases the vacuum level at the breast(s), which further stimulates milk production. However, the pressure is not relieved during pulsation in the Whittlestone patent, so pressure can build to a level sufficient to stall a small motor in a well-sealed system. In addition, the amplitude of the pressure pulses can be reduced by pressure build-up, which is also undesirable. Thus, there is a need for breast pumps that use pulsation as well as vacuum to draw milk, and have controlled relief of the pressure during operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the Whittlestone device, milk from the two collectors is commonly drawn into a first collection vessel, and then a second collection vessel. The milk is drawn through vacuum lines, though, which makes cleaning difficult. Accordingly, there is a need for breast pumps which are more sanitary and easier to clean than the Whittlestone device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The Whittlestone patent discloses a breast cup having a housing, a relatively soft inner ring or donut, and a flexible liner. The liner wraps around the outlet of the cup, and a bung is inserted into the cup outlet to pass the vacuum and milk. At the inlet side, the liner is simply folded over the outside of the housing. This design has limitations. The liner is not accurately aligned and reliably sealed on the inlet side, so moisture and other contaminants can get inside the liner, which is undesirable. At the outlet, the nipple can contact the bung and the liner can collapse around the breast, which can be uncomfortable, and can cause unnecessary trauma, including potential abrasion at the tip of the nipple. Accordingly, there is a need for breast pumps having cups which better fix the liner to the housing. There is also a need for breast pump cups which protect at least the end of the nipple from discomfort due to pulsating pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The breast pump disclosed in the Whittlestone patent is a diaphragm pump operated by an electric motor. Rotation of the motor shaft is translated into back and forth action by a somewhat large and cumbersome linkage which moves the diaphragm. This adds not only size but weight to the pump, as well. Moreover, the motor must be fairly large, in part because a high vacuum is needed for cleaning purposes, and to maintain adequate vacuum and pressure if the system is leaky. These are problems because convenient storage and portability are desirable to breast pump users. Thus, there is a need for breast pumps which are lighter and smaller than known devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, one object of this invention is to provide new and improved apparatus for extracting milk from breasts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another object is to provide new and improved breast pumps which are more convenient and comfortable to use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object is to provide new and improved breast pumps that use both vacuum and pulsation pressure to collect milk, and control the pulsation pressure to maintain consistent, predetermined increases in the vacuum as the milk is collected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Still a further object is to provide new and improved breast pumps which are more sanitary, easy to clean and easy to disassemble and re-assemble in the field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Yet another object is to provide new and improved breast pumps which are relatively light, compact and portable. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A device for expressing milk from one or both breasts has at least one milk collector and a pump. Preferably, the device has first and second collectors (also called expressers), so that both breasts can be milked simultaneously. Each expresser has a cup assembly which fits on the breast, a pulsation port to which a supply of pressurized pulsating air is connected, and a vacuum port to which a vacuum supply is connected. The pulsating air and vacuum are created by the pump. In use, pulsating air causes massage and gentle compression of the breast and stimulates milk production, while the vacuum secures a liner in the collector on the breast and expresses the milk from the breast. Among other things, the pressure pulses increase the vacuum at the breast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Both vacuum and pulsating air pressure are fairly well controlled by adequately sealing the various parts of the device and providing a pressure release vent for the pressurized air supply to each expresser. A vacuum adjustment is also provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The collectors also include a cap and manifold which direct the vacuum and pressure, a cup assembly which is preferably press fit onto the manifold, a collection vessel secured to the bottom of the manifold, and, if desired, a one-way check valve or the like between the manifold and the collection vessel. After passing through the vacuum adjustment, the vacuum is directed through the cap and manifold, collection vessel and cup assembly so that the milk is drawn into the collector with little or no milk entering the vacuum lines to the pump. A filter may be provided for added isolation of the vacuum pump and vacuum lines, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The cup assembly includes a bell housing, a relatively soft donut shaped pad, and the flexible liner, preferably made of silicone, nitrile or other suitable material that meets requirements for medical materials. The liner is secured to the inlet side of the cup assembly by a locking type of attachment, and extends around the bottom or lower end of the bell housing, where it is secured by another locking press fit configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The bottom end of the cup assembly fits into a receptacle in the manifold. The receptacle has a hollow boss which extends into the cup assembly by a desired distance. The hollow portion inside the boss increases the area for extension of the nipple during milk expression, avoiding potentially uncomfortable contact at the nipple area. The boss also prevents the liner from collapsing around the end of the nipple during use, and keeps the throat of the cup assembly open for milk flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The collector can be easily disassembled and cleaned in a dishwasher or the like, by removing the collection vessel and using or storing the milk, removing the cap and then removing the cup assembly. The cup assembly can be cleaned without removing the liner, if desired, or the liner can be removed and cleaned separately, or replaced. A cleaning cap can be placed over the air pulsation port of the cup assembly when the cup assembly is cleaned in its assembled condition, to prevent water from entering the space between the liner and the bell housing. A valve could be used in place of the cap for this purpose, if desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The manifold, cap and valve can also be washed. The cup assembly can be easily reassembled after cleaning by reinserting the cup assembly in the manifold, re-attaching the cap to the manifold and cup assembly, and securing another collection vessel to the bottom of the manifold, with or without the check valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The pump includes a movable diaphragm in a chamber. The diaphragm is oscillated back and forth by a relatively small linear actuator device such as a stepper motor. The motor preferably is a self-contained system that moves its final object axially. The motor can have a shaft which does not rotate, but moves back and forth axially. The shaft of the motor is directly or nearly directly linked to the diaphragm, which eliminates complex and cumbersome linkage components, reducing the size and weight of the pump.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided for expressing milk from one breast, or from two breasts simultaneously. The apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a first collector or expresser <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a second expresser <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. It is likely that both expressers would generally be used, but only one expresser could be used, if desired, preferably by disconnecting the vacuum line from the unused expresser and covering the unused vacuum port of the pump with a cap (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A pump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is connected to both expressers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through vacuum lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and air pressure lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The vacuum and pulsation lines can be configured in any suitable way. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, vacuum hoses <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and pressure hoses <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are connected to the pump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a connector <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Vacuum hoses <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and pressure hoses <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are connected to the other end of the connector <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and the expressers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with adapters <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference>), if needed. The connector <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has openings for the lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and a throat <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which connects the vacuum lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to each other, creating a common vacuum at the expressers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. A threaded needle valve <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in the throat <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> permits easy adjustment of the vacuum by venting atmospheric air into the system as desired. The connector <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be secured to a housing, if desired, to provide easy vacuum and pressure transmission through the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The pump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> creates a vacuum which engages the breasts, and contributes to drawing the milk from the breasts. The pump also creates reciprocating compression and release pressure pulsation around the areola and some or all of the nipple, as will be seen. The pump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be powered by line voltage, a battery, manually or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The expressers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are shown in greater detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Each expresser includes a manifold <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a cup assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which fits over a breast, a cap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a filter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>), a sealing device <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>such as a wipe washer, o-ring or the like, and a collection vessel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Gaskets <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are also included, to better seal the vacuum system. A valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be included, though it is not necessary. The collection vessel can be a bottle made of plastic-like material or the like or a bag, and can be oriented at an obtuse angle with respect to the cup assembly, as shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The manifold <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes an opening <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which is preferably threaded, so that a collection vessel such as a plastic milk bottle can be threadedly secured to the manifold <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, with the valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is preferably a one-way check valve such as a duck bill valve or the like. When using the valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the gasket <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is not needed because the valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> seals the opening <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. A vent <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in the manifold <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is helpful because it keeps the collection vessel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> at atmospheric pressure when the valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is used. However, it is also possible to eliminate the valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, in which case there is also no need for the vent <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A vacuum is applied to the expresser through a port <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the cap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and is drawn through a vacuum path in the manifold <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> through an outlet opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the top of the manifold. The vacuum is drawn through an internal orifice <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to the opening <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in the midsection of the vacuum path, which is beneath the port <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the cup assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The vacuum tends to close the valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which in conjunction with the vent <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, prevents a substantial buildup of vacuum in the collection vessel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The vacuum is drawn from the opening <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to a manifold vacuum inlet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> through a channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The vacuum inlet <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> forms a cup assembly opening that is in communication with a milk outlet port <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the cup assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. When milk is drawn from the breast, the milk passes through the channel <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> under the force created by the vacuum, but most of the milk drops into the valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> through the force of gravity, and does not enter the orifice <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Cleaning is easier because milk is not drawn into the vacuum path beyond the collection vessel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. When sufficient milk collects in the valve <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, the weight of the milk forces the valve open, which releases the milk into the collection vessel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Because the milk falls down, the vacuum lines are not contaminated. In this manner, the milk is collected without contaminating the vacuum lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The cup assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has a milk inlet port <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in addition to the outlet port <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The components of the cup assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> include a bell housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, a donut shaped pad <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and a flexible liner <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, shown disassembled in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The cup assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> also has an air pressure pulsation port <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which forms part of a pressure path and allows pressurized air to enter a space <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> between the case bell housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the liner <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The cup assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is assembled by placing the donut shaped pad <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in the housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as shown, and does not need further securement. The pad <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is preferably made of a suitable foam material which is sized to fit snugly in the housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. However, the pad <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be easily removed by placing a finger through the opening in the ring and pulling the ring out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The liner <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is installed in the cup assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by securing an end <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> to the liner <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in a groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> formed in the housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>). The end <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> and groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are shaped to provide locking press fit type of securement. The liner could also be affixed to the housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by heat or chemical bonding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The liner <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> extends from the groove <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> over and around the pad <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and inside of the housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to a bottom end <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. An end <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the liner <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is inserted into a groove <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> near the end <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> for securement in a press fit fashion. The liner <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> can be any suitable shape, including the shape shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which includes a relatively narrow section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> near the inlet opening <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and a wider section <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> between the section <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the outlet end <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> of the cup assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This shape places more pressure around the areola region of the breast, while placing less pressure on the nipple itself. By sealing the liner to the case at both ends, the assembly can be washed without taking the liner off, if a cleaning cap <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is placed over the pressure inlet <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The cup assembly <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be press fit into a circular groove <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in the manifold <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The groove <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is formed by an outside wall <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and an inside boss <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The boss <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can extend outwardly as far as desired, and can be any suitable shape, such as circular, triangular, square, rectangular, elliptical, hexagonal, etc. Since the boss <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is hollow and prevents the liner <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> from collapsing under outside air pressure, the boss <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> protects any part of the nipple which is inside the boss from a pinching action caused by pressure when the liner is collapsed, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Abrasion is avoided because there is more room for breast extension during milk expression. The boss <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> also keeps the throat of the cup assembly open, so that the flow of milk is not inhibited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The cap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) includes an air pressure/pulsation channel <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which extends from a pressure inlet <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to the port <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as well as the port <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for the vacuum path. The cap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be press fit over the manifold opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the cup assembly air pressure/pulsation port <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and can be easily removed. When installed, the cap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> farther secures the cup assembly in the manifold, but both the cap and the manifold can be removed without tools for cleaning purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The filter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, if used, further prevents liquids, fats and solid components in the milk from entering the vacuum lines and the pump. The filter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is preferably permeable to air flow when dry and also when wet, which can happen if milk contacts the filter. Thus, if the filter becomes wet due to milk and/or water, air can still pass through the filter because the filter remains permeable to air. An example of such a filter is Versapor R1200 (part no. 66393) by Pall Corp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the pump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has two halves <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> secured together by screws or the like <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to form a chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The screws <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> also secure a movable diaphragm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> in place. The diaphragm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> divides the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> into two halves <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The diaphragm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is oscillated in a back and forth manner by a motor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. About 41-65 pulsations per minute at the breast (one pulsation being the result of both a back and forth motion of the diaphragm) are believed to produce suitable results, with about <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> pulsations per minute producing good results. The motor can be secured to the housing by bolts <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The motor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can be a stepper motor, which is one form of a linear actuator, which has a shaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> moves in and out of the motor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> in the axial direction without rotation. The shaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is threaded, and is moved by a rotating threaded ring <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which is similar to a nut. Rotation of the ring <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> moves the shaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> linearly. In this manner, the shaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> can move the diaphragm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> back and forth essentially directly, without large, complex linkages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The distal end of the shaft <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> can be guided by an opening <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in an end cap <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The end cap <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is secured by bolts <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The pump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also has vacuum outlets <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in the chamber <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, on opposite sides of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The vacuum lines <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are connected to the vacuum outlets <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Check valves such as duck bill valves <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> control the vacuum and pumping operation, and exhaust valves <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> release the pressure created in the chamber halves <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by the movement of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. However, some of the pressure generated by the diaphragm is transmitted through the pressure lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the collectors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The pressure forces the liners <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> against the breasts (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>), which further stimulates release of milk. While the vacuum is fairly continuous, though, the pressure pulsates, in part because the pressure is quickly bled through vents <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> in the pressure lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In fact, when the diaphragm moves away from a pressure line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, air is drawn out and a partial vacuum can be created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the effect of adequately vented pulsation pressure on the vacuum supplied to the liner. The pump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> generates a vacuum V<highlight><subscript>SYS</subscript></highlight>. Without pulsation pressure, the vacuum is fairly steady at V<highlight><subscript>SYS</subscript></highlight>. When pressure pulses are applied to the outside of the liner, though, the vacuum periodically increases to V<highlight><subscript>PEAK</subscript></highlight>. Those periodic increases stimulate milk production with less discomfort and a lower V<highlight><subscript>SYS </subscript></highlight>than is needed if pressure pulses are not applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a minimum V<highlight><subscript>SYS </subscript></highlight>of 0.5&Prime; mercury is maintained during use, and the maximum vacuum V<highlight><subscript>PEAK </subscript></highlight>does not exceed 5&Prime; mercury. The maximum vacuum V<highlight><subscript>PEAK </subscript></highlight>is preferably 3.0&Prime;-4.1&Prime; mercury. However, the maximum differential between V<highlight><subscript>SYS </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>PEAK </subscript></highlight>is preferably between 1&Prime; and 4.5&Prime; mercury. The vents <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> are sized to obtain a desired V<highlight><subscript>PEAK</subscript></highlight>, and avoid stalling due to overload. If the vents are too small, V<highlight><subscript>PEAK </subscript></highlight>will be too high and stalling could occur. If the vents are too large, V<highlight><subscript>PEAK </subscript></highlight>will be too low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The device is light weight, portable and compact because large motor linkages are eliminated. Wear is also reduced by simplifying the power train in this manner. The motor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can be any suitable device which creates a fairly self-contained drive system which is relatively small in size and fairly quiet. In fact, the motor can be an ordinary motor <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> with a threaded rotating shaft <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In that embodiment, a fixed ring <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is attached to the diaphragm. The ring <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is also threaded, so when the shaft <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> rotates clockwise and counter-clockwise, the diaphragm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> moves back and forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The motor can be controlled in any suitable manner, such as the control system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. An application specific integrated circuit or the like has a microprocessor <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and a ROM <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, programmed to cause a motor driver <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> to set the desired rate of rotation and the direction of rotation of the motor. The rotation rate, as well as the timing of the back and forth motion of the diaphragm, can be controlled in this manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The diaphragm <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can be any suitable configuration, such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which features a flat stiff middle section flanked by soft corrugations. Another design is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>, where a diaphragm <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> has a plurality of rings <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> joined by corrugations <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In use, power is applied to the pump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the expressers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are placed over the breasts. The vacuum V<highlight><subscript>SYS </subscript></highlight>created by the pump <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> secures the expressers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the breasts and helps draw milk from the breasts. The pressure pulsations massage and compress the breasts to stimulate milk production, and reduce the amount of vacuum needed to collect the milk. The air pressure lines are vented to obtain strong pulses without overloading the system. This reduces discomfort to the breasts. The device can be easily disassembled without tools, cleaned and reassembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The many advantages of this invention are now apparent. The pulsation pulses stimulate milk production, without overloading the system due to excessive pressure build-up in the pressure lines. Cleaning is more convenient because milk does not enter the vacuum lines. Moreover, the entire collector can be easily disassembled for cleaning and reassembled without tools. The bosses in the expressers protect the end of the nipple from irritation, which is comfortable. Moreover, the entire pump is small, lightweight and relatively quiet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> While the principles of the invention have been described above in connection with a specific apparatus and applications, it is to be understood that this description is made only by way of example and not as a limitation on the scope of the invention. For example, various aspects of the invention could be used to milk animals, as well as humans. </paragraph>
