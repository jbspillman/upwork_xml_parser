<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to delivering electronic content in a secure manner from a remote location. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> With the proliferation of computerized equipment on a large scale, the easy and rapid sharing of data once shared exclusively by &ldquo;hard copy&rdquo; methods is becoming more of a reality. This includes text, music, still pictures, games, software, video, and other types of information. The widespread use of the Internet has allowed users to download all types of information from remote locations. This has created a new information distribution model whose characteristics include speed, customer convenience, ease of bringing a work to market, and lower costs. Because much of the physical production of such works can be eliminated, a significant cost and time savings can be realized in bringing a work to market. Significant marketing improvements are also possible. For instance, a well-stocked store can now be the size of a kiosk or can be located in a single location and still be convenient to users throughout the world. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> With these considerable advantages come some disadvantages due to the ease of distribution. Primary among these is that the ease of distribution allows easy illicit proliferation of works. While it can take considerable time and effort to duplicate and distribute a traditional book, audio recording, or video to others, it is easier and takes far less time and effort to duplicate and distribute an electronic copy of the same work. This is of considerable concern to authors, artists, musicians, programmers, producers, publishers, and others whose works are not in the public domain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This problem has been recognized, and several schemes have been developed to encrypt programs and data so that they can only be used by the intended recipient. Some schemes are based on encrypting the data with a specific key, and transmitting the key along with the encrypted data, to the intended recipient. However, if the recipient is willing to share the key with the encrypted file, these schemes can be circumvented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> DeMont U.S. Pat. No. 5,982,889 teaches a method for verifying the authenticity of a user&apos;s access to information products. The disadvantage of this system is that authentication is done via a central site. The user who does not wish to (or cannot) connect to the network every time he wishes to use the product is excluded from using this product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Akiyama et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,805,699, propose a software copying system which enables copyrighted software recorded in a master storage medium to be copied to a user&apos;s target storage medium in a legitimate manner. The master storage medium (i.e., CD-ROM) has a software identifier, and the target storage medium has a storage medium identifier. The two identifiers are sent to a central site, which manages licensing for the rights to copy software products. At the central site, a first signature is generated from the two identifiers which is sent back to the computer user. In the computer of the user a second signature is generated from the same two identifiers. Only when the two signatures coincide with each other can the software programs be copied from the master storage medium to the target storage medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There are various problems associated with these methods. One is that many of them are open to what are known as &ldquo;hacks,&rdquo; which means that if one user determines the method of decrypting or using the application or data, it is very easy for that person to disseminate the manner of gaining access to the application or data. Some methods prevent this problem by making the use of information dependent upon a particular hardware combination. This approach creates a problem of portability. The legitimate user cannot use the product on a computer in a different location, nor can the user exercise fair use (e.g. resale, lending). The application may fail to start or the data may be unreadable if users change their hardware configuration, such as by an upgrade. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a legitimate user with content that can be downloaded readily from a network, such as the Internet, and used at multiple locations by the legitimate user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention that the content is protected against use and access to confidential information by an illegitimate user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> These objects are achieved by a method of transferring information from a content supplier from one or more databases, such information including program(s), audio, still pictures, video, data files (e.g. lists, spreadsheets, reports, documents, presentation graphics, sales information), or combinations thereof to a location that uses an authorizing hybrid disc that permits the use of such transferred information, comprising the steps of: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> (a) providing an authorizing hybrid optical disc having a ROM portion and a RAM portion; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> (b) providing the ROM portion to include a preformed identification signature which is impressed into the ROM portion of the disc and is arranged to be difficult for a pirate to copy; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> (c) providing the RAM portion which includes user-specific encrypted information which makes the optical disc unique for a specific user and in combination with the ROM preformed identification signature provides a user-personalized secure signature; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> (d) the content supplier encrypting information for each user using the user-personalized secure signature and downloading selected encrypted information to the particular user&apos;s memory location; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> (e) a particular user using the user-personalized secure signature to decode such downloaded selected encrypted information each time the user desires to access such information so that after use only the encoded encrypted information remains in the user memory location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The use of an authorizing hybrid optical disc for transferring content has advantages for both the supplier of the content and the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The content supplier can easily supply the content over a network, such as the Internet, which allows a potential world-wide audience with small overhead. The content supplied to a user can be &ldquo;locked&rdquo; to that user, so that an unauthorized user cannot use the content without the authorized user&apos;s authorizing disc. The supplier can supply confidential information, if there is a need, through the use of authorizing discs that can give the user access to this information, but the user cannot distribute this to others without also providing the single authorizing disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Further, if some content, such as a game, is lost or stolen, individual identification in the content relating to the disc it was originally &ldquo;locked&rdquo; to allow the origin of the loss to be traced. Additional security measure can also be added to the basic features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Advantages to the user include that the content is easily procured over a network connection, such as the Internet, despite the fact that it is locked to a particular user&apos;s authorizing disc. The content is portable; if the user wishes to take it along while travelling, the user can copy the content (e.g. to the computer&apos;s hard drive), then bring the disc and use it on any computer equipped with an optical disc drive, such as CD-ROM drive, DVD reader, etc. Further, should the user have an optical disc writer, the user can download more than one program or document to his authorizing disc. As long as room exists to write the content to the disc, the user could install additional content, which he could then use by only needing to bring a single disc along. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A further advantage is that this invention allows the user to exercise fair use while protecting the content owner from unauthorized distribution by the user. Users can lend, resell, or give away their copies of data and/or software, but they must lend/resell/give their authorizing disc to allow the use of the content. The user cannot distribute multiple copies after purchasing only a single copy.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, we see a diagram of authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a hybrid optical disc; that is, it includes both a mastered pre-recorded area, also known as a ROM portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a recordable area, also known as a RAM portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The disc includes a center hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for clamping and spinning. ROM portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a mastered session; that is, a master disc was created including supplied software or data in the first session, and was subsequently used, either directly or through intermediate &ldquo;Father&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mother&rdquo; discs-to stamp multiple uncustomized copies of the disc. Additional mastered sessions are also possible. RAM portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> can be of a write-once type (e.g. CD-WO or CD-R) or a rewriteable type (e.g. CD-RW), which can be written to by standard optical-disc writing techniques. Authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which is a digital signal recorded during the mastering process and subsequently impressed into ROM portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of each authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is recorded in such a way as to make it difficult for a pirate to copy, such as that disclosed in the above-cited, commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/772,333 filed Jan. 29, 2001, entitled &ldquo;Copy Protection Using a Preformed ID and a Unique ID on a Programmable CD-ROM&rdquo; by Barnard et al. ROM portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can include other information or programs that are common to all discs of a given application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In a part of RAM portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a second session or written session <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has been written by a content supplier or other authorized party prior to distribution. A content supplier is defined as a person or entity engaged in the production, sale, or resale of information content (e.g. audio, video, text, data, etc.) who wishes to use authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to make the content available to end users in a manner difficult to copy. The content supplier maintains the information content in its own databases and transfers information to end-users via a network (e.g. the Internet). Written session <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be a third or later session if authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> already includes more than one session. Written session <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a unique identification number or unique ID, also known as user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that is written in one or more known absolute sector addresses in an encrypted manner. User-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> serves to make each hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> unique for a specific user by virtue of the fact that each user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> written to the hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a unique combination of binary digits. User-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is also designed to be combined with preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to form a user-personalized secure signature. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can further include one or more additional written session(s) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that are written using recordable optical disc techniques, such as a CD-R, CD-WO, or CD-RW writer. This session can be written at any time after distribution of authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and can include an encrypted data package <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and an encrypted executable package <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can also include further writeable area <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which is the as-yet-unwritten part of RAM portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> By the term &ldquo;written in an encrypted manner&rdquo; we mean written in such a way that the contents are not clear to a reader who does not know how the data is stored. Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, we see schematic diagrams of several example methods of encryption. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows a substitution scheme in which the symbols of unique identification <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are replaced, on an individual basis or in blocks, with other symbols or groups of symbols <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>shows a simple hiding scheme in which unique identification <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is hidden among a longer series of symbols <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Its position and length must be known to effect decryption. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>shows a more complex hiding scheme in which the symbols of unique identification <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> are scrambled, either individually or in groups, and hidden among a larger series of symbols <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. This invention can use one or more of these or other schemes to write user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in an encrypted manner to RAM portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, we see one method of forming a user-personalized secure signature. Preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are concatenated to provide user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Turning next to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, we see a diagram of one way that encrypted client application package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be structured and written to authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use in this invention. Encrypted client application package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a single executable program with the same name on the disc as the original executable program. Encrypted client application package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes self-extracting software <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which runs first. It further includes anti-hacking routines <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to check for the presence of hacking software in memory when the program is run. It can further include a section with polymorphic data and/or commands <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Polymorphic code generally provides multiple paths which achieve the same results, but are constructed in such a way that a program follows a different path each time it executes. Polymorphic code is used to make the program more difficult to reverse-engineer. De-encrypting routines <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are designed to use the data stored on authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (specifically preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) to de-encrypt encrypted client application <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Encrypted client application package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> further includes a private keys area <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, which includes a set of private encryption keys that are used to verify the authenticity and integrity of authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a secure manner by utilizing public key encryption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, we see a block diagram of one method for making the optical discs to be used in this invention. A hybrid optical disc is mastered with preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and then used to manufacture a set of authorizing hybrid optical discs <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the same preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. All succeeding information transfers to the disc are by standard CD writer techniques. In step <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is generated for an individual authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is read from the disc (step <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>) and concatenated with user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to form user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, which also serves as the encryption key (step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>). User-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is used to uniquely encrypt the client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Encrypted client application <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is inserted into a previously-created ISO <highlight><bold>9660</bold></highlight>-compatible file image in step <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The main data channel of the session is modified with the user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>) and the entire package is written to authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as RAM portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. This has been described in detail in above-cited, commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/772,333 filed Jan. 29, 2001, entitled &ldquo;Copy Protection Using a Preformed ID and a Unique ID on a Programmable CD-ROM&rdquo; by Barnard et al. Authorizing hybrid optical discs <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can then be distributed in any manner (e.g. mailed, distributed through stores, etc.) Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, we see a schematic view of the way that user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is passed to a remote location in a secure manner in order to verify the authenticity of authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and subsequently to encrypt the desired content. This requires the use of a method which allows verification of the validity of authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by a remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> runs on an end-user&apos;s computer system, which is physically remote from remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, but is connected via network <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (e.g. the Internet). Remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> includes a method of encrypting and sending the desired content. Client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which is originally encrypted on authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as encrypted client application <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> within encrypted client application package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is designed to read preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in data read step <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and combine them into user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> sends a key request <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Included in key request <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is a message to use one of a plurality of keys from private keys area <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> when answering the request. Client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> returns user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> in signed message <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that has been signed with the selected private key. Remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> possesses the public key corresponding to the chosen private key, and can verify the authenticity of client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and therefore of authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, once it possesses user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, can encrypt the desired content. This will be further elaborated in what follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, we see a schematic of the private keys available in private keys area <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, their corresponding public keys, and how they are used between remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has been provided with a private key series <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which is stored in private keys area <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of encrypted client application package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. These private keys are capable of decrypting messages that have been encrypted with the corresponding public key, and they are also capable of signing messages in a secure way. For example, private key <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> (other private keys <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are also shown) can decrypt messages that have been encrypted with public key <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> (other public keys <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are also shown). Public key <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> can check the authenticity of messages signed by private key <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> includes a public key series <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of public keys corresponding to the private keys in private key series <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Public key series <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> can include the entire set of keys corresponding to private keys series <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, or can be a subset thereof. The latter arrangement allows certain keys to be maintained exclusively for one application or one vendor without modifying the client application. If the security of any key is compromised, that particular key can be removed from remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, and the security breach is thereby closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> randomly selects a public key &ldquo;X&rdquo; from public key series <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, making it selected public key <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> sends key request <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and indicates in key request <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which key has been selected to be selected public key <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> selects the corresponding private key from private key series <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to give the selected private key <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The selected public key <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>/selected private key <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> pair form public/private key channel <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> uses private key <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to sign signed message <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that is sent to remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, we see a schematic diagram showing the flow of data that occurs when a user requests new content. This content can be including program(s), audio, still, video, data files (e.g. lists, spreadsheets, reports, documents, presentation graphics, sales information), or combinations thereof. At user site <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>, preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are used to form user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. User-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is sent via network <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. At remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, plain content <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which is the unencrypted version of the content ordered by the user, is encrypted by encryption utility <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> using user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. This creates selected encrypted information <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Depending on the nature of plain content <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, selected encrypted information <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is either encrypted data package <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or encrypted executable package <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Because these are encrypted using user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> as the key, the user who possesses authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be able to use selected encrypted information <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Selected encrypted information <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is then downloaded via network <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to user site <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>. At user site <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>, selected encrypted information <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is written to memory location <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. In this example, memory location <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is additional written session <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in RAM portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The memory location can be any other location capable of storing digital content (e.g. a hard drive, a floppy disk, flash ROM, and others). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the nature of networks allows a plurality of users to simultaneously access remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and download content. Remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> receives the user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> for each particular user, encrypts plain content <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> with that particular user&apos;s user-personalized secure signature, and downloads the encrypted information <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to that particular user&apos;s memory location <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, we see a schematic diagram showing an alternative flow of data for delivering encrypted content to a user. In this embodiment, user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is filed at the content supplier&apos;s remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. At a request for content, plain content <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which is the unencrypted version of the content ordered by the user, is encrypted by encryption utility <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> using stored user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. This creates selected encrypted information <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Depending on the nature of plain content <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, selected encrypted information <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is either encrypted data package <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or encrypted executable package <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Because these are encrypted using user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> as the key, the user who possesses authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be able to use selected encrypted information <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Selected encrypted information <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can then be delivered to the registered user, for example via electronic mail message <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. This encryption/delivery method allows someone other than the user (e.g. a relative buying a gift) to purchase encrypted content for a given user. Depending on security considerations, a content supplier may or may not include this service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, we see a method by which the user, who is the holder of the disc, can obtain new content. In step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the user communicates with a content supplier via a network. The user can connect to an Internet site from his home, or can go to another place, such as a kiosk that sells and transfers this type of content. There are a number of means by which a user can achieve a connection with a content supplier. The content supplier&apos;s remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> can be accessible via a channel (e.g. a network, the Internet, etc.). The user can type in the address (e.g. an Internet URL) of the content supplier. Alternatively, authorized hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be encoded with a link that connects the user to remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, either automatically or by the user clicking on a link. The latter alternative removes the possibility of user error in typing a network address. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The user then selects content that he wishes to download (step <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>) and if necessary makes payment for the content (step <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>) via normal means of payment over a network (e.g. credit card payment over the Internet). The content can be a game, music, video, text such as a book, or any other type of downloadable information. The payment can be any normal means of making payment via a network. The user can transfer a payment number (e.g. a debit or credit card number) which authorizes a predetermined payment amount to the content supplier from the user&apos;s bank or other commercial institution. Another form the payment number can take is an authorization number from the content supplier which gives the user a number of downloads that has been predetermined (e.g. by prepayment from the user, promotional considerations of the content supplier, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Once the user has selected and paid for the desired content, the user places authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into a disc writer in step <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. A publicly accessible kiosk would be furnished with such a disc writer. If the user is at home, he must have an optical disc writer if memory location <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is in RAM portion <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> autolaunches or is selected (step <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>). Client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> reads preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>) and concatenates them into user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, which also serves as the decryption key (step <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>). A secure channel is established between client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>) and user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is provided to remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. (Step <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, if remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> determines that user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is invalid, or if it is missing, the process stops (step <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>). If user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is valid, the authorization for transfer is permitted and remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> encrypts plain content <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> using user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>). Encrypted information <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (embodied as encrypted data package <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or encrypted executable package <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) is transmitted to the writer (step <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>), where it is written to a new session (step <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>). This is known as an authorized transfer because the user has made payment and has been verified as possessing a valid authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Once the content is completely written, the contact is closed (step <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, we see a block diagram showing more details of the secure method for transmitting user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> randomly chooses selected public key <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> from public key series <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>, remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> sends key request <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to use public/private key channel <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> (i.e. the random key it has selected). Client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> formats user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> into a message (step <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>) which it then signs with selected private key <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>). Client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> then sends signed message <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>). Remote location <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> receives signed message <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and uses selected public key <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to verify signed message <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>). If signed message <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is not valid (step <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>), the process stops (step <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>). If signed message <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is valid, the process then continues (step <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Once the user has downloaded encrypted information <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in an authorized transfer, authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> serves to allow the user access to the encrypted information. Encrypted information <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be encrypted data (embodied as encrypted data package <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) or an encrypted executable program (embodied as encrypted executable package <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>). We first describe the user&apos;s access to the encrypted executable program. Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, we see a diagram of one way that encrypted executable package <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can be structured and written to authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use in this invention. Encrypted executable package <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is a single executable program with the same name on the disc as the original executable program. Encrypted executable package <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes self-extracting software <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which runs first. It further includes anti-hacking routines <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to check for the presence of hacking software in memory when the program is run.

In step <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, the end-user inserts authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into an optical disc drive (e.g. CD-ROM, CD-R, or CD-RW drive). Encrypted executable package <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> runs automatically or is selected (step <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>). The program first uses anti-hacking routines <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to check for hacking software that can be used to reverse-engineer the program and defeat copy-protection schemes (step <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>). If such reverse-engineering software is present, the anti-hacking routines display an error message to the user and stop automatically (step <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> If no such reverse-engineering software is present on the end-user&apos;s system, the de-encrypting routines <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> read preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, de-encrypting routines <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> read user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, de-encrypting routines <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> concatenate user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, which also serves as the decryption key. User-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is then used to decrypt encrypted executable <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>). The program then determines (step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>) if the decryption was valid. There are several ways of doing this, e.g. looking for a flag in the decrypted program or checking if operating-system-specific code is present in the decrypted executable. If the decryption was unsuccessful, an error message is displayed and the program-and the entire process-stops (step <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>). If the decryption was successful, the original executable is then started (step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> De-encrypting routines <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> remain in the background (step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>) while the program executes (step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>) and exits (step <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>). Once the original program exits, de-encrypting routines <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> clear the memory and hard-drive space used by the original program (step <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>) and then close down (step <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>). In this way, any decrypted form of the original executable is removed and only the encoded encrypted information (e.g. encrypted executable package <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>) remains in the user&apos;s memory location <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The authorization and decryption process is repeated each time the executable is started. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, we now describe one method to give the user access to encrypted data. This method passes a decryption key in a secure manner in order to decrypt encrypted data package <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Encrypted data package <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be constructed several ways. It can consist entirely of the encrypted information. In that case, supporting routines used for encrypted executable package <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (e.g. self-extracting software <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, anti-hacking routines <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) are not required. Encrypted data package <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can also be constructed to include the supporting routines. Encrypted data package <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be stored on authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as shown, or in another memory location on the user&apos;s system, such as the hard drive, compact flash, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Two applications that can communicate with each other in a secure manner are used on the same system. The first is the playback application or customer application <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which is a data-use program (e.g. a text reader, spreadsheet or presentation program, sound or video playback application) that includes a routine for decrypting encrypted data package <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, but does not include a decryption key. The decryption key is passed to it by the second application. The second application is the client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which is originally encrypted on authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is designed to read preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in data read step <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and combine them into user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, which also serves as the decryption key. Customer application <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> first sends a key request <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Included in key request <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is a message to use one of a plurality of keys from private keys area <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> when answering the request. Client application <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> returns user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to customer application <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in a signed message <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that has been signed with the selected private key. Customer application <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> possesses the public key corresponding to the chosen private key, and can verify the authenticity of client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and therefore of authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Customer application <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, once it possesses user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, can then read the encrypted data package <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (data read step <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>) and decrypt it. This will be further elaborated in what follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, we see a schematic of the private keys available in private keys area <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, their corresponding public keys, and how they are used between customer application <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has been provided with a private key series <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which is stored in private keys area <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of encrypted client application package <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. These private keys are capable of decrypting messages that have been encrypted with the corresponding public key, and they are also capable of signing messages in a secure way. For example, private key <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can decrypt messages that have been encrypted with public key <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. Public key <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> can check the authenticity of messages signed by private key <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Customer application <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a public key series <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of public keys corresponding to the private keys in private key series <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Public key series <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> can include the entire set of keys corresponding to private keys series <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, or can be a subset thereof. The latter arrangement allows certain keys to be maintained exclusively for one application or one vendor without modifying the client application. If the security of any key is compromised, that particular key can be removed from customer application <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and the security breach is thereby closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Customer application <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> randomly selects a public key &ldquo;X&rdquo; from public key series <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, making it selected public key <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Customer application <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> sends key request <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and indicates in key request <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which key has been selected to be selected public key <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> selects the corresponding private key from private key series <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to give the selected private key <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The selected public key <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>/selected private key <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> pair form public/private key channel <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> uses private key <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to sign signed message <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> that is sent to customer application <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

In this embodiment, encrypted data package <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is stored on authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the user inserts authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into an optical disc drive. Customer application <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> autoruns or is selected (step <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>). In step <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> autostarts or is launched. Customer application <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be the agent or requestor for launching client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> first checks to see if there is any hacking software running on the host machine (step <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>). Such software can be used to follow the steps that client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> uses, in an attempt to crack client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. If such software is running on the host machine, client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> stops (step <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>) and decryption of the data is not possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> If the host computer is determined to be safe, client application <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> reads preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and in step <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> concatenates the two IDs into user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, which also serves as the decryption key.

If the check fails, the decryption stops (step <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>) and no decrypted content is shown to the end-user. Presumably this is because the disc is counterfeit or damaged in some way. If the message is valid, customer application <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> uses user-personalized secure signature <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to decrypt encrypted data package <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, and then present it to the end-user (step <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> A creator of electronic computer games wishes to make the games available for downloading to customers. This creates a simple distribution model that can be achieved over a network <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> such as the Internet. However, the games creator wishes to restrict the distribution beyond the end user. The games creator can have an authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> manufactured. Each disc includes preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (which is unique to that set of discs) impressed in ROM portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Each disc also includes a unique user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The so-prepared discs can then be distributed by the games creator via any ordinary distribution means (e.g. by mail, at retail outlets that appeal to games players, cover-mounted to gaming magazines, etc.) to customers or potential customers. For example, the disc may be mailed to a customer upon the purchase of one of the available games, and includes the first game that the customer buys. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> For subsequent games, the user merely needs to connect to the games creator&apos;s website on the Internet and order the game(s) desired. The user pays for the games electronically. Via the techniques described herein, the games creator encrypts the desired games to the key of the user&apos;s authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and transmits the encrypted games to the user. At the user&apos;s location, the game can be stored on authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (if the user has an optical disc writer and sufficient space exists on authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>), or in another memory location, such as the user&apos;s hard drive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The game is an encrypted executable file that can use techniques similar to those described herein to run only if the user&apos;s authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is available in an optical disc reader on the user&apos;s system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In this scenario, the user is free to make copies of the downloaded games. For example, the user may wish to transfer some games to a laptop computer to make them accessible during a trip.

<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> A central corporate research library wishes to make confidential reports available for downloading to scientists who have clearance at a number of varied corporate locations. This creates a simple distribution model that can be achieved over a network <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> such as a corporate intranet. It is crucial to corporate security that the distribution of such reports be strictly limited to only those cleared. The library can have an authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> manufactured. Each disc includes preformed identification signature <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (which is unique to that set of discs) impressed in ROM portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Each disc also includes a unique user-specific encrypted information <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> To obtain reports, the scientist merely needs to connect to the library&apos;s website on the intranet and download the report(s) required. The library system can determine from authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> whether the scientist has clearance to the reports ordered. Via the techniques described herein, the publisher encrypts the reports to the key of the scientist&apos;s authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and transmits the encrypted reports to the scientist. At the scientist&apos;s location, the report can be stored on authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (if the scientist has an optical disc writer and sufficient space exists on authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>), or in another memory location, such as the scientist&apos;s hard drive. </paragraph>

Thus, someone else finding the file will not be able to read classified corporate information, as long as the scientist exercises caution with the &ldquo;key&rdquo; disc. The multiple layers of authentication and piracy checking mean that someone cannot easily make a pirated copy of authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, nor use other methods to obtain the access information and emulate authorizing hybrid optical disc <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Because the disc is keyed to a particular scientist, access can be turned off for a lost disc without affecting other scientists. </paragraph>
