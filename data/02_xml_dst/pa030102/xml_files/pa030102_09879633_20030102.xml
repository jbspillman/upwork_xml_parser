<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to chemicals that inhibit thermal runaway in batteries, including flame-retarding electrolytes, as well as a method for preparing and using them. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Batteries (often termed cells or electrochemical cells) are devices in which redox reactions occur at each of two electrodes separated by an ionically-conductive medium called an electrolyte, which can be either solid or liquid. During discharge, reduction occurs at the positive electrode (also called the cathode) and oxidation occurs at the negative electrode (known as the anode). Discharge is a spontaneous cell reaction where energy is released and can be used to supply power. During charging, voltage is supplied to the cell to store chemical energy at the electrodes. Primary batteries are those that cannot be recharged, i.e., used once and discarded. Secondary (commonly known as rechargeable) batteries involve chemically reversible reactions and can be recharged many times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Lithium has the lowest redox potential of all metals, is very light-weight, and is non-toxic in oxidized form. For these reasons, lithium has been widely studied and utilized as an anodic material. Lithium rechargeable batteries that use liquid non-aqueous electrolytes are now under intensive research because they exhibit enhanced properties, such as high ionic conductivity, high output voltage and increased capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Currently employed liquid non-aqueous electrolytes consist of two components: an organic solvent and a lithium ion source. A commonly used organic solvent is ethylene carbonate (&ldquo;EC&rdquo;) because of its low cost, good electrochemical stability, and high dielectric constant, which facilitates the dissolution of the lithium ion source and contributes to high ionic conductivities. Other carbonates, such as dimethyl carbonate (&ldquo;DMC&rdquo;) and propylene carbonate (&ldquo;PC&rdquo;) are often used in conjunction with EC to reduce viscosity, as well as to increase the wettability of the electrolytic solution with battery components, e.g., separator and electrodes. The lithium ion source is generally a salt with LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>being a preferred salt because of its ease of dissolution (ca. 1 M) in carbonates and low cost compared to that of fluorinated salts, such as CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>Li and (CF<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>SO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>NLi. Liquid electrolytes comprised of a EC-DMC mixture (1:1) and LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>exhibit ionic conductivities greater than 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>S/cm at room temperature, a prerequisite for reliable operations of lithium-ion batteries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Small lithium rechargeable batteries (also called lithium-ion batteries), which possess high energy density compared to other secondary batteries, are commercially available (with a capacity of 1300 to 1900 mAh) to power portable electronic devices such as cellular phones, camcorders, computers and cameras. Full size lithium-ion batteries are now under consideration for use in electric vehicles (EVs) to provide a longer driving range, higher acceleration, longer lifetime and a reduction in environmental pollution. Mass scale production of these batteries will be hampered until the safety-related issues, including controlling thermal runaway, are addressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For instance, under abusive conditions (e.g., shorting, crushing, or excessive over-charging) and occasionally under normal conditions (e.g., over-discharge, resistive and/or forced over-discharge), lithium-ion batteries that do not include safety features undergo thermal runaway. Thermal runaway is the condition where the rate of heat generation within a battery exceeds the battery&apos;s (and its operating environment&apos;s) capacity to dissipate the heat. This condition can cause accelerated dryout and increased charging current acceptance, which will eventually result in the battery igniting and/or exploding. In consumer oriented lithium-ion batteries, manufacturers employ external safety devices to minimize these potential hazards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These devices include smart charge control (to avoid over-charge), a poly-thermal switch (to respond to a temperature rise in the battery), current path interrupter (to respond to a rise in internal pressure), and an aluminum rupture disk (as an over-pressure disconnect). These safety devices are expensive and are not cost effective for use in EVs, in which large volumes of liquid electrolytes are required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Lithium rechargeable batteries also use another type of a non-aqueous electrolyte, a polymer-gel (often termed gel) electrolyte, in which comparatively less liquid electrolyte is used in a cross-linked polymer matrix. Because polymer-gel electrolyte requires less liquid, it reduces the magnitude of explosion or fire, but thermal runaway of the liquid electrolyte remains a critical concern. On the other hand, lithium rechargeable batteries containing a solid polymer electrolyte are comparatively safer, lighter in weight, more compact in size, and offer a more flexible design. Unfortunately, lithium polymer rechargeable batteries are not suitable for commercial production because of low ionic conductivities at room temperature. See e.g., Linden, D., Ed., Handbook of Batteries and Fuel Cells, McGraw-Hill, NY, 1995. Accordingly, there remains a need to provide safer electrolytes in batteries while maintaining high ionic conductivities. Such batteries require an electrolyte that inhibits, and preferably prohibits, thermal runaway and that is compatible with existing electrode and battery fabrication technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To improve the safety of these batteries, a number of approaches have been proposed. For example, Japanese Patent No. 7,192,762 discloses adding a halogenated formate ester to a nonaqueous electrolyte to decrease the flammability of the electrolyte. Further, European Application No. EP 0938151 discloses the use of a variety of fluorinated compounds in carbonate solvents to reduce the flammability of lithium battery electrolytes. U.S. Pat. No. 5,803,600 discloses the addition of certain compounds (e.g., phospholanes, cyclophosphazenes, silanes) to a variety of carbonates that generate CO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>upon decomposition, thereby reducing the flammability of battery electrolytes. Unfortunately, the foregoing approaches require very large quantities (e.g., 20-80% by weight) of the flame-retarding additives to ensure proper operation. U.S. Pat. No. 6,077,624 discloses reducing thermal runaway in vinylidene fluoride copolymer-based electrochemical cells by decreasing the number of reactive sites of the copolymer, which is effectuated through cross-linking the copolymer in order to selectively dehydroflorinate the vinylidine flouride units in the copolymer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> However, one problem is that none of the foregoing references teach commercially lithium-ion batteries of sufficient size and safety to power a variety of mechanical or electrical devices such as an EV. None of the references teach inhibiting thermal runaway by using a chemical interference mechanism via free radical scavenging and/or fire damping through flame resistant coatings. A further problem is that prior thermal runaway inhibitors were required to be present at relatively high percentages (e.g., 20-80% by weight) in the electrolyte. The present invention is provided to solve these and other problems. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of synthetic organic chemistry, electrochemistry, and polymer chemistry that are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. See e.g., Kirk-Otluner&apos;s <highlight><italic>Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology</italic></highlight>, Wade&apos;s <highlight><italic>Organic Chemistry </italic></highlight>(1999), Ege&apos;s <highlight><italic>Organic Chemistry: Structure and Reactivity </italic></highlight>(1994), March&apos;s <highlight><italic>Advanced Organic Chemistry </italic></highlight>(1992), Carey and Sundberg&apos;s <highlight><italic>Advanced Organic Chemistry </italic></highlight>(1990), or similar sources in the chemical literature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides for a battery comprising an anode and a cathode. The anode is an electrode where oxidation occurs and is comprised of carbonaceous materials, more preferably carbon black, active carbon, glassy carbon, or carbon fiber, and most preferably graphite. The cathode is another electrode where reduction occurs and is comprised of lithium transition metal oxide complexes, more preferably LiCoO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>or LiNiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and most preferably LiMn<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. The anode and cathode can also be of any kind known to one of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides for the battery to comprise an electrolyte having conductivity greater than about 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>S/cm at ambient temperature and which includes a compound that chemically interferes with flame propagation. The phrase &ldquo;chemically interferes with flame propagation&rdquo; is defined in one application as a chemical reaction in which an organic free radical reacts with and neutralizes other radicals, such as oxygen, which are required to sustain propagation of a flame. A second application of chemical interference with flame propagation involves fire damping by formation of a material that serves as a blanket to extinguish the fire. Thus, &ldquo;chemically interferes with flame propagation&rdquo; is a mechanism that comprises free radical scavenging and fire damping, and it is at least one of the mechanisms by which the compound is flame-retarding. The compound may comprise other mechanisms, including those heretofore described or a combination thereof. Preferably, the compound that chemically interferes with flame propagation is a radical scavenger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides that the compound that comprises the thermal runaway inhibitor has the general structure:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, X is either an oxygen or a sulfur atom, preferably oxygen. Additionally, R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are each independently selected from the group consisting of (a) C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to C<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>alkyl moieties that are terminally substituted with zero to three halogen atoms, preferably fluorine; (b) C<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>to C<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>aryl moieties substituted with zero to four alkyl, haloalkyl (preferably fluorine), or alkoxy moieties; and (c) trialkylsilyl moieties in which alkyl groups contain 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably methyl groups. The R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>moieties may be the same or different. Preferably, both R<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and R<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are ethyl groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides that Z is a moiety selected from the group consisting of aryl, aralkylene, dialkylamino, diarylamino, alkylarylamino, trialkyleneamino, cyclic amino, cyclic amido, cyclic imido, and oxy derivatives thereof. What is meant by oxy derivative in this instance is that the Z moiety is bound to the phosphorus atom through a single oxygen atom. Further, Z can also be a trialkylalkyleneoxysilane moiety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides that Z may be an aryloxy moiety as defined above. One example of an aryloxy group is a phenyl-containing moiety, specifically phenoxy, and more specifically 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenoxy. A possible oxy derivative of an aryl would be, but is not limited to, a moiety derived from substituted or unsubstituted phenol. Accordingly, the present invention provides that two possible examples of a compound that interferes with flame propagation are diethyl(2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenyl)phosphate and diethylphenylthiophosphate. The present invention also contemplates that Z may be a moiety of an aryl, arylene, or aralkylene group. Examples of suitable aryl moieties include phenyl; 4-methylphenyl; 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenyl; 2-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenyl; 3-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenyl, and 3-pyridyl. Suitable aralkylene moieties are 4-methylbenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, and the like. Suitable arylene moieties are phenylene, pyridylene, and the like. Suitable aralkylene moieties are 1,4-dimethylbenzene and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As stated above, the present invention also provides that Z may be a cyclic imido moiety, which may be selected from the group consisting of succinimidyl and glutarimidyl, though other cyclic imido moieties are possible provided that the resulting compound chemically interferes with flame propagation or is flame-retarding through another mechanism. Non-limiting examples of the present invention comprising a cyclic imido moiety are diethylphosphorosuccinimidate and diethyl-N-succinimidylphosphate. The latter example is an instance where Z is bound to the phosphorus atom with an oxy linkage, namely an oxy derivative of a succinimidyl referred to as O-succinimidyl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides that Z may be a moiety of a diarylamino group, suitable examples of which include diphenylamino and bis(4-methylphenyl)amino. When the diphenylamino group is selected as Z, a possible resulting compound is a diethylphosphorodiphenylamidate. Of course, the actual identity of the compound in an example given herein will depend on the chosen identities of X, R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and Z. The present invention contemplates that the R<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, R<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and Z moieties may contain substituents. Suitable substituents include but are not limited to: alkyl, haloalkyl (preferably fluoroalkyl), alkoxy, halogens, aryl, and any combination thereof. The present invention also contemplates that both aryl groups of Z may be replaced with alkyl groups, resulting in Z comprising a dialkylamino moiety such as dimethylamino or diethylamino. Of course, if only one aryl group of Z is replaced, Z then comprises an alkylarylamino moiety such as methylphenylamino or ethylphenylamino). </paragraph>

A specific example of where Z is a cyclic amino moiety is the compound diethyl-3-pyridylphosphate, though other examples are certainly possible through the substitution of a different cyclic amino moiety. The present invention further provides that Z may be a cyclic amido moiety. Suitable examples include, but are not limited to, 2-imidazolidinonyl, 2-pyrrolidinono, and 2-piperidinono. </paragraph>

What is meant by oxy derivative in this instance is that the common Z linkage is bound to each of the two functional groups through a single oxygen atom.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As with the above-described embodiments, X is an oxygen atom or a sulfur, preferably oxygen. The R moiety is again selected from the group consisting of (a) C<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>to C<highlight><subscript>12 </subscript></highlight>alkyl terminally substituted with zero to three halogen (preferably fluorine) atoms; (b) C<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>to C<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>aryl moieties substituted with zero to four alkyl, haloalkyl (preferably fluoroalkyl), or alkoxy moieties; and trialkylsilyl moieties in which alkyl groups contain 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably methyl groups.

What is meant by oxy derivative in this instance is that the Z<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>or Z<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>moiety is bound to the phosphorus atom through a single oxygen atom. Further Z<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>or Z<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>can also be a trialkylalkyleneoxysilane moiety. The Z<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>moiety may be the same or different as the Z<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>moiety in the compound. In this instance, the oxy derivative is where Z<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>or Z<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, or both, are bound to the phosphorus atom through a respective oxygen atom. Accordingly, in one particular embodiment where Z<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and Z<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are both succinimidyl groups, and where R is ethyl group, the resulting compound is ethylphosphorodi-N-succinimidate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides for a method for synthesizing the compounds that comprise the thermal runaway inhibitors. Although described at this juncture, a more detailed description follows in the experimental disclosure. The first step of the method comprises providing a first starting material selected from the group consisting of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol; phenol; triethanolamine; N-hydroxysuccinimide; 2-imidazolidone; 3-hydroxypyridine; diphenylamine, and succinimide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The next step of the method is mixing the starting material with a sufficient amount of an organic solvent in which the starting material is essentially soluble to form a solution. In one preferred embodiment, the organic solvent is tetrahydrofuran (THF), and is preferably dried before use. It should be noted that any organic solvent is possible, provided that the starting material is essentially soluble in the organic solvent to form a solution. What is meant by essentially soluble is that more than 50% of the starting material is soluble in amount of chosen solvent for the reaction at ambient temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The third step of the method comprises mixing the solution with a base to generate the salt of the starting material, thereby forming a first reaction mixture. Any base that generates the salt of the starting material is adequate. A preferred base is sodium hydride or butyl lithium. Preferably, the solution and the base are mixed at a temperature below ambient temperature, preferably at least 0&deg; C. if the base is sodium hydride and at least &minus;50&deg; C. if the base is butyl lithium. After the first reaction mixture is formed, the next step comprises adjusting the temperature of the first reaction mixture to produce a first chemical reaction. In a preferred embodiment, the first reaction mixture is heated to about 50&deg; C. for at least four, and preferably six hours. Again, it is an object of the first chemical reaction to form a salt of the first starting material so that it can react with a second starting material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The method next provides for adding a second starting material selected from the group consisting of dialkylhalophosphate, dialkyl(chloromethyl)phosphonate, dialkylhalothiophosphate, and diarylhalophosphate to the first reaction mixture to form a second reaction mixture. According to a preferred form of the method, the dialkylhalophosphate is dialkylchlorophosphate, the dialkylhalothiophosphate is dialkylchlorothiophosphate, and the diarylhalophosphate is diarylchlorophosphate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the second starting material is dissolved in a second organic solvent, which is the same as the first organic solvent, and is added dropwise to the first reaction mixture. The first reaction mixture is preferably cooled to about 0&deg; C. before the addition of the second starting material. In a preferred embodiment, the second organic solvent is dry THF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The next step is adjusting the temperature of the second reaction mixture to produce a second chemical reaction between the second starting material and the salt of the first starting material. According to a preferred embodiment, the second reaction mixture is heated to about 50&deg; C. for eighteen hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The final step is removing the organic solvent, and any unreacted second starting material to produce a thermal runaway inhibitor. The organic solvent can be removed by any method known generally including vacuum distillation, rotary evaporation, and the like. According to one embodiment, the method further comprises washing the thermal runaway inhibitor with a third organic solvent, more preferably ether, and removing the third organic solvent by any known means. Optionally, the TRI can be purified by column chromatography using a stationary phase (silica gel or alumina) and an appropriate eluent such as chloroform and THF. The chromatographic technique is especially essential when the TRI possesses a very high boiling point or decomposes during distillation. Optionally, both the starting materials can be reacted neat or in solution in the presence of a catalyst or a base. A catalyst can be selected from nickel or palladium halide. A base can be an amine, such as pyridine and triethylamine, which can be a part of a cross-linked polymer network, e.g., basic ion-exchange resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Thus, upon completion of the method, thermal runaway inhibitors are produced. According to specific embodiments of the method, some examples of thermal runaway inhibitors are: diethyl(2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenyl)phosphate; diethylphosphorosuccinimidate; bis(N-succinimidyl)-ethylphosphonimide; diethylphenylthiophosphate; benzene-1,4-bis-diethylphosphate; triethanolamino-tris-diethylphosphate; diethyl-N-succinimidylphosphate; N,N&prime;-bis(diethylphosphoro)imidazolidone; diethyl-3-pyridylphosphate; diethylphosphorodiphenylamidate, and ethylphosphorodi-N-succinimidate. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Evaluation of the TRIs </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Once the foregoing compounds were synthesized, their ability to comprise a suitable flame-retarding electrolyte was investigated. The standard reference, hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;standard electrolyte&rdquo;, was prepared as 1.0 M LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>(available commercially from Aldrich) in an EC-DMC (1:1) solvent mixture. Each TRI comprising a flame-retarding electrolyte was prepared in accord with the following composition: LiPF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>(1.0 M) (Aldrich) in EC-DMC (1:1) solvent mixture containing varying amounts of the respective TRI, from about greater than 0% to about 50% by weight, more preferably from about from about 0. 10% to about 15% by weight, and most preferably from about 0.50% to about 5.0% by weight. The present invention contemplates that mixtures of TRIs may be employed and may achieve further synergistic effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the electrochemical stability of the flame-retarding electrolytes was investigated by cyclic voltammetry. Specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) shows the standard electrolyte; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) shows that of 1.6% by weight of diethyl(2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenyl)phosphate in the standard electrolyte; and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) shows that of 2.0% by weight of triethanolamino-tris-diethylphosphate in the standard electrolyte. All of the electrolytes, included those not depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, exhibited very good electrochemical stability comparable with the standard electrolyte, exhibiting an oxidative stability about 4.5 volts better than lithium. The cyclic voltammograms were obtained in a three-electrode cell under an argon atmosphere. The electrodes were glassy carbon as the working electrode, platinum as the counter electrode, and lithium as the reference electrode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Also investigated were the conductivities of the flame-retarding electrolytes, as measured in a conductivity cell using the AC impedance method. See e.g., Lee et al., <highlight><italic>Electrochemical and Solid</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>State Letters, </italic></highlight>3(2), 63-65 (2000); Linden, D., Ed., <highlight><italic>Handbook of Batteries and Fuel Cells</italic></highlight>, McGraw-Hill, NY, (1995); and Bard and Faulkner, <highlight><italic>Electrochemical Methods: Fundamentals and Applications</italic></highlight>, John Wiley, New York, (1980), for detailed descriptions of standard electrochemical characterization methods, such as cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance method. All flame-retarding electrolyte compositions showed ionic conductivities near that for the standard electrolyte (3&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;3 </superscript></highlight>S/cm), indicating no diminution in conductivities due to the presence of a TRI in the electrochemical cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Regarding the flammability of flame-retarding electrolytes, two different tests were employed. The first technique was differential scanning calorimetry (&ldquo;DSC&rdquo;) in which samples of electrolytes were heated (10&deg; C./min) with and without lithium to expose potential thermal hazards associated with the electrolyte either by itself or in contact with materials likely to be present in a cell. That is, a standard electrolyte containing a TRI and a small piece of lithium metal were sealed in a standard aluminumDSC pan. Scans were carried out at aheatingrate of 10&deg; C./min from 30&deg; C. to 300&deg; C. under argon purge. The first endothermic peak at 180&deg; C., which is present in all the tests, was assigned to the melting of lithium metal, and is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). The major exothermic peak, which corresponds to the reaction between lithium and electrolyte at 225&deg; C., was very prominent for the standard electrolyte alone, but much less so for those containing flame-retarding additives, as is evidenced in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). What the DSC results demonstrate is that the addition of the flame-retardant additive significantly reduces the exothermic reactions at higher temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> The second technique was accelerated rate calorimetry (&ldquo;ARC&rdquo;). The ARC is an adiabatic calorimeter in which heat evolved from the test sample is used to raise the sample temperature. ARC is conducted by placing a sample (in this case, an electrolyte) in a sample bomb inside an insulating jacket. In an ARC analysis, the sample is heated to a pre-selected initial temperature for a period of time to achieve thermal equilibrium. A search is then conducted to measure the rate of heat gain (&ldquo;self-heating&rdquo;) of the sample. If the rate of self-heating is less than a preset rate after the programmed time interval (typically 0.02&deg; C./min), the sample temperature is stopped by a new value, and the heat-wait-search sequence is repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Once a self-heating rate greater than the present value is measured, the heat-wait-search sequence is abandoned; the only heating supplied to the calorimeter thereafter is that required to maintain the adiabatic condition between the sample and the jacket. Heat generated from the reaction inside the sample increases its temperature and pressure, thereby increasing the rate of the reaction. See e.g., Townsend et al. <highlight><italic>Thermochim. Acta </italic></highlight>37:1 (1980). This technique provides information for thermal hazard evaluation, material handling procedures, and can provide additional information on the energies of activation, storageability, and other fundamental thermokinetic parameters that are not available using other techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the ARC test provides an accurate measure of thermal runaway characteristics under extreme conditions. The maximum self-heat rate of the standard electrolyte is 0.687&deg; C./min, which occurs at 178&deg; C., is shown if <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). This observation can be attributed to the reaction of lithium metal with the electrolyte. Moderate heat development was also discerned for the standard electrolyte at a higher temperature range (beginning at 215&deg; C.) due to exothermic decomposition. Most importantly, the electrolytes containing the TRIs exhibited only one narrow and low self-heating region, as is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) and (<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). Specifically, the electrolyte having diethyl(2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenyl)phosphate exhibited a maximum self-heating rate of 0.254&deg; C./min at 189&deg; C.; the electrolyte having triethanolamino-tris-diethylphosphate exhibited a maximum self-heating rate of 0.047&deg; C./min at 189&deg; C.; and the electrolyte having ethylphosphorodi-N-succinimidate exhibited a maximum self-heating rate of 0.162&deg; C./min at 200&deg; C. Also noteworthy is a shift of the peak for the self-heating rate towards higher temperatures. These important observations distinguish these compounds as functionally superior to other reported flame-retarding additives. The reductions and shifts in self-heat rates of the TRIs significantly improve the nonflammability of current electrolyte systems without affecting existing lithium-ion battery technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Next investigated was the effect of the TRIs on the electrochemical performance of standard lithium coin cells known in the art as graphite/LiNi<highlight><subscript>0.8</subscript></highlight>Co<highlight><subscript>0.2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, which is also referred to as type 2016. The coin cells were comprised of a cathode, an anode, a separator and an electrolyte based on the current state-of-the-art lithium-ion cells. Specifically, the cathode was 84% LiCo<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>Ni<highlight><subscript>1-x</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(where x&equals;0.2 or 0.8)&plus;6% by weight acetylene black&plus;10% by weight polyvinylidenedifluoride (&ldquo;PVDF&rdquo;). The anode was 89% graphite&plus;11% by weight PVDF. The separator was polyethylene, and the electrolyte was the standard electrolyte described above or further comprising a TRI described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The capacity of the cells was determined under the same current regimes. The charge and discharge capacities of the cell containing TRI show an excellent performance, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>)-(c). No detrimental effect of the TRI was found in the electrochemical behavior of the lithium-ion coin cells. Finally, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> exhibits the cycling behavior of the LiNi<highlight><subscript>0.8</subscript></highlight>Co<highlight><subscript>0.2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>coin cells with the electrolyte containing a TRI, which shows excellent capacity retention after 17 cycles with no detrimental effect on the cell during cycling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> The present invention contemplates that the thermal runaway inhibitors may be used in one or more electrochemical cells (such as a battery), which may or may not be operatively connected either in series or in parallel with one or more electrochemical cells, to power an apparatus. A example is where a battery system is comprised of a first battery having a compound that chemically interferes with flame propagation operatively connected to a second battery having a compound that chemically interferes with flame propagation. The compounds that chemically interfere with flame propagation may be the same in both (or more) batteries in the system, but need not be for operation. Further, because the present invention allows for much safer electrolytes to be incorporated in larger cells and batteries than previously possible, the list of equipment and devices that could employ the invention comprise EVs, automobiles, motorcycles, motor homes, trucks, boats, or any apparatus that is motor-driven. The present invention may also be used in smaller electronic components such as, but not limited to, computers, cellular telephones, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> While the specific embodiments have been illustrated and described, numerous modifications come to mind without significantly departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of protection is only limited by the scope of the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
