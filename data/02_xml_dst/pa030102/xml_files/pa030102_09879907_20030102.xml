<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention relates to a third brake inner indicating light device, especially one indicating distance of rear objects while backing a car. The present invention mainly comprises a third brake light, a projector and a receiver. The third brake light is connected to the receiver and is designed with an indicating screen at the back. The projector is found at the top of the bumper and connected to the receiver such that a short range electric wave is emitted while backing a car. The receiver is found inside the baggage compartment, is separately connected to the third brake light and the projector and warms the driver of any rear obstacles by means of letters, signals or diagrams after receiving signal from the projector. The present invention hence increases backing car safely. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a third brake inner indicating light device, especially one indicating distance of rear objects while backing a car. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">INVENTION BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Commonly used third brake lights are found at the back of a car and are usually activated when applying the brakes. The third brake light is generally found at the back window screen and the back shell can be clearly seen while backing a car. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a safer environment by adding an indicating screen at the back shell of the third brake light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The rear lights as well as the third brake light are usually illuminated while a car is backing. Hence, it would be much safer if a car radar could be added to warm the driver of road conditions within a limited range by using an indicating screen designed at the back shell of the third brake light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is generally quite difficult to back a car at night or during bad weather conditions and dangerous if there are any infants or lifeless objects on the way. Further, the backing sound signal should be eliminated as it is sometimes even more dangerous and very noisy. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention of a third brake inner indicating light device, an indicating screen is designed to warm the driver of rear objects or distance while backing a car by means of letters, signals or diagrams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention of a third brake inner indicating light device, a projector and a receiver are connected to the third brake light. The projector is activated while backing a car and emits a short range electric-wave such that a reaction wave of any rear objects will be received by the receiver and projected in the third brake inner indicating screen.</paragraph>
