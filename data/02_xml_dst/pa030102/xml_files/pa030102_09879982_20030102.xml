<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A plurality of magnetic sensors are provided in a magneto motor to sense variations of rotating poles of rotor magnets. One of the magnetic sensors is provided to let the exciting current of stator coils and the rotating poles of the rotor interchange orthogonally, and the others are provided to let the exciting current of the stator coils and the rotating poles of the rotor interchange non-orthogonally.

<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> wherein E is the counter electromotive force voltage (volt), T is the output torsion (N&minus;m), K<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>is the counter electromotive force coefficient, K<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>is the torsion coefficient, &OHgr; is the rotation speed of the armature (rad/sec), I<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>is the armature current (ampere), B is the magnetic flux density of the gap (gauss), D is the outer diameter of the armature (cm), L is the superimposed thickness (cm), and Z is the total number of turns of conductors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from the above formulas, the counter electromotive force coefficient K<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>equals the torsion coefficient K<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>, and the counter electromotive force coefficient K<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>is inversely proportional to the rotation speed of the armature &OHgr;. Therefore, for a fixed counter electromotive force voltage E, if the normal rated rotation speed of the armature is lower, the value of the counter electromotive force coefficient K<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>will be relatively higher, while if the normal rated rotation speed of the armature is higher, the value of the counter electromotive force coefficient K<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>will be relatively lower. If a motor is designed to have a higher normal rated rotation speed of the armature, the value of the torsion coefficient K<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>will be relatively lower so that the torsion T (T&equals;K<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>&middot;I<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>) can only be increased with a higher armature current I<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>if the motor is operated at a lower rotation speed. If a motor is designed to have a higher torsion coefficient K<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>, the motor will not accomplish a higher normal rated rotation speed because K<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>&equals;K<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>and E&equals;K<highlight><subscript>E</subscript></highlight>&middot;&OHgr;. The present invention can let a motor have a higher torsion coefficient K<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>. Moreover, the present invention can switch to magnetic sensors sensing angle in advance to let the armature of the motor generate the effect of weak magnetic control, hence reducing the magnetic flux density of the armature gap. From the above formulas K<highlight><subscript>E</subscript></highlight>&equals;B&middot;D&middot;L&middot;Z/2 and E&equals;K<highlight><subscript>E</subscript></highlight>&middot;&OHgr;, because the magnetic flux density B of the armature gap decreases, the counter electromotive force coefficient K<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>consequentially decreases. Therefore, the rotation speed of the armature, &OHgr;, will inevitably increase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The torsion coefficient K<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>of a prior art motor is a single value. For a motor usually operating in the range of lower rotation speeds and sometimes operating in the range of higher rotation speeds (e.g., a light electric vehicle), to let the motor operate in the seldom work range of the highest rotation speed when necessary, because K<highlight><subscript>E</subscript></highlight>&equals;K<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>, E&equals;K<highlight><subscript>E</subscript></highlight>&middot;&OHgr;, and T&equals;K<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>&middot;I<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>, the torsion coefficient K<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>and the counter electromotive force coefficient K<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>must decrease to increase the rotation speed &OHgr; to the seldom work range of the highest rotation speed if the counter electromotive force voltage E is fixed. Because the torsion coefficient K<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>decreases, and the motor usually operates in the range of lower rotation speeds, the armature current I<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>must increase to increase the torsion T because T&equals;K<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>&middot;I<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>. However, a too large I<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>is not good to the operational efficiency of the motor. This can be known from the following formula.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> wherein P is the dissipated power of the coil of an electromotor, I is the armature current, and R is the impedance of the coil. Therefore, if the torsion of a motor is increased by increasing the armature current, the dissipated power of the stator coil will increase squarely, and heat will be generated in the impedance of the coil. The impedance of the coil will correspondingly rise due to the temperature rise of the metallic coil. This vicious circle will let the motor operate in an environment of high temperature, hence resulting in a worse output efficiency. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A stator portion of a conventional motor is formed by winding a single coil. Therefore, the torsion coefficient K<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>and the counter electromotive force coefficient K<highlight><subscript>E </subscript></highlight>thereof are consequentially constant values. If a motor is designed to have higher values of the K<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>and K<highlight><subscript>E</subscript></highlight>, the rotation speed &OHgr; of the armature will decrease proportionally. In the present invention, a plurality of magnetic sensors are provided in a magneto motor to sense the variation of rotating poles of rotor magnets, and at least a magnetic sensor is provided at the position letting the switching angle of the exciting current of stator coils be not orthogonal to the rotating poles of the rotor. Signals sensed by the non-orthogonal switching sensors are outputted to a motor driving and control circuit, which let the exciting current of the stator coils of the motor generate the effect of weak magnetic control, hence increasing the rotation speed of the rotor. The above weak magnetic control device capable of increasing the rotation speed of a motor when necessary can let the motor use magnetic sensors which switch angles with normal exciting current to have a larger value of the torsion coefficient K<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>. When a motor of larger K<highlight><subscript>T </subscript></highlight>value operates at lower rotation speeds, because the armature current I<highlight><subscript>a </subscript></highlight>can be decreased proportionally (T&equals;K<highlight><subscript>T</subscript></highlight>&middot;I<highlight><subscript>a</subscript></highlight>), the dissipated power of the stator coils of the motor will also decrease (P&equals;I<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&middot;R), thereby reducing the working temperature of the motor and increasing the operational efficiency of the motor operating at lower rotation speeds. </paragraph>
