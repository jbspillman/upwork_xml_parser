<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a composition for treating hypertension and lowering cholesterol and a method for preparing same. More specifically, the present invention relates to a composition for treating hypertension and lowering cholesterol which contains the mixed extract of <highlight><italic>Pana notoginseng </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic></highlight>as an active ingredient, and a method for preparing same. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Cardiac and vascular diseases are one of the main causes of human death, and are represented by cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis, heart failure, cardiac infarction, etc. However, etiology of such diseases is very diverse and complex. The target for treatment of hypertension is to prevent the occurrence of complications in brain, heart, kidney, liver, etc., thereby allowing the human to manage a normal life by the average life span. The development of drugs for treatment of hypertension is still urgently required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Blood pressure and hypertension will be more specifically explained hereinbelow. The term, blood pressure, denotes a pressure of blood stream flowing through blood vessels, i.e., arterial pressure. In this context, the term, hypertension, means that a certain cause induces an increase of resistance on the internal wall of blood vessel thus resulting in the maximum blood pressure (systolic blood pressure or highest blood pressure) of 150-160 mmHg and the minimum blood pressure (diastolic blood pressure or lowest blood pressure) of 90 mmHg or more. The former is called a systolic hypertension and the latter is called a diastolic hypertension. Although both may separately arise, it is general that they are simultaneously present. Moreover, hypertension may occur in the thirties, but it mainly occurs during the pre- and post-climacteric period in men rather than women. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> According to etiology, hypertension can be classified into essential hypertension and symptomatic hypertension. Although the cause of essential hypertension is not fully clarified as yet, essential hypertension occurs in many cases of fatty persons having a potent genetic predisposition. However, essential hypertension may also be observed in many cases of otherwise persons This essential hypertension is closely related to arteriosclerosis. In this context, it appears that hypertension may result in arteriosclerosis rather than arteriosclerosis which is the cause of hypertension. In case of essential hypertension, blood pressure is fluctuated at the early stage and then is maintained at a high level when artery is hardened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Symptomatic hypertension arises from other cause and is mainly induced by renal diseases, particularly acute nephritis, toxemia of pregnancy, climacteric disorders, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In many cases, hypertension at the early stage does not develop any symptom and is accidentally revealed through measurement of blood pressure. When hypertension is progressed, various subjective symptoms such as headache, anxiety, fatigue, vertigo, palpitation, excitation and constipation are developed and blood pressure is greatly fluctuated. In a chronic state of disease, hypertrophic extension of left ventricle, coronary artery disorders, heart failure, etc. are progressed to either cause congestive heart failure or cardiac infarction, which may lead to death, or to cause change in a renal artery and resultant nephrosclerosis which may be a culprit of renal failure such as polyuria, night polyuria, proteinuria, etc., the patient of which may lead to death because of uremia. Other complications such as arteriosclerosis on eyeground, aneurysm etc., may also be developed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although the cause of hypertension is very diverse, hypertension stems generally from hyperergasia of sympathetic nerve, abnormality of hormone secretion, abnormality of renal artery, etc. Thus, spontaneous hypertension is concerned with at least three or more genes, upon which environmental factors such as excess ingestion of salts or stress act to induce hypertension. In the early stage of disease, the neurological factors play an important role and the disease is progressed by factors including abnormalities of metabolism and structure of blood vessels. If hypertension is persisted, the contraction of artery is fixed, plasma norepinephrine is reduced, and collagen and non-collagen metabolism in cardiovascular system is accelerated, thereby fixing the state of hypertension. A change in the lining of blood vessel to support the elevated pressure thereof affects the blood flow toward heart and kidney thus increasing the mortality due to diseases in circulatory system such as arteriosclerosis, cardiac infarction, cerebral stroke, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The study of hypertension has been actively and continuously conducted with a medical concern in an effort to induce development of several therapeutic agents from about 40 years ago. However, the prior therapeutic agents have many problems due to continuous medication and therefore, a satisfactory therapeutic agent for hypertension has not been developed as yet. It has been reported that hypertension can be preferably treated by means of a combination of two or three different kinds of hypotensive agents. By way of example, it is preferred that a drug having hypotensive effect is used, while another drug having different hypotensive mechanism is administered, to reduce any possible side effect of the drug as first used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Side effects, which may be caused by currently used hypotensive agents are as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Diuretic-based antihypertensive agents have a tendency to induce hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, glycosemia, hyperlipidemia, sexual function disturbance, hyperkalemia, etc., whereas sympatholytic hypotensive agents may induce sexual function disturbance, thirst, depression, orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia, asthma, heart failure, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Vasodilating hypotensive agents show tachycardia, arrhythmia, asthenia, polyuria, suffusion, headache, bradycardia, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In addition, angiotensin II inhibitors show side effects such as rapid decrease in renal function, uremia, heart failure, etc., and agents for blocking 5-HT receptor may induce headache, dry mouth, nausea, vertigo, eruption, pruritus, cacogeusia, pyrexia, leukocytopenia, kidney failure, arthralgia, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The effectiveness of recently developed Ca<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> antagonists has been substantially established. It has been revealed, however, that they have side effects such as inhibition of cardiac function due to myocardial contraction, and further that Ca<highlight><superscript>2&plus;</superscript></highlight> participates in insulin secretion mechanism to induce disorder of insulin secretion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thus, the use of many therapeutic agents for hypertension accompanies a serious practical problem due to such side effects. In addition, in controlling the blood pressure, if any one side is inhibited, the other side may be accelerated to induce a new unbalance of hypertension. By way of example, the administration of diuretic-based hypotensive agent may lower water or sodium factors and on the other hand, accelerate rennin-angiotensin system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The blood pressure is maintained in a competitive manner by factors conflicting with each other. However, the effect following administration of hypotensive agents is substantially unsatisfactory to treat hypertension and, if any resistance to the drug is raised, an antagonistic factor at any one side may be accelerated. Therefore, when two or more hypotensive agents are used together, it is preferred that the mechanism thereof be different from each other. Preferred agents for treatment of hypertension should improve blood flow in tissues and organs by preventing any possible disorder of the target organ and controlling blood pressure, maintain blood pressure within the normal range, and have substantially no toxicity and side effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile, <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>NEES, which is one of medicinal herbs, is a perennial herbal plant belonging to Araliaceae and contains approximately 4% of saponin aglycons (Ginsenosides Ro, a, b1, b2, c, d, e, f, g1, g2, h). Aglycon of ginsenoside Ro is oleanolic acid; aglycon of ginsenosides Rb1, b2, c and d is 20-s-protopanaxadiol; and aglycon of ginsenosides Re, g1 and g2 is 20-s-protopanaxtriol. In addition, <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>also contains, &bgr;-sitosterol, &bgr;-sitosteryl-glucoside,panaxynol (1,9-cis)-heptadecadiene-4,6-dyen-3-ol), vitamin B group, choline, etc., and further, about 1.5% of monosaccharides, and disaccharides, trisaccharides, etc. None of components contained in <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>has been known to have pharmacological activities, except that it has been reported that aglycons have hypotensive activity in animals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Since <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>tends to exhibit hemostatic activity, it has been used for hematemesis or rhinorrhagia, and further stimulates the function of brain by acting on central nervous system. In addition, it has been known that <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>exhibits hypotensive activity, dilation of heartbeat and increase in coronary blood flow, while showing lipidolysis activity in blood and activating immune function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Another medicinal herb, <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic></highlight>BUNGE belonging to Labiatae is a perennial herbal plant spontaneously growing in fields and mountains on the northeast area of China. It has been known that <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic></highlight>BUNGE contains phenanthraquinone-based pigment including tanshinone I purplish brown (I), tanshinine II red (II), cryptotanshinone orange (III), and other tanshinol I, II. However, it has not been disclosed as yet that any of these components exhibits pharmacological activities. Merely known is that the aqueous extract of <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic></highlight>BUNGE has some inhibitory activity against various dermatomycosis. In the filed of Chinese medicine, it has been used for treating dysmenorrhea, menorrhalgia, menopause or postpartal abdominal pain. In this context, it is supposed that phenanthraquinone-based pigment materials are highly possible to take part in endocrine system in view of their chemical structures and are also concerned with disturbance of blood circulation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have found that the combined use of two kinds of medicinal herbs, i.e. <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic></highlight>has far greater effect of lowering blood pressure than the independent use of the respective herbal plants and have completed the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above-mentioned purposes of the present invention, a composition for treating hypertension and lowering cholesterol level, which contains the mixed extract of <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic></highlight>as an active ingredient is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The composition of the present invention can be formulated into the composition selected from the group consisting of tablets, capsules, solutions, suspensions, syrups and edible beverages, by further incorporating a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It is preferred that the mixed medicinal herb extract of the present invention is an aqueous extract or an alcoholic extract. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the mixture of <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza, </italic></highlight>the mixing ratio thereof is preferably 5:1 to 1:5, and more preferably 2:1 to 1:2, on the basis of weight. If the mixing ratio is beyond the above-specified range, the synergistic effect derived from the mixed extract is low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The dosage of the mixed extract of <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic></highlight>is preferably 10 to 40 mg per 1 kg of the body weight of an adult man. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In addition, the present invention provides a method for preparing the composition for treating hypertension and lowering cholesterol level, which comprises the steps of: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a novel pharmaceutical composition containing the extract of the mixture composed of medicinal herbal plants including <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza. </italic></highlight>The extract has no pathological or physiological influence upon normal tissues and functions thereof, and has an effect of activating the function to maintain the homeostasis of blood pressure by participating in the mechanism of controlling blood pressure. However, the use of only one of <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic></highlight>provides no expectable hypotensive effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The hypotensive effect of the composition according to the present invention could be confirmed by experiments using animals suffering from genetically induced hypertension, namely, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Currently used antihypertensive agents control hypertension in the manner of symptomatic treatment whereas the composition of the present invention lowers blood pressure by exhibiting CNS inhibitory activity and a potent sedative effect, and at the same time, secondarily inhibiting sympathetic nerve to interfere the entrance of hypertensive substances such as noreinephrine, serotonin and hypertensin into the reservoir. Further, the composition of the present invention also induces the expression of antagonistic substances against hypertensive hormones released from posterior lobe of hypophysis, decreases the resistance of peripheral blood vessel and exhibits activities of increasing new blood flow and relaxing the tension of cerebral blood vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the composition of the present invention is characterized in that it provides a superior hypotensive effect but does not decrease the blood pressure to below the normal range, and further that it has no influence upon normal blood pressure and hypotension. In addition, the composition of the present invention does not show any detectable side effect in the course of controlling hypertension but exhibits a progressive and continuous effect of treating hypertension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In other words, the composition of the present invention, a drug for improving a disorder of blood circulation, has a cardiotonic activity, increases blood flow in coronary artery and reduces oxygen consumption, while at the same time, exhibiting a potent sedative activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The composition showing the above-mentioned effects has been developed by the inventors of the present invention through a prolonged experimental study using numerous medicinal herbs related to the controlling of blood pressure, from which it has been confirmed that the novel composition comprising <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic></highlight>extract exhibits a superior hypotensive activity and has substantially no toxicity and side effects. As a result, we have completed the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In view of the fact that the pharmacologically active components contained in those herbal plants has an effect of improving abnormal symptoms occurring in cardiac system and blood circulation, we have applied the composition of the present invention to hypertension and observed that the composition of the present invention has no side effect on cardiac system and cerebrovascular system and exhibits an effect of smoothly controlling and improving blood pressure. Further, the inventive composition serves to keep the blood pressure above the normal value, thus preventing any abnormal symptom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The main components of the composition according to the present invention are saponin and aglycons thereof. However, it has not been identified as yet that the hypotensive effect of the composition of the present invention is induced by these main components. Recently, in China it has been reported that ginseng plants increase the blood flow in coronary artery of animals and exhibit an effect of reducing oxygen consumption by cardiac muscle to reduce the load of heart. In addition, the extract of the present invention is concerned with the endocrine system, and particularly, improves the disorder of blood circulation due to clotting factor. The composition of the present invention makes the function of blood circulatory and cardiovascular systems smooth and can be continuously used with little side effect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In the composition of the present invention, the mixed extract of <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic></highlight>is used after removing resins, proteins and fibroid materials therefrom. In case of the aqueous extract, <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic></highlight>are first macerated or digested in tap water or distilled water and then filtered, and chloroform or hexane is added to the filtrate to remove resins, proteins and fibroid materials. Then, the mixed extract of <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic></highlight>is purified with addition of talc and then pulverized by lyophilization. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> The hypotensive effects were compared with each other by orally administering each of the single extract of <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>prepared in Comparative Example 1, the single extract of <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic></highlight>prepared in Comparative Example 2, and the mixed extract prepared in Example 1 once in an amount of 250 mg/kg. In conducting this experiment, rats suffering from genetically induced hypertension (SHR: spontaneous hypertensive rats) were used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> First, in order to use SHR in non-anesthetic state for the experiment the following operation was conducted according to the method proposed by Chiu et al. (Chuang C. Chiueh and Irwin J. Kopin; J. Physiol. 234 (6), H690-H695, 1978). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> SHR was anesthetized by intraperitoneally injecting sodium pentobarbital (Entobar prepared by Hanrim Pharm.) in an amount of 50 mg per kg of body weight. Then, polyethylene catheter (PE-50; Clay Adams) filled with heparin solution (500 IU/ml in saline, prepared by Choong-Wai Pharm.) was inserted into left carotid by about 2 cm and pulled out toward the back of neck via subcutaneous layer. In this procedure, the catheter and operating appliances were sterilized with 70% alcohol to use in the operation, the operation site was covered with sulfadiazine powder, and heparin solution was injected into the catheter in an amount of 0.5 ml twice a day in order to prevent the blood coagulation in the catheter. Blood pressure and heart rate were observed 24 hours after insertion of the catheter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded on Grass polygraph (Model 7E, Grass Instrument) by connecting the catheter inserted into carotid directly to Statham pressure transducer (P23 ID) and the mean arterial tension was simultaneously recorded through a separate channel. The pressure transducer was positioned so as to be parallel with the position of rat heart. The heart rate was measured by means of cardio-tachograph (7P44C) of arterial pulse wave through a separate channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Rats as transported to measure blood pressure and heart rate were allowed to stand for 2 hours for stabilization and sedation and then, blood pressure and heart rate were measured. Then, each of the single extract of <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>prepared in Comparative Example 1, the single extract of <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic></highlight>prepared in Comparative Example 2, and the mixed extract prepared in Example 1 was orally administered. The blood pressure and heart rate obtained as the result of experiment were presented on the average of 10 values read for 5 minutes at intervals of 30 seconds, and the systolic blood pressure was separately presented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. SHR not receiving the extract was used as the control group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it could be identified that the mixed extract of Example 1 exhibits a significant hypotensive effect in comparison to the control group. Contrary to this, administration of the extract of <highlight><italic>Panax notoginseng </italic></highlight>prepared in Comparative Example 1 shows a tendency to lower the systolic blood pressure but does not provide a significant difference over the control group. The extract of <highlight><italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza </italic></highlight>exhibits no hypotensive effect.
