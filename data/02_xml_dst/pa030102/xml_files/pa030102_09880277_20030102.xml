<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the figures and in particular to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> top view and an end view of a prior art circuit module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are depicted. Circuit module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is depicted as a circuit module as used in various multimedia memory applications and compatible with the MultiMediaCard Association (MMCA) standards for multimedia memory cards (MMC). The present invention is also applicable to cards and modules having other outlines such as Secure Digital cards as promulgated by the Secure Digital Association (SDA) and various compact flash memory cards, etc. The present invention applies to peripheral device cards (I/O cards), as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to which integrated circuit dies <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are attached and circuit contacts <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are included on the bottom side, is covered by a lid <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that is bonded to carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The housing may be completely formed from an encapsulant, or the circuit may be encapsulated and a lid <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> applied over the encapsulant. A cavity <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is included in the lid <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a graphic identifying circuit module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is typically applied in this cavity <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The graphics used are typically the manufacturer&apos;s identification and are neither removable or personalizable by an end-user or a third-party manufacturer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> top and an end view of a circuit module in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is depicted. Circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is adapted for use with a removable housing that includes a personalizable graphic. Rather than using a lid <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having a cavity <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> as the prior art circuit module <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a lid <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A that does not extend completely to the sides of carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Lid <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A covers dies <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and is permanently attached to carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The edge of lid <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A may be adapted to accept a removable housing that will be further illustrated below. The adaptation of circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides for personalization of graphics by attachment and removal of a removable housing for holding a graphical insert on which graphics may be printed, proving a fast and economical method for personalization. Alternatively, removable housing may be colored or textured to provide personalization without attachment of a pictorial or textual graphic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Since MMCs, SD cards and other applications for circuit modules require very thin packages, the removable housing must be made with very thin walls from a material which is generally an injection molded plastic resin. In order to mold a thin wall housing of this sort, it is generally necessary to vent the mold by using PORCERAX or another porous mold material, rather than using standard venting techniques. The porous molding material relieves pressure within the mold, permitting thin plastic structures to be made in a fast molding process, without the use of vents that would disrupt the surface of the removable housing and permitting the molten resin to flow fast enough to fill all of the mold features. The mold may be made with PORCEPAX sides, which will permit air to escape through the mold walls. A housing made by the above-described mold may be identified by rough surfaces in areas that have contacted the PORCERAX portions of the mold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> top and an end view of a circuit module/removable housing assembly is depicted in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. A removable housing is attached to a circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A and retained by flexible tabs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that are formed at the edge of the bottom of removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> provides a graphic mount <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for a graphic <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that may be screen printed, pad printed, direct laser printed or an insert may be printed and molded into removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, graphic mount <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be a pocket for insertion of an insert containing graphic <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In the alternative embodiment having a pocket, the graphic mount <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be a frame with a window for displaying a graphic <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that is insertable between removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A. The window may be covered or may be an aperture that exposes the surface of graphic within a frame formed by removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A is depicted as an encapsulation forming a lid <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B. While a separate lid may be applied, a lid for dies <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be provided by an encapsulant molded in the form depicted as lid <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B. Lid <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B does not extend to the edges of carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, but provides an exposed portion of carrier, which may be a printed circuit board or other substrate suitable for mounting of dies as known to those of ordinary skill in the art of integrated circuit packaging. The edges of carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are used as a retaining edge, retaining circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A within removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in conjunction with flexible tabs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, but lid <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B can be extended to the edges of carrier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for use in conjunction with other retaining designs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, an end view of circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A and removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are depicted in their unattached configuration, with an arrow depicting the attachment direction in which a force may be applied to attach the removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> to circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A. In this depiction, flexible tabs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>o are clearly illustrated with circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A removed. When removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is brought in contact with circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A and a slight force (F) is applied in the indicated direction, flexible tabs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> will deform temporarily, permitting circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A to enter the bottom of removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and be retained by flexible tabs <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in accordance with the configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>B, an end view of an alternative embodiment of a removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A and a circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B in accordance with the present invention is depicted. In this embodiment, a retaining edge is formed on both removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A and circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B by means of a protrusion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>A molded into removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A and a mating recess <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> molded in the enapsulant forming lid <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>C. When removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A is brought in contact with circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B and a slight force (F) is applied in the indicated direction, the edges of removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A will deform temporarily, permitting circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B to enter the bottom of removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A, seating protrusion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>A within mating recess <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, thereby retaining circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>B within removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>C, an end view of another alternative embodiment of a removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B and a circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C in accordance with the present invention is depicted.

When removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B is brought in contact with circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C and a slight force (F) is applied in the indicated direction, the edges of removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B will deform temporarily, permitting circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C to enter the bottom of removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B, seating protrusion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>A within mating recess <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>B, thereby retaining circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>C within removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>D, an end view of yet another alternative embodiment of a removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>C and a circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D in accordance with the present invention is depicted. In this other alternative embodiment, a retaining mechanism is formed on both removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>C and circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D by means of a protrusion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>C molded in removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>C and a mating recess <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>B molded into the enapsulant forming lid <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>E. When removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>C is brought in contact with circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D and a slight force (F) is applied in the indicated direction, protrusion <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>C will seat within mating recess <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>B, thereby retaining circuit module <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>D within removable housing <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>C. Thus, recesses or protrusions may be used on either the inside surfaces of a removable housing with a corresponding mating surface molded in the encapsulant. When the removable housing is then attached by applying force, then the mating surfaces will interlock and retain the removable housing to the encapsulent, detachably coupling the removable housing to the circuit module. </paragraph>
