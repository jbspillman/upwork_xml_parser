<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to a circuit that provides a regulated output voltage and more specifically to a circuit that uses a pulse frequency modulated technique to generate the regulated output voltage. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Many electronic applications of today require the use of circuits capable of providing a stable output voltage over a range of input voltages. Devices such as cellular telephones and personal digital assistants typically receive their power from a supply battery. As the device operates, battery power is consumed and the battery voltage changes. Consequently, if the supply voltage is not regulated, the performance of the device can change over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The prior art teaches many ways to accomplish this conversion. For example, some portable electronic devices use arrays of capacitors (e.g., charge pumps) to convert the source voltage into a voltage with a different polarity and/or magnitude. Other devices use switching power supplies to provide a regulated voltage for proper operation. Switching losses inherent in such supplies can limit the power efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Typically, the regulation circuit is left on when the portable electronic device goes into a sleep mode. If the light load quiescent current of the regulator circuit is not controlled effectively, the life of the supply battery is significantly reduced, even when the device is in sleep mode. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a circuit and method for providing a regulated output voltage. The present invention increases the amount of output current delivered to a load and reduces the amount of quiescent current used by the regulation circuit when an electronic device is in sleep mode. The circuit provides increased output current transfer to the load by applying a voltage source to an inductor until a maximum allowable current through the inductor is realized. The supply voltage is then removed from the inductor and the current is transferred to the load for at least a minimum period. The minimum period is substantially proportional to the output voltage and the supply voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the invention relates to a voltage regulation circuit. The circuit includes a feedback comparator, a latch module, a switch, a current limit module and a pulse module. The feedback comparator includes a first input terminal configured to receive a regulated output voltage, a second input terminal configured to receive a first reference voltage, and an output terminal. The feedback comparator generates a comparison signal at its output terminal in response to the regulated output voltage. The latch module includes a first input terminal in communication with the feedback comparator output terminal, a second input terminal configured to receive an off-time signal having a variable asserted duration, and an output terminal. The latch module generates a charge signal in response to the comparison signal and the off-time signal. The switch includes a control terminal in communication with the latch output terminal, a first terminal configured to receive a current level signal, and a second terminal configured to receive a second reference voltage. The current limit module includes a first input terminal in communication with the latch output terminal, a second input terminal configured to receive the current-level signal, a third input terminal configured to receive the regulated output voltage, and a current limit output terminal. The current limit module generates a peak detect signal in response to the charge signal, the regulated output voltage and the current-level signal. The pulse module includes a first input terminal in communication with the current limit module output terminal, a second input terminal configured to receive a supply voltage, a third input terminal configured to receive the regulated output voltage, and an output terminal in communication with the second latch input terminal. The pulse module generates the off-time signal in response to the peak detect signal, the supply voltage and the output voltage. In one embodiment, the variable asserted duration of the off-time signal is substantially proportional to the inverse of the difference between the regulated output voltage and the input voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the circuit includes a driver module having an input terminal in communication with the latch output terminal and an output terminal in communication with the first input terminal of the current limit module and the switch control terminal. In another embodiment, the current limit module includes a limit switch and a limit comparator. The limit switch includes a control terminal in communication with the third input terminal of the current limit module, a first terminal configured to receive a reference current, and a second input terminal configured to receive a third reference voltage. The limit comparator includes first input terminal in communication with the first terminal of the limit switch, a second input terminal in communication with the second terminal of the current limit module, a reset terminal in communication with the first of the current limit module and an output terminal in communication with the current limit output terminal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the circuit includes a feedback comparator, a pulse generation module, and a logic module. The feedback comparator includes a first input terminal configured to receive a regulated output voltage, a second input terminal configured to receive a first reference voltage, and an output terminal. The feedback comparator generates a comparison signal at its output terminal in response to the regulated output voltage. The pulse generation module includes an output terminal and provides an off-time signal with a first state at its output terminal. The first state has a dynamically determined duration. The logic module includes a first logic terminal in communication with the feedback comparator output terminal, a second logic module terminal in communication with the pulse generation module output terminal, and a charge control terminal. The logic module provides a charge signal at the charge control terminal in response to the comparison signal and the off-time signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention relates a method for generating a regulated output voltage. The method includes the steps of comparing the regulated output voltage and a reference voltage, and comparing an inductor current and a reference current. Additionally, the method includes the steps of charging an inductor if the regulated output voltage is less than the reference voltage and if the inductor current is less the reference current, and discharging the inductor for at least a minimum time if the inductor current increases to substantially equal to the reference current. In one embodiment, the minimum time is responsive to a supply voltage and the regulated output voltage. In a further embodiment, the minimum time is substantially proportional to the reciprocal of the difference between the regulated output voltage and the supply voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the method includes the step of generating an off-time signal having a first state of an asserted duration and a second state. The method also includes the steps of charging an inductor if the regulated output voltage is less than a reference voltage and the off-time signal is not in the first state, and interrupting the charging of the inductor for at least the asserted duration if the off-time signal transitions from the second state to the first state. In one embodiment, the asserted duration is dynamically configured in response to the regulated output voltage and a supply voltage. In a further embodiment, the asserted duration is substantially proportional to the reciprocal of the difference between the output voltage and the supply voltage.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, in brief overview, one embodiment of the voltage regulation circuit constructed in accordance with the present invention includes a feedback comparator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a latch module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a current limit module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a driver module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and a pulse generation module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The feedback comparator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a feedback comparator output terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a first feedback comparator input terminal <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> configured to receive a first reference voltage VREF, and a second feedback comparator input terminal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> configured to receive an output voltage VOUT generated across a load <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and a load capacitance <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The feedback comparator output terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is in communication with a first input terminal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the latch module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the latch module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes an output terminal <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and a second input terminal <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> configured to receive an off-time signal OFF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The driver module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes an input terminal <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in communication with the output terminal <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of latch module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and an output terminal <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> includes a control terminal <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in communication with the output terminal <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the driver module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a first terminal <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> in communication with an inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and a second terminal <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> connected to ground. In one embodiment, switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET). The current limit module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a first input terminal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in communication with the inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a second input terminal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in communication with the output terminal <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the driver module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a third input terminal <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> configured to receive the output voltage VOUT, and an output terminal <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Pulse generation module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> includes a first input terminal <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> in communication with the output terminal <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of current limit module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a second input terminal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> configured to receive the supply voltage VSUPPLY, a third input terminal <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> configured to receive the output voltage VOUT, and an output terminal <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> in communication with the second input terminal <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the latch module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the voltage regulation circuit includes a voltage divider network (not shown) configured to provide a scaled representation of the output voltage VOUT at the second feedback comparator input terminal <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, input terminals <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of feedback comparator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are in communication with VOUT and VREF, respectively. Consequently, latch module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is modified, for example, by adding an inverter, to accommodate the resulting change in the comparison signal COMP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The following is a general overview of the signals referenced in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and four operating states of the present invention as summarized in Table 1. In operation, the feedback comparator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> compares output voltage VOUT to the reference voltage VREF. In response, feedback comparator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generates a comparison signal COMP at output terminal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> indicative of whether the reference voltage VREF exceeds the output voltage VOUT. In response to comparison signal COMP and the off-time signal OFF, latch module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> generates a charge signal CHARGE which is received by driver module <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> at input terminal <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Amplified charge signal ACHARGE provided at output terminal <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is applied to the control terminal <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> controls the application of the supply voltage VSUPPLY across inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by connecting and disconnecting terminal <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to ground. Current limit module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> receives the amplified charge signal ACHARGE, the output voltage VOUT, and a current level signal CURRENT LEVEL indicative of the magnitude of current flowing through inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and in response, generates a peak current level detection signal PEAK at output terminal <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Pulse generation module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> receives peak current level detection signal PEAK, supply voltage VSUPPLY, and output voltage VOUT and, in response, generates off-time signal OFF (i.e., a &ldquo;one-shot&rdquo; signal) at output terminal <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The duration of off-time signal OFF is dependent on supply voltage VSUPPLY and output voltage VOUT. By dynamically controlling the duration of off-time signal OFF in response to variations in supply voltage VSUPPLY and output voltage VOUT, the power transfer from inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to load <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is improved because the current ripple dependency on supply voltage VSUPPLY is eliminated. The application of supply voltage VSUPPLY to inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is described in more detail below.

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In one mode of operation, the current through inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is nonzero at the beginning of a charge cycle. This mode of operation is referred to as continuous conduction mode (CCM) because there is an uninterrupted current flowing through inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A complementary operating mode, referred to as discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), is implemented if the current through inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> decreases to substantially zero for a finite time during operation, such as during sleep mode. Typically, only a small average current is required to maintain output voltage VOUT in regulation during in DCM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates various signals depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> for the CCM and DCM operating modes. Region A depicts a heavy load condition (i.e., a large load current exists), during which the circuit operates in CCM to maintain output voltage VOUT in regulation. Region B of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts the signals of the circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> under DCM operation (e.g., sleep mode). As depicted at the transition from region A to region B, the inductor current continues to increase as the load changes. Due to the reduced load <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in DCM, output voltage VOUT remains greater than the first reference voltage VREF for extended periods. Region C of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> again depicts the signals in CCM mode. As depicted, load <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is less than the load <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of region A, but larger than the load <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of region B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> With reference to the circuit start-up depicted in region A, output voltage VOUT is less than reference voltage VREF. Consequently, comparison signal COMP is logic high. Also during start-up, off-time signal OFF is logic low and peak current detection signal PEAK is logic low. Consequently, latch module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> generates charge signal CHARGE at logic high and driver <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> generates amplified charge signal ACHARGE at logic high. As a result, switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is connected to ground. The current through inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> increases with time until it reaches a maximum allowable value. The peak current detection signal PEAK then transitions from logic low to logic high. Consequently, off-time signal OFF transitions from logic low to logic high, and charge signal CHARGE and amplified charge signal ACHARGE transition from logic high to logic low. In response, switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is disconnected from ground. The voltage at inductor terminal <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is sufficient to forward bias diode <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, so that current flows to load capacitance <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and load <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The current though inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> decreases for the duration that off-time signal OFF is logic high. This duration is determined in response to supply voltage VSUPPLY and output voltage VOUT. At the expiration of this duration, output voltage VOUT is less than reference voltage VREF and the inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is again charged until the maximum allowable current occurs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The load <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is substantially reduced at the start of region B. Due to the reduced load, output voltage VOUT is greater than reference voltage VREF for an extended period of time after the expiration of logic high of off-time signal OFF. A new charge cycle begins when output voltage VOUT decreases to equal the reference voltage VREF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With reference to region C, the load <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is less than the load <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for region A but sufficient to require CCM operation. As comparison signal COMP transitions from logic low to logic high, switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is connected to ground and the current through inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> increases until it equals the maximum allowable current. As a result, off-time signal OFF transitions from logic low to logic high and switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is disconnected from ground. Inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> discharges for longer than the duration of off-time signal OFF.

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> When output voltage VOUT decreases to the first reference voltage VREF, comparison signal COMP transitions to logic high. Thus the input signals at the first NOR gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, comparison signal COMP and charge signal CHARGE, are at logic high and logic low, respectively. In response, latch signal QBAR transitions to logic low. The input signals to the second NOR gate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, latch signal QBAR and off-time signal OFF, are both logic low. In response, charge signal CHARGE transitions to logic high, therefore rending switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> conductive and applying supply voltage VSUPPLY across inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. When charge signal CHARGE transitions to logic high, at least one of the input signals to the first NOR gate <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, charge signal CHARGE or comparison signal COMP, is at logic high. Consequently, latch signal QBAR remains at logic low, latch module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;set&rdquo;, and supply voltage VSUPPLY remains applied across inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> When off-time signal OFF transitions to logic high, the input signals to the second NOR gate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, latch signal QBAR and off-time signal OFF, are at logic low and logic high, respectively. In response, charge signal CHARGE transitions to logic low, thereby rendering switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> nonconductive. Consequently, supply voltage VSUPPLY is no longer applied across inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. If output voltage VOUT is greater than the reference voltage VREF when latch signal QBAR transitions to logic low, comparison signal COMP is at logic low. Because comparison signal COMP and charge signal CHARGE are both at logic low, latch signal QBAR is at logic high. Thus charge signal CHARGE at output terminal <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the second NOR gate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is at logic low, as explained above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, one embodiment of current limit module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes a limit switch <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> and a limit comparator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The limit switch <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> includes a first terminal <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> configured to receive a reference current REFCURRENT from current source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a second terminal <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> coupled to ground, and a control terminal <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> in communication with the third input terminal <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment limit switch <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is a MOSFET. Limit comparator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a first input terminal <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in communication with the second input terminal <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of current limit module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to receive a voltage VINDI, defined across switch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, that is indicative of the current through inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a second input terminal <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> configured to receive a voltage VREFI defined across limit switch <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> indicative of the reference current REFCURRENT, a reset terminal <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in communication with the first input terminal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of current limit module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and an output terminal <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> which is the output terminal <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of current limit module <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In operation, when charge signal CHARGE is logic high, current through inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> increases. Limit comparator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> compares input voltages VINDI and VREFI, during the charging of inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. When voltage VINDI is greater than voltage VREFI, peak current detection signal PEAK transitions to logic high indicating that the maximum current flow through inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has occurred. Consequently, off-time signal OFF transitions to logic high, charge signals CHARGE and ACHARGE transitions to logic low, and limit comparator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is reset (i.e., pulled low by amplified charge signal ACHARGE) to terminate further comparison. As a result, supply voltage VSUPPLY is no longer applied across inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and excess inductor current that can damage the inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, one embodiment of the present invention relates to a method for providing a regulated output voltage. In step <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> output voltage VOUT is compared with reference voltage VREF. If output voltage VOUT is greater than reference voltage VREF, the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> and inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is discharged if current is present in inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. If there is no current in inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the method continues to loop between steps <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> until output voltage VOUT is less than reference voltage VREF. If output voltage VOUT is less than reference voltage VREF, the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> to determine if the current flowing through inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is less than reference current REFCURRENT. If the current through inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is greater than or equal to reference current REFCURRENT, the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> and inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is discharged for a minimum time substantially proportional to the reciprocal of the difference between output voltage VOUT and supply voltage VSUPPLY. If the current through inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is less than reference current REFCURRENT, the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, and supply voltage VSUPPLY is applied across inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the current flowing through inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> increases. The method returns to step <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> and the current through inductor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is again compared with the reference current REFCURRENT. </paragraph>
