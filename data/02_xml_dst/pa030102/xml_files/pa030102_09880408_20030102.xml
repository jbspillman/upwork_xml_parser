<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Computers have become ubiquitous in our society. Their presence has both raised productivity and increased the quality of life. One feature that has allowed the computer to become so valuable is portability. Many of these devices are designed to be portable and thus a single device can be carried by a user and used in different locations. This creates many design challenges to ensure the reliability of the devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One common characteristic shared by all computers is that they create heat energy. The heat generated can be detrimental to the device if it is not dissipated or removed in some manner. Computers often rely on air exchange with the ambient environment to cool the device. This works well unless the air exchange is somehow blocked. This condition is especially prevalent in portable computers that are used in a multitude of different environments </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For example, the user of a portable computer may choose to use the device on a couch, in a bed, or lying on a carpet. In these environments, it may be more likely for air exchange to be blocked by, for example a blanket or pillow. If such a condition goes unnoticed it may be detrimental to the computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is desirable to provide improved systems and methods that reduce the likelihood of a computer overheating. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Methods and systems for protecting a computing device are described. In one embodiment, a computer is provided and includes a housing that defines an internal cavity. A CPU is mounted within the internal cavity and a sensing circuit is mounted on the housing. The sensing circuit is configured to sense a temperature of the internal cavity. The sensing circuit generates a signal that can be used to ensure that the computer does not overheat when the temperature of the internal cavity reaches a definable threshold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the computer has at least one ventilation structure in the housing which allows air to enter the internal cavity. The computer also has a sensing circuit comprising a photo-sensor mounted on the housing and positioned to sense light entering the internal cavity through a ventilation structure. The circuit generates a signal responsive to a condition that indicates that light is not entering the internal cavity in an amount that suggests that the ventilation structure is unblocked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a method for protecting a computer comprises sensing an area proximate a ventilation structure in a computer housing and generating a signal if an object at least partially blocks the ventilation structure.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Exemplary Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> show an exemplary computer in accordance with one embodiment. The computer can comprise any suitable computer as described above. In this particular example, the computer comprises a notebook computer. Computer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that defines an internal cavity <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) inside of which internal components of the computer are housed. The computer also includes a keyboard <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and a display <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The computer&apos;s housing also includes a ventilation structure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The ventilation structure is provided so that air can flow into and out of the internal cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Airflow is desirable for maintaining a temperature within the cavity that promotes normal computer operation. Specifically, without ventilation structure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, it is quite likely that the internal components of the computer might overheat due to heat generation issues that are typically associated with computer operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a cross-section of the computer showing a portion of the internal cavity in a little more detail. Specifically shown is a CPU <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a cooling fan <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and a module <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> designated &ldquo;components.&rdquo; These &ldquo;components&rdquo; can comprise printed circuit boards, memory modules, and various other components that are typically provided within a computer&apos;s housing. A sensor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is also provided within the internal cavity. One purpose of the sensor is to sense conditions which could lead to a computer overheating. Accordingly, the sensor decreases the likelihood that the computer will overheat. Mounted on the housing is notification device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> which is described further in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The sensor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and notification device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> can be components of a sensing/notification circuit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which is described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> further illustrates one non-limiting embodiment of the sensing circuit. For the sake of illustration, the sensing/notification circuit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is broken into two distinct structures, a sensing circuit and a notification circuit, which are functionally coupled. It is not essential to the embodiments described herein that all of these elements exist, or that these two circuits exist independently. Rather, one skilled in the art will readily see many other configurations which provide functional embodiments. In some embodiments the sensing/notification circuit can comprise the sensing circuit without a notification circuit element. Likewise, some embodiments can have a sensor coupled to a notification circuit without a sensing circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Other embodiments use a combination of applicable sensors and circuitry. Several types of sensors can be utilized in various embodiments. Exemplary non-limiting examples are photo-sensors <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and thermo-sensors <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment a photo-sensor <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> can be a component of the sensing/notification circuit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The photo-sensor is mounted on the housing <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and is positioned to sense light entering the internal cavity through the ventilation structure <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The sensing/notification circuit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is configured to generate a signal responsive to a condition that indicates that light is not entering the internal cavity in an amount that suggests that the ventilation structure is unblocked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> For example, a person using a notebook computer in the evening might lie down on a bed to complete some of the day&apos;s work. The sensing circuit would sense ambient light entering through the ventilation structure. If a pillow fell against the ventilation structure it would cut off the light and the airflow into the internal cavity. The sensing circuit would then generate a signal which results in a user notification. The user, perceiving the notification, would remove the pillow, thus preventing overheating of the computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, in some embodiments, if the ventilation structure is blocked, the sensing/notification circuit can generate a signal which results in a notification being generated for the user. The purpose of the notification is to alert a user that blockage may be occurring. Exemplary non-limiting examples of user notification include a visual notification or an audio notification. In one embodiment, a visual notification is displayed by the notification device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The notification device can comprise an LED <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> which is mounted on the computer housing so that it is visible to a computer user. The LED can light-up or blink in any way that is likely to be noticed by the user. Alternatively, the signal/notification circuit can generate a display notification <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> that can appear on display <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. For example, on a Windows&reg; based computer the display notification can be similar to the rectangular information window which displays various important messages for the user. The notification can be superimposed over the current display window so that it is easily noticed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, an audio notification can be produced on notification device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, notification device <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> comprises a speaker <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, and an audio notification can be generated on the speaker. It is recognized that most computers have existing speakers and while a dedicated speaker is shown in the drawings for the purpose of illustration, it is not essential to the present embodiment. The system described will work equally well with any other speaker associated with the computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> For the purpose of clarity, several distinct ways of notifying the user have been described. One skilled in the art will recognize other ways of increasing the likelihood that a computer user perceives the notification. For example, it may be beneficial to combine two or more types of notification, i.e. a visual notification can be displayed on the computer display, and an audio notification created. In this way, if the user is in front of the screen the visual method should be adequate, but if the user is doing something else, the audio notification may get their attention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> To further protect the computer in case the user does not perceive or respond to the notification, the computer can be shut down responsive to the signal being generated by the sensor. The shutdown can occur immediately, or alternatively, after the signal is generated for a definable period of time. The delay allows time for the user to correct the condition without having the computer shut down. Yet, if the user fails to correct the condition, the computer is protected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> One skilled in the art will recognize many combinations of components which can achieve a computer shutdown. The means for shutting down the computer can be constructed using the components described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In one embodiment, the computer shutdown can be achieved with controller <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> For example, the controller can be connected to the sensor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the computer&apos;s power supply (not shown) so that if a signal is received from the sensor, the computer is shut down. If a delay in shutting down the computer is desired, timer circuit <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> can be connected to controller <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> so that the shutdown occurs only after a definable period of time. In another example, the same functional means can be achieved using logic circuit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Various components are described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> that can be used to shut down the computer if an overheating condition is detected by the sensor. However, one skilled in the art will readily see other ways to carry out the present embodiment. For example, most computers already have a built-in time-keeping capability somewhere in the hardware or software. One skilled in the art could easily construct a delay means for shutting down the computer using the computer&apos;s existing time keeping capability. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Exemplary Second Embodiment </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In another exemplary embodiment, the sensing/notification circuit <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> comprises a thermo-sensor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> which senses a temperature of the internal cavity. The sensing circuit generates a signal that can be used to keep the computer from overheating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> For example, the thermo-sensor can be mounted inside the cavity and connected to an LED. If the thermo-sensor measures a temperature above the average recommended operating temperature for the computer, or any other threshold that might be set, the thermo-sensor can generate a signal which results in the LED being illuminated. Of course, all of the other notification mechanisms discussed above can be employed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Exemplary Method </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the discussions above and below, certain aspects of the described embodiments can be implemented in terms of software instructions that reside on a computer readable medium. These instructions, when executed by a computer or processor, are configured to implement a design functionality. This functionality will be described in this document in flow chart form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a flow diagram that describes steps in a method in accordance with one described embodiment. The steps can be implemented by way of the exemplary computer of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> operating in conjunction with the sensing/notification circuit of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The method can also be practiced through the use of any other suitable hardware, software, firmware, or combination thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> sets a threshold temperature associated with a temperature within a computer housing. This temperature can be any temperature above which it is desirable to know the temperature has been exceeded. For example, the temperature selected can be one above which the computer suffers from the possibility of shortened functional lifespan. In another case, the temperature can simply be the average operating temperature of the computer model selected. The temperature can be set by the computer manufacturer, a dealer setting up the computer and software, or a user. In some embodiments the adjustments can be made through the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; and &ldquo;Control Panel&rdquo; screen displays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Once the threshold temperature has been set, step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> senses a temperature within the computer housing with a sensor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> that is positioned on the housing. Any appropriate type of sensor can be used with exemplary sensors described above. The sensor can be placed anywhere in the housing where it provides useful information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> generates a signal if the sensed temperature exceeds the threshold temperature. Examples of signals and how they can be used are given above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, if a signal is generated at step <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> takes an action based on the generated signal. This action can include shutting down the computer responsive to the signal, or shutting down the computer if the sensed temperature exceeds the threshold temperature for a definable period of time. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Exemplary Second Method </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flow diagram that describes steps in the method in accordance with one embodiment. The method can be implemented with any appropriate combination of software and/or hardware. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> senses an area proximate a ventilation structure in a computer housing. Sensing can be implemented through multiple different embodiments, as described above. For example, a photo-sensor <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> can be utilized by positioning it so that light entering the internal cavity through the ventilation structure can be sensed. Another example uses a thermo-sensor <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> positioned inside the internal cavity which senses the temperature of the internal cavity. In this example if an obstruction occurs the internal temperature sensed by the thermo-sensor will likely rise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> generates a signal if an object at least partially blocks the ventilation structure. Several non-limiting examples of this step have been described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> takes an action based on the generated signal. Exemplary actions can include shutting the computer down responsive to the signal and shutting the computer down if the signal persists for a definable period of time. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">CONCLUSION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> By monitoring the internal conditions of a computer, such as whether there is adequate airflow, and the internal housing temperature, the likelihood of inadvertent damage from overheating is decreased.
