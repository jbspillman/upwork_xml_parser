<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a process to modify the taste profile of a consumable by adding esters of quinic and cinnamic acid derivatives. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Various consumables, such as food products, beverages, pharmaceuticals, etc. contain substances which provide bitter notes and adversely contribute to the overall flavor of the product. In many instances, the flavor quality of such consumables would be improved by diminishing or removing the bitter notes, while at the same time preserving or enhancing the contribution made to the overall flavor by the non-bitter flavor components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Non-nutritive sweeteners, also called artificial sweeteners, for example, saccharine and aspartame, are only one example of substances that provide bitter notes. Therefore consumables such as beer, coffee, soft drinks, desserts and pharmaceutical products that are sweetened with non-nutritive sweeteners may possess bitter flavors or after-flavors that are generally regarded as undesirable by many consumers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Because of the prevalence and popularity of non-nutritive sweeteners in consumables, several processes have been described for modifying the taste profile of consumables that contain these non-nutritive sweeteners. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,296,079 discloses the addition of 0.003% to 160% maltol to edible foodstuffs sweetened with non-nutritive sweetening agents to mask unpleasant aftertastes. U.S. Pat. No. 4,304,794 discloses the addition of aliphatic polyols to minimize the bitter aftertaste of 2,4,6,3&prime;-tetrahydroxy4&prime;-methoxydihydrochalcone. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,758,438; 3,647,482; and 3,667,969 disclose that the bitter aftertaste of saccharine is diminished by addition of the proteins thaumatin and monellin, by addition of ribonucleosides, ribonucleotides and their deoxy analogs, and by addition of D-galactose, respectively. U.S. Pat. No. 5,336,513 discloses that certain derivatives of cinnamic acid and their salts inhibited the bitterness of consumable materials, such as pharmaceutical preparations, foodstuffs and beverages that were sweetened with the artificial sweeteners saccharine and acesulfame K. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Processes have also been described for modifying a foodstuff or beverage by enhancing its sweetness characteristics. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,867,557 and 3,908,026 disclose that mixing or co-dissolving paramethoxycinnarnaldehyde (PMCA) with other known natural or synthetic sweetening agents results in a composition having enhanced sweetness characteristics. These patents also disclose that PMCA enhances the flavor characteristics of vanillin and instant coffee, while suppressing their associated bitterness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Processes disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,924,017 and 3,916,028 show that salts of chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, cynarine, and their isomers induce sweetness, and impart a very pleasant, sweet character to non-sweet foodstuffs or to foods with very low sweetness, such as water and milk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The above-described references either disclose methods for enhancing or inducing sweetness in consumables, or methods using specific agents to mask unpleasant aftertastes in consumables containing artificial sweeteners. Additional compounds and methods to modify the many types of off-tastes and off-notes in the many varieties of consumables are desired. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The invention discloses the use of chlorogenic acid, defined herein as esters of quinic acid and cinnamic acid derivatives, to modify or mask an off-taste in a consumable. In the method, the esters of quinic acid and cinnamic acid derivatives are added to consumables to modify or mask bitter off-tastes or other displeasing tastes imparted by one or more natural, synthetic or semi-synthetic components in the consumable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> An off-taste may be imparted by a non-nutritive (artificial) sweetener. Off-tastes produced by non-nutritive sweeteners have been described as being metallic and/or bitter. Non-nutritive sweeteners are present in vast categories of consumables including, but not limited to, soft drinks, dairy products, dessert products, savory products, salad dressings, sauces, condiments, alcoholic beverages, confections, gums, and medicaments. Examples of non-nutritive sweeteners include L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester (aspartame), saccharine and salts thereof, acesulfame salts (e.g., acesulfame K), cyclohexylsulfamic acid, dihydrochalcones, xylitol, neotame, sucralose, alitame cyclamates, steviol derivatives, and the like. In the inventive composition, the consumable contains an amount of chlorogenic acids sufficient to modify or mask the off-taste imparted by the artificial sweetener. A sweetening composition of the non-nutritive sweetener and from about 0.0001%<highlight><superscript>w/v </superscript></highlight>about 0.1%<highlight><superscript>w/v </superscript></highlight>chlorogenic acids may also be prepared and added to the consumable. In other embodiments, the concentration of chlorogenic acids in a consumable containing one or more non-nutritive sweeteners is in the range from about 0.001%<highlight><superscript>w/v </superscript></highlight>about 0.01%<highlight><superscript>w/v</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> An off-taste may be imparted by alcohol in the consumable product. Alcohols include both grain alcohols and fermentation products (beer and wine), either alone or in combination with other components. Off-tastes produced by alcohols have been described as imparting a burning taste. In one embodiment, the concentration of chlorogenic acids in a consumable containing alcohol is in the range from about 0.0001%<highlight><superscript>w/v </superscript></highlight>to about 0.1%<highlight><superscript>w/v</superscript></highlight>. In another embodiment, the concentration of chlorogenic acids in a consumable containing alcohol is in the range from about 0.001%<highlight><superscript>w/v </superscript></highlight>to about 0.01%<highlight><superscript>w/v</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> An off-taste may be imparted by a soy product. As used herein, soy includes all consumables containing soy in any form, including soybean oil used either alone, in combination, as a nutraceutical, or as a medicament; soy bean curd; soy milk, soy butter; soy paste; etc. Off-tastes produced by soy products have been described as imparting a beany, aldehyde-like taste. In one embodiment, the concentration of chlorogenic acids in a consumable containing a soy product is in the range from about 0.0001%<highlight><superscript>w/v </superscript></highlight>to about 0.1%<highlight><superscript>w/v</superscript></highlight>. In another embodiment, the concentration of chlorogenic acids in a consumable containing a soy product is in the range from about 0.01%<highlight><superscript>w/v </superscript></highlight>to about 0.1%<highlight><superscript>w/v</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An off-taste may be due to carbonation in the product. Examples of carbonated products include colas, citrus-flavored beverages, ales, beers and other consumables containing these products such as ices and frozen confections. Off-tastes produced by carbonated products have been described as imparting a burning sensation. In one embodiment, the concentration of chlorogenic acids in a carbonated product is in the range from about 0.0001%<highlight><superscript>w/v </superscript></highlight>to about 0.1%<highlight><superscript>w/v</superscript></highlight>. In another embodiment, the concentration of chlorogenic acids in a carbonated product is in the range from about 0.0005%<highlight><superscript>w/v </superscript></highlight>to about 0.005%<highlight><superscript>w/v</superscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Besides modifying an off-taste, the esters of quinic acid and cinnamic acid may also mask an off-taste by reducing its perception and/or enhancing an overall sweetness perception. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term consumable broadly includes all products that are ingested. These encompass foods and beverages whether or not they provide nutritive value and in all forms, including forms requiring reconstitution; condiments; sweeteners; nutraceuticals; gelatins; pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical gums, tablets, lozenges, drops, emulsions, elixirs, syrups, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Specifically, a mixture of esters of quinic acid and various cinnamic acid derivatives encompassing members of the family of chlorogenic acids are added to various consumables to improve the taste or taste perception of the consumable and/or to decrease off-tastes. The quinic and cinnamic acid esters may be naturally occurring, synthetic, or a combination of natural and synthetic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The structure of quinic acid (IR-(1&agr;, 3&agr;, 4&agr;, 5&bgr;)-1, 3, 4, 5 tetrahydroxy-cyclohexane carboxylic acid) is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Quinic acid has axial hydroxyl groups (on carbons 1 and 3) and equatorial hydroxyl groups (on carbons 4 and 5). Substitutions on the R groups produce various chlorogenic acids, as derived from Clifford, ASIC, 17 colloque, Nairobi, 1997, pp 79-91 which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and listed in Table 1, where CQA is caffeoylquinic acid, FQA is feruloylquinic acid, CoQA is coumaroylquinic acid, and CFQA is caffeoylferuloylquinic acid.

<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The structures of various acids or derivatives belonging to the cinnamic acid family are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Cinnamic acids and their derivatives, used as sweetness enhancers/inducers in various products, encompass a series of trans-3-phenyl-propenoic acids that differ in the chemical groups substituted on the aromatic ring. They are widely distributed as organic conjugates in a variety of plant material, and are rarely found as free acids in unprocessed plant material. Besides cinnamic acid itself, the most common of the cinnamic acids in this family are caffeic acid (3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid), ferulic acid (3-methoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid), sinapic acid (3,5-dimethoxy4-hydroxycinnamic acid), and p-coumaric acid (p-hydroxycinnamic acid). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Chlorogenic acid&rdquo; is a trivial name used somewhat loosely in the literature to describe a range of phenolic acids found in plant materials. For example, in some literature references, 5-caffeoylquinic acid alone is referred to as &ldquo;chlorogenic acid&rdquo;. As used herein, however, the term chlorogenic acid is used as prescribed in Clifford, <highlight><italic>J. Sci. Food Agric., </italic></highlight>2000, 80, pp. 1033-1043, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, to refer to the family of related quinic acid conjugates. This reference teaches that the term chlorogenic acid comprises a family of esters that form between certain trans-cinnamic acid derivatives and quinic acid. Clifford subdivides chlorogenic acids by the identity, number, and position of the acyl residues on the quinic acid. This reference teaches that the most common individual chlorogenic acid is 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA), whose structure is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, and that while 5-CQA is commonly referred to as chlorogenic acid (CGA), that this is a term which should be used only to refer to the family of related quinic acid conjugates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Chlorogenic acids are widely distributed in the plant kingdom and occur in fruits, leaves and other tissues of dicotyledonous plants. They may be extracted from a variety of natural sources such as green coffee beans (e.g., Arabica, Robusta and Liberica); leaves of <highlight><italic>Illex paraguariensis</italic></highlight>, pome fruits (e.g., apples and pears); stone fruits (e.g., cherries and plums); berry fruits; citrus fruits; brassica vegetables (e.g., kale, cabbage and brussel sprouts); solanaceae (e.g., potato tubers, tomatoes, and aubergines); asteraceae (e.g., chicoryroot and artichokes); and a variety of other miscellaneous vegetables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> They may also be found in cereal grains (e.g., oats, barley, rye, rice, corn and wheat). The amount and types of chlorogenic acids that are present vary depending upon the source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A variety of chlorogenic acids are found in green coffee beans (Clifford, <highlight><italic>ASIC, </italic></highlight>17 colloque, Nairobi, 1997 pp. 79-91). Specifically, green coffee bean extracts contain the following chlorogenic acids: three mono-esters of caffeic and quinic acids, namely, 3-caffeoylquinic acid (3-CQA), 4-caffeoylquinic acid (4-CQA), and 5-caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA); three mono-esters of p-coumaric and quinic acids: namely, p-coumaroylquinic acids (p CoQA); three mono-esters of ferulic and quinic acids: feruloylquinic acids (FQA); and three di-esters of caffeic and quinic acids: namely, 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3,4-di CQA), 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3,5-di CQA), and 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (4,5-di CQA). In addition, there are also six mixed di-esters of caffeic, ferulic, and quinic acids known as the caffeoylferuloylquinic acids (CFQA). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The amounts of several of these chlorogenic acids found in extracts of green Robusta coffee beans have been reported. These values, as follows, are expressed as g/kg of dry green coffee bean: 7.32 g 3-CQA, 11.25 g 4-CQA, 49.66 g 5-CQA, 6.04 g 5-FQA, 5.05 g 3,4-di CQA, 4.61 g 3,5-di CQA, and 4.11 g 4,5-di CQA (Trugo and Macrae, <highlight><italic>Food Chemistry, </italic></highlight>1984,15, pp. 219-227, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). While the presence of chlorogenic acids in green coffee bean extracts is known, the use of these chlorogenic acids to decrease off-taste in various types of consumables has not previously been reported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the inventive method, chlorogenic acids are provided to the consumable. Either chlorogenic acids extracted from one or more botanical sources, and/or synthetic chlorogenic acids may be used. A solution of the chlorogenic acids may be added to the consumable to modify or mask an off-taste imparted by one or more substances, such as an artificial sweetener. Alternatively, chlorogenic acids may be added to the substance(s) imparting an off-taste to form a composition which is added to the consumable. The total concentration of chlorogenic acids in the consumable ranges from about 0.0001%<highlight><superscript>w/v </superscript></highlight>to about 0.1%<highlight><superscript>wv</superscript></highlight>, depending upon the type of consumable, the source of chlorogenic acids, the qualitative and/or quantitative modification desired, the substance(s) imparting an off-taste, and the presence of other desirable or undesirable taste components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As an example of an extraction procedure, the procedure used for extraction of chlorogenic acids from green coffee beans is described. The procedure may be modified to extract chlorogenic acids from other plant sources, as is known to one skilled in the art. Therefore, while the extraction of chlorogenic acids from green coffee beans is described for illustration, it will be appreciated that the invention is not limited to the use of chlorogenic acids extracted from this source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> About 4.0 kg of green Robusta coffee beans were mixed with constant agitation in 16.0 kg of water at 80&deg; C. for at least four hours. The extract was collected by either decanting, centrifuging, or filtering. The beans were then extracted with an additional 6 kg of water at 80&deg; C. for at least another four hours. The extracts were combined and the water was evaporated by vacuum to concentrate the extract to about 5 or 6 kg. An amount of ethanol (95%) equal to one and one-half times the weight of the concentrated extract was added; the amount of ethanol may be increased to about four times the weight of the concentrated extract if a higher content of chlorogenic acids in the final extract is desired. The mixture was stirred for 15 minutes, and the slurry was allowed to stand at ambient temperature for at least one hour. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The resulting precipitate was removed by either centrifugation or filtration and was subsequently discarded. The ethanol was evaporated from the supernatant or filtrate under vacuum, and the aqueous solution was dried under vacuum to yield about 460-500 g of a tan-colored powder. Alternatively, the aqueous solution may be concentrated to an appropriate solid content of about 30% to 45% of the total weight, followed by spray-drying the concentrated aqueous solution to a tan colored powder. The powdered extract was soluble in water up to about 5%<highlight><superscript>w/v </superscript></highlight>pH 5.0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The extract was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Prodigy ODS-3 column (150&times;4.6 mm, particle size 5 &mgr;m) (Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif.) at ambient temperature, interfaced with a mass spectroscopic detector (MSD) to measure the chlorogenic acids. The gradient used for elution of the compounds is given in Table 2.

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Other chlorogenic acids were also likely present but were not detected using the conditions for analysis. It will be appreciated that the HPLC and MSD conditions may be modified to resolve different chlorogenic acids, and that the yield and content of chlorogenic acids may vary with different batches and different types of green coffee beans or different sources. Chlorogenic acids may be further purified, for example, using absorption column chromatography, to remove impurities; with undesired properties (e.g., color, low water solubility) from the extract. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Extracts of chlorogenic acids from several batches of green coffee beans were prepared as 2.8%<highlight><superscript>w/v </superscript></highlight>solutions, pH ranging from about pH 4.5 to about pH 6.0, and were added to various consumables based on the weight of powder.
