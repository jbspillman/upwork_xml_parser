<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns a novel method for occluding the vasculature of a patient and, more particularly, a method of treatment in which embolic coils are placed within the patient&apos;s vasculature. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A known technique for treating a brain aneurysm of a patient includes the placement of embolic coils within the aneurysm. To this end, a catheter is introduced into the vessel leading to the aneurysm, and embolic coils are delivered to pack and fill the aneurysm. Ordinarily, a deployment system is used to deliver the coils, via the catheter, to the aneurysm, such as the deployment system disclosed in Hieshima U.S. Pat. No. 6,1 13,622, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The embolic coils act to reduce the blood flow inside of the aneurysm. Typically the embolic coils provide a mechanical blockage to the blood flow in the aneurysm. In this manner, the stagnation of blood that is obtained prevents the blood flow from rupturing the aneurysm. However, such stagnation forms a thrombus inside the aneurysm, that eventually can get resorbed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> We have discovered a method by which the desirable mechanical blockage of blood flow can be obtained with the addition of platelet adhesion to the embolic coils. This allows tissue to be able to grow, and the thrombus that forms, instead of being resorbed, has the ability to be organized into fibrous scar tissue. Such fibrous scar tissue achieves long term healing of the aneurysm in contrast to the use of embolic coils that can move around with the result that the formed thrombus may be resorbed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The method that we have discovered is useful for occluding the vasculature of a patient. In addition to embolizing an aneurysm, the method of the present invention may also be used for embolizing a vessel for vessel sacrifice; for reducing or blocking blood flow to an arterial-venous malformation or to a fistula; and for blocking blood flow to tumors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a novel method for occluding the vasculature of a patient using implanted embolic coils in which there is improved platelet adhesion to the coils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention to provide a novel method for treating an aneurysm of a patient using implanted embolic coils in which there is improved platelet adhesion to the coils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel method for treating an aneurysm of a patient using embolic coils and enabling tissue formation to prevent the coils from moving around within the aneurysm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide a novel embolic coil that is simple in construction and easy to manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A still further object of the present invention is to provide a novel embolic coil which provides improved platelet adhesion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent as the description proceeds. </paragraph>

The method comprises the steps of providing a plurality of embolic coils having a textured surface. The plurality of embolic coils having a textured surface are introduced into the patient&apos;s vasculature.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> there is shown an embolic coil constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention. Embolic coil <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed by winding a platinum-tungsten alloy wire into a helical configuration. In the illustrative embodiment, the diameter of the wire is generally in the range of about 0.0015 to 0.008 inches. The outside diameter of the coil 10 is preferably in the range of about 0.006 to 0.055 inches. The embolic coil 10 shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may be straight or may take the form of various configurations, including the form of a helix, a random shape configuration, or a coil within a coil configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The details of construction of an example embolic coil, although no limitation is intended, is disclosed in Diaz et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,063,100, issued May 16, 2000, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> With the helical wound coil as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the coil is provided with a seal plug <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at its distal end and another seal plug <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at its proximal end. Seal plugs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> serve to prevent the flow of fluid through the lumen of the coil <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Although no limitation is intended, as a specific example coil <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed of a platinum-tungsten alloy comprising 92% platinum and 8% tungsten. In accordance with the present invention, the outer surface of the coil is textured by abrasion or sandblasting. To this end, fifty-micron diameter alumina particles are used to texture the surface of the wire that is used to form the coils, prior to the formation of the helical coils. It has been found that the textured surface provides improved platelet adhesion thus promoting clotting and subsequent endothelialization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Although no limitation is intended, as a specific example the texturization provides a uniform roughness comprising pockets having diameters of between about 0.125 microns and about 50 microns and depths of between about 0.25 microns and about 20 microns. The roughness is uniform throughout the coil except if the coil is used with a detachment system such as disclosed in Hieshima U.S. Pat. No. 6,113,622 or Diaz et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,063,100, a proximal portion of the coil is not textured in order for it to have a proper seal with a gripper so that it can released easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagrammatic view of a patient&apos;s vessel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> leading to an aneurysm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into which a number of embolic coils <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have been introduced. The coils are introduced in a manner known in the art, by introducing a catheter into the vessel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, then introducing a deployment device via the catheter to deliver the embolic coils, one by one, to the aneurysm <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> SEM micrographs of the non-textured vs. textured coils are provided in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> portion of a non-textured coil is shown in a micrograph having an enlargement of 233&times;. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a similar coil with a 233&times; enlargement, but with texture that has been provided by sandblasting as disclosed above. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a greatly enlarged micrograph, having an enlargement of 3880&times;, of the coil sample of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a greatly enlarged micrograph having an enlargement of 3880&times;, of the coil sample of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Testing was conducted using radiolabeled platelets to evaluate an ex vivo aneurysm model. In the model, aneurysms treated with textured coils were compared to aneurysms treated with non-textured coils. The textured coils showed an increased in the platelet deposition of about fifty percent over the non-texture coils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It can be seen that by using embolic coils that have been textured, there is superior platelet adhesion which promotes clotting and subsequent endothelialization. A texturing technique has been disclosed that is simple and does not require expensive or elaborate equipment to modify the coils. In the illustrative embodiment the texturing technique does not require coating or ion implantation, thereby avoiding the importation of any new materials to the coil that would require new biocompatability testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Although an illustrative embodiment of the invention has been shown and described, it is to be understood that various modifications and substitutions may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the novel spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
