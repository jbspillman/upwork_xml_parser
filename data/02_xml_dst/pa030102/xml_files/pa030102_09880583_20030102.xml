<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates in general to the field of an electrical isolation layers, and more particularly, to an electrical isolation layer arranged between a first conductive material and a second conductive material. The isolation layer is capable of inhibiting, if not preventing, either conductive material from electrically passing or bleeding into the other conductive material and thereby causing a high resistance connection among the conductive materials. The present invention has particular application when arranged between a conductive roebel filler and conductive strands sheathed by a porous insulator carrying a high voltage within a stator of a dynamoelectric machine used in a power generation plant. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Many power generation plants produce electricity by converting energy (e.g. fossil fuel, nuclear fission, hydraulic head and geothermal heat) into mechanical energy (e.g. rotation of a turbine shaft), and then converting the mechanical energy into electrical energy (e.g. by the principles of electromagnetic induction). Some of these power generation plants, such as a fossil-fuel power generation plant, comprise a turbine, a generator and an exciter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the above-described power generation scheme involves conductive copper strands located within axially extending slots of the generator&apos;s laminated stator core. As a rotor rotates within the annular stator, magnetic flux induces an electric current through the conductive strands. To compensate for the decrease in magnetic flux density along the transverse (Z-Z) depth of the conductive strands, the conductive strands are transposed along their axial (Y-Y) length such that each strand experiences a similar amount of flux and thus carries a similar amount of current. The most common type of transposition is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 1,144,252 to Roebel and known in the art as roebelling, although other transposition types are known such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,128,779 to Salon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Each conductive strand is typically sheathed with an inexpensive insulation, such as dacron glass (which has a relatively open weave with small porous micro-openings), to insulate the individual strands from each other. The insulated strands are then roebelled. A filler is pressed into the roebel offsets (i.e. open space between the roebelled insulated strands). The filler is advantageously conductive, such as a resin rich felt or mica, to inhibit it from undergoing partial electrical discharge activity and to meet the power factor tip-up requirements in order to maintain a high resistance between strands. Since the conductive filler can electrically pass or bleed through the openings in the dacron glass strand insulation to the conductive strands (and/or vice-versa), low resistance electrical connections among the strands and/or filler can exist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> These low resistance connections are undesirable for a variety of reasons, such as compromising group-to-group coil electrical testing and meeting the power factor tip-up requirements in order to maintain a high resistance between strands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There is thus a need to reduce, if not eliminate, low resistance connections among the strands and/or filler. There is also a need to electrically isolate a first conductive material from a second conductive material. There is also a need for a strand assembly that improves upon the prior art. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention reduces, if not eliminates, low resistance connections among the conductive strands and/or conductive filler, as well as electrically isolates a first conductive material from a second conductive material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention thus involves an electrical isolation layer system comprising, a first conductive material comprising a plurality of copper strands; a second conductive material comprising a roebel filler; and a nomex spun laced felt having a dielectric strength of at least 300 volts per millimeter interposed at least partially between the copper strands and the roebel filler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention thus involves a strand assembly for use within a stator of a dynamoelectric machine of a power generation plant, comprising a plurality of roebelled conductive strands that extend along a generator length; an insulator sheathing each of the strands; a conductive filler at least partially surrounding the insulated strands; and an electrical isolation layer disposed at least partially between the insulated strands and the conductive filler material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A method of forming a strand assembly that extends along an axial length, comprising sheathing a plurality of conductive strands with an insulating material; roebelling the insulated strands; arranging an electrical isolation layer at least partially over the insulated strands; and arranging a conductive filler at least partially over the insulated strands whereby the isolation layer electrically isolates the strands from the filler. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The invention described herein employs several basic concepts. For example, one concept relates to an electrical isolation layer disposed between a first conductive material (e.g. copper strands) and a second conductive material (e.g. roebel filler) which reduces, if not eliminates, low resistance connections among the conductive materials. Another concept relates to an improved strand assembly comprising a plurality of conductive strands sheathed by a relatively porous open weave insulator and a conductive roebel filler that demonstrates minimal low resistance connections among the strands and/or filler through the arrangement of an electrical isolation between the strands and filler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention is disclosed in context of an exemplary generator stator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The principles of the present invention, however, are not limited to generator stators, and can be used in connection with other areas within a generator that have similar requirements to isolate conductive elements or to reduce, if not eliminate, low resistance connections between conductive elements, such as a generator rotor strand assembly and the like. It will be understood by one skilled in the art, in light of the present disclosure, that the present invention disclosed herein can also be successfully utilized in connection with areas outside the generator field and outside the power generation field that have similar requirements to isolate conductive elements or to reduce, if not eliminate, high resistance connections between conductive elements. One skilled in the art may also find additional applications for the apparatus, components, configurations and methods disclosed herein. Thus, the illustration and description of the present invention in context of an exemplary generator stator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is merely one possible application of the present invention. However, the present invention has been found particularly suitable in connection with generator stators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> To assist in the description of the invention described herein, the following terms are used. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> &ldquo;longitudinal axis&rdquo; (X-X) extends along the length of the stator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A &ldquo;lateral axis&rdquo; (Y-Y) extends along the width of the stator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A &ldquo;transverse axis&rdquo; (Z-Z) extends normal to both the longitudinal and lateral axes, and provides the third or depth dimension of the stator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In addition, as used herein, the &ldquo;longitudinal length&rdquo; refers to a length substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis, the &ldquo;lateral length&rdquo; refers to a length substantially parallel to the lateral axis, and the &ldquo;transverse length&rdquo; refers to a length substantially parallel to the transverse axis. Further, &ldquo;axial&rdquo; and &ldquo;radial&rdquo; are used to describe relative direction, with &ldquo;axial&rdquo; describing a direction that is parallel to the longitudinal length of the stator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and &ldquo;radial&rdquo; describing a direction that is perpendicular the nonrotating center length of the stator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> show axially extending slots <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> formed along the stator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The slots <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are sized and configured to accept and secure at least one strand assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (or vice-versa). Each strand assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a plurality of transposed (e.g. roebelled) conductive (e.g. copper) strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that are sheathed by an insulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (e.g. dacron-glass), with a conductive filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (e.g. mica) disposed about (completely or partially) the insulated <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and an isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> disposed about (completely or partially) the conductive filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As is understood by those skilled in the art, many other types of transpositions, strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, insulators <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and fillers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be used to form the strand assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Additional elements can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is advantageously arranged between the insulated <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (the insulated strands hereinafter referenced as <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) and the filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to electrically isolate the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from the filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. By electrically isolating the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from the filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, high resistance connections among the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are inhibited, if not prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> preferably has at least one of the following characteristics, more preferably most of the following characteristics, and most preferably all of the following characteristics. The isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a dielectric isolate conductive materials and to distribute voltage across it during stator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> operation. The isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is flexible to generally conform to adjacent surfaces and thereby inhibit gaps from forming between itself and the adjacent surfaces. The isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is bondable to adjacent surfaces and thereby inhibits gaps from forming between itself and adjacent surfaces. The isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is capable of withstanding the environment within which it operates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> should have a dielectric strength of at least 300 volts per millimeter and preferably at least 500 volts per millimeter. Suitable dielectrics include polymers such as polyphenylene sulfide, polythiophene, polyacetylene and polypropylene, glass such as E-glass and S-glass, epoxy, resin, fabrics having NOMEX, KEVLAR or similar fibers, mica, and the like. NOMEX and KELVAR are registered trademarks of E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Company. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> should be sufficiently flexible to conform to the irregularities that characterize the insulated strand <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> surface caused by the roebel offsets (e.g. hills and valleys) or other surface irregularities. Suitable materials that may be inherently sufficiently flexible for this purpose include polymers, epoxy, fabric, mica, laminates, and the like. Semi-rigid materials may also be used, as well as rigid materials that are spun laced and the like. These materials are preferably formed as a felt, tape, and the like but can also be embodied in other forms so long as they provide the sufficient flexibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> should be suitably bondable to adhere to adjacent surfaces and thereby inhibit gaps from forming between itself and the adjacent surfaces. Suitable bonding can be achieved by covering the isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with an adhesive <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> such as epoxy, acrylic and the like, or using a material that is inherently suitably bonding. If an adhesive <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is used, the adhesive <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can partially or completely cover the isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and could cover one or more sides or portions of the isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The adhesive <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is advantageously thermally activated so that it cures during the stand assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> curing process, discussed in more detail below. The adhesive need not have a uniform thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> should be capable of withstanding the environment within which it operates, including withstanding stator temperatures of at least 130&deg; C. and preferably at least 155&deg; C. Suitable materials include resins, plastics, NOMEX, epoxies, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Within the exemplary context of use within a generator stator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> preferably comprising a NOMEX spun laced felt material (such as one commercially available by the Electrolock, Inc. company of Hiram, Ohio) and coated on one side with an epoxy adhesive, (such as one commercially available by Eletrolock, Inc.), can meet the above-described preferred characteristics. Other suitable materials include low temperature DACRON and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is preferably arranged between the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to electrically isolate the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> from the filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that the filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> cannot pass or bleed through the porous strand insulation <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> voids and into the strands <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, to achieve this purpose, the isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is preferably placed above the upper surface (Z-Z) of the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and below the lower surface (Z-Z) of the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, but below the upper surface (Z-Z) of the filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and above the lower surface (Z-Z) of the filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The width (X-X) of the isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is advantageously about 0.1 to about 2 inches, preferably about 0.5 inches, wider than the width of the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> so that the ends <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can extend or wrap along the edges <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in order to isolate any filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that may extend along the edges <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> could alternatively be arranged to completely surround the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and not leave the edges <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> uncovered. However, it has been found suitable to arrange the isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as described above with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, and such an arrangement tends to be easier to assembly and cost less than completely surrounding the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as now described with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Of course, if the filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is arranged in a different manner, the isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> should accordingly be arranged differently such that it is between (completely or partially) and isolates the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A section, preferably a side <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, of the isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is covered with the epoxy adhesive <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and adhered to at least a portion of the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. However, as explained above, the adhesive <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> could be placed on two sides <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to adhere to the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, or could not be placed on any side <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to merely interpose (but not adhere to) the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The strand assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be made by first roebelling the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The isolation material <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is then placed on the upper and lower portions of the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> above, or sheathed around the insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>. Next, the filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is placed on the isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to form the strand assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The strand assembly <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is then cured by heating at a temperature of about 150&deg; and a pressure of about 500 psi for about 120 minutes, as is known by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Test Results </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, two conventional coils (A, B), each comprising about 40 roebelled insulated strands <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, were processed in accordance with the above teachings of the present invention and as commonly understood by those skilled in the art. After coil cure, a strand-to-strand test was performed at a test voltage of 250 VDC. All readings were well above 20 Mega ohm and no strand-to-strand low resistance connections were found. A second strand-to-strand test was also performed after forming the coil end turns of the coils A, B, with similar results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The two coils A, B were then insulated with groundwall insulation, and then impregnated and cured. A third strand-to-strand test performed at 250 VDC. All readings were above 100 Mega ohms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The two coils A, B were then power factor tested and the tip-ups were 0.2% and 0.23% with normal values of initial Tan Delta. The normal initial value of Tan Delta (&commat;2.8 kV) was on the order of 1%, indicating no high steady state resistance present in the coils A, B that could result from the isolation of the conductive filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the copper strand potential. Both coils A, B passed a 37.2 kV one-minute voltage ground test. Coil cross section shape was good and both coils passed a tap test, indicating good strand insulation <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> consolidation. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the plot of power factor for three coils: the two above-described coils A, B having a conductive filler <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a third coil C having a non-conductive filler and no isolation layer. The two coils A, B with the isolation layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> passed the power factor tip-up test while the third coil C without the isolation layer did not pass the tip-up test. </paragraph>
