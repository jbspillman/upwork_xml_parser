<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system for separating an entrained immiscible liquid component from a gas stream employing a vessel having a wet gas inlet, a gas outlet and a liquid outlet. At least one vortex tube is supported within the vessel and has a liquid outlet end and a wet gas inlet tangential to its sidewall and arranged so that wet gas rotates within the vortex tube to cause the liquid components to be forced against the interior wall surface by centrifugal action. An orifice plate closes the vortex tube first end and has a concentric gas outlet opening therein. A vortex finder tube is affixed to the orifice plate in communication with the gas outlet opening and extends concentrically within the vortex tube, the vortex finder tube providing an annular area between itself and the vortex tube internal wall. A gas deflector positioned within the annular area, the gas deflector having a downwardly spiraled surface that diverts wet gas downwardly away from the wet gas inlet. One embodiment may include at least one free-fall preventer within the vortex tube positioned below the tangential inlet and having a plurality of spaced apart radially arranged flow diverting vanes positioned in a plane perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the vortex tube and serving to augment the rotation of liquid as it traverses towards the outlet end of the vortex tube. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This disclosure is to an improved vortex tube for use in separating an immiscible liquid component from a gas stream and more particularly for a system and a method of operating a system for separating liquid components from a gas stream. An example of an application of the invention is for separating entrained water from a natural gas stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The subject of the invention generally relates to gas/liquid separators or gas/liquid/solid separators. Separators of this type are typically process vessels that may be at atmospheric or above atmospheric pressures. The main function of the separator system is to segregate immiscible phases of the process stream such as when the process stream is the form of a gas, such as natural gas that carries with it an immiscible liquid component. The function of the separator of this invention is to separate out the liquid component to provide at the output of the separator a gas stream that is relatively free from entrained liquids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Separators for separating liquid components from a gas stream are commonly utilized in the oil and gas industry, specifically in oil and gas production, oil refining and gas processing. While very commonly utilized in the oil and gas industry, separators of this type are also used in the mining industry, chemical plants, water treatment facilities, pulp and paper plants and pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. Separators can be designed to separate a two-phase stream&mdash;that is, a vapor/liquid stream or a three-phase stream&mdash;that is, a vapor/organic liquid/aqueous stream or a four-phase stream&mdash;that is, a vapor/organic liquid/aqueous liquid/solids stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Separation of immiscible components of the stream usually and ultimately depend on the force of gravity. Gravity can be either natural gravity&mdash;that is, the pull of objects towards the center of the earth or created gravitational forces such as represented by centrifugal separators. Natural gravity is usually used by flowing a stream having immiscible components into a vessel which provides a quiescent zone&mdash;that is, a relatively undisturbed environment that allows gravity to act on heavier components of the stream and move them into a downward part of the vessel. This movement has the counteraction of the lighter components of the stream migrating to an upward part of the vessel. In this way, the heavier components&mdash;that is, liquids, can be withdrawn from the lower part of the vessel and the lighter components&mdash;that is, gases, withdrawn from an upper part of the vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another type of gravitational separator utilizes artificial gravity attained by centrifugal force. One way of generating artificial gravity is by the use of a vortex tube. A vortex tube is typically an elongated tube having a cylindrical interior wall that is preferably vertically mounted or at least mounted with a vertically downward tangent. Adjacent an upper end of the vessel is an inlet opening into the vortex tube, the inlet being arranged so that fluids flowing therein tangentially intersect the interior wall of the vortex tube and flow around the interior wall thereby creating centrifugal force that is applied to the components, the centrifugal force serving to move the heavier component&mdash;that is, the liquid component, towards the wall of the vortex tube while the lighter component is forced towards the interior of the vortex tube. In a typical vortex tube the gas is withdrawn from an upper central vortex opening while the liquid component is withdrawn from a liquid outlet in the bottom portion of the vortex tube. The invention herein pertains to improvements to vortex tubes and to methods of using the improved vortex tubes for separation of immiscible components of a gas stream. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Separators are process vessels, commonly pressurized, which segregate immiscible phases of a process stream. They are commonly used in oil and gas production, oil refining, gas processing, mining, chemical plants, waste water treatment, pulp and paper, and pharmaceutical plants. They separate two-phase streams (vapor/liquid), three-phase streams (vapor/organic liquid/aqueous liquid) or four-phase streams (vapor/organic liquid/aqueous liquid/solids). Separators commonly have an inlet momentum absorber or deflector intended to utilize or reduce fluid incoming momentum, and distribute liquid and gas. This energy reduction initiates phase separation inside the separator vessel. These inlet devices are then followed by various types of de-misting, de-foaming, and/or liquid coalescing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The most common separator inlet device is a &ldquo;splash plate&rdquo;&mdash;that is, a flat, curved or dished impingement plate that intercepts the incoming flow stream. Fluids are allowed to rebound in a direction considered least destructive to the quiescence of the bulk phases residing in the vessel. Splash plates are characterized by relatively high rebound turbulence. A diffusion inlet is another generic type of inlet device. It typically divides the flow stream into multiple smaller streams and reduces momentum by gradual enlargement of the flow areas of each stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The invention herein relates to a &ldquo;vortex tube&rdquo; that is frequently utilized in a &ldquo;vortex tube cluster&rdquo;. A vortex tube can be used as a momentum dissipating inlet device and can eliminate other phase separation elements as well. A vortex tube has an inlet through which fluids enter tangentially creating rotational flow. Centrifugal force separates phases within the tube, which then exit, gas from the top through a central gas orifice and liquids from the bottom through peripheral openings. A vortex is formed inside the tube. In a preferred embodiment, the bottom of each tube is submerged below the liquid surface to a depth that prevents the gas vortex from blowing out the bottom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An essential characteristic of a vortex tube is that it uses flow energy constructively to separate phases whereas in impingement and diffusion devices flow energy is counterproductive to separation, and so they seek to dissipate flow energy as non-destructively as is practical. (&ldquo;Destructive&rdquo; refers to the tendency of hydraulic agitation to mix, rather than to separate phases). This invention herein includes an improved vortex tube that is usually employed in a vortex tube cluster. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The disclosure herein covers a vortex tube system which produces optimum performance for a variety of process circumstances and conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> One improvement described herein minimizes fluid shear by shielding the axially flowing gas stream leaving the top of the tube from the feed stream as it enters the tube tangentially. It consists of a &lsquo;vortex finder&rsquo;, which shields the vortex tube outlet stream from disturbance by the inlet stream. It is comprised of a vertical tube the same size as the gas orifice and concentric with the vertical vortex tube and protrudes from the orifice plate on top downward to below the lowest point of the vortex tube entry. This improvement also includes a method of diverting the fluid already rotating circumferentially about the tube as it completes its first rotation from the entering stream. This is done by directing the inlet stream downward using a deflector at such an angle as to miss the tube inlet after one revolution. The deflector diverts the incoming fluid stream downward at the necessary angle. A benefit of using this method is that a smaller amount of liquid mist is carried out of the tube with the gas stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Occasionally the gas flow velocity inside a vortex tube may exceed the ideal design limits, either continuously or intermittently due to slugging. This excessive velocity re-entrains liquid mist, and causes the gas stream to spit coarse mist droplets out of the gas orifice. Uncontained, these droplets can result in separator liquid carryover. A second improvement described herein is a method for diverting the gas outlet from the vortex tube downward so that any entrained liquid is directed toward the standing liquid phase. A curved outlet tube is installed on top of the gas orifice to catch these large droplets and direct them harmlessly downward towards the standing liquid. The deflecting tube must arch down sufficiently to create this downward velocity component but does not need to point directly down. If space limits the curve of the tube, it can be modified as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The benefit of this device is that it allows a smaller tube cluster, making the unit more competitive and giving a greater flow turndown to the device without carryover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the operation of a vortex tube it is important to control the flow of liquid as it is discharged from the tube bottom. This is done by changing flow direction&mdash;that is, to direct the liquid discharge from the tube upward instead of outward by using a tube-on-tube device. This is important if there is any gas carryunder from the tube. Gas exiting the bottom of the tube, if allowed to radiate outward, can propel gas-laden liquid towards the liquid outlet, resulting in carryunder of gas from the separator vessel. The tube-on-tube design projects this flow upward so that gas more quickly reaches the gas-liquid surface. This tends to keep the gas entrainment localized, allowing a quiet zone in the separator to be more gas-free. The benefit of the tube-on-tube design results in more gas-free liquid leaving the separator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The liquid release point for a typical vortex tube is located well beneath the liquid surface. However, in low level situations or at start-up, the bottom of the tube may not be submerged. The tube-on-tube arrangement establishes tube-bottom submergence as soon as any liquid is produced. A resulting benefit of incorporating the tube-on-tube system is that during separator startup, or during low liquid level excursions, the vortex tube liquid discharge will remain submerged and will therefore function normally. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Another benefit of the tube-on-tube system is that it keeps disturbance of the oil-water interface more localized around the tube. In three-phase separators the top of the outer tube is typically located below the oil-water interface. An improvement to the tube-on-tube system is the deflector ring. If the liquid release of a tube-on-tube system is near the liquid or interface surface, the deflector ring deflects the upward momentum into a horizontal direction. By the time this deflection occurs, gas has been released and velocity has slowed by natural diffusion. This reduces surface disturbance and phase re-entrainment. The benefit is a reduction in cross-contamination between liquid phases leaving the separator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> To diffuse liquid discharged from a cluster of vortex tubes, a liquid energy absorber may be used that is in the form of a box that surrounds the entire bottom portion of a tube cluster. The box has sides, a top and a bottom, some or all of which are of perforated plate. A liquid energy absorber system reduces turbulent spots in separator liquid residence sections by diffusing vortex tube exit velocities and reduces channeling by improving fluid distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In vertical separators or in large diameter horizontal separators the vertical height of vortex tubes can be significant. When this occurs, liquid separated within the tubes must fall a long distance down the tube wall. As it plunges, gravity accelerates its velocity such that when it finally impinges on the standing liquid, its high momentum re-entrains gas into the liquid phases. Concurrently, in tall vortex tubes, wall friction slows down rotational liquid velocity causing a loss of centrifugal separation as the liquid progresses down the tube. Thus at the bottom of the tube, the liquid velocity direction is nearly vertically downward. To alleviate this problem, a system employing free-fall preventers is used. The benefit of the free-fall preventer system is that gas re-entrainment and foaming are greatly minimized or eliminated, and a higher average g-force is maintained in the vortex tubes to improve phase separation within the tubes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows in cross-section the bottom end portion of a vortex tube, the vortex tube extending below a liquid level established within a vessel. A portion of the vessel is shown. Spaced from the lower end of the vortex tube is a bottom diverter plate that serves to spread the flow of liquid exiting from the vortex tube. The bottom diverter plate also serves to decrease the possibility that the gas vortex formed within the diverter tube can elongate to extend out the lower end of the vortex tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is a view of the bottom portion of a vortex tube as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> but showing the use of a tube-on-tube attachment that provides a short length annular space at the lower end of the vortex tube through which liquids passing out of the vortex tube travels. The tube-on-tube arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> decreases the turbulence of the fluid flowing from the vortex tube and further decreases the possibility that the gas vortex formed within the tube can extend out the lower end thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is like <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> in that it shows the lower end portion of a vortex tube. In these figures, the liquid accumulation within the bottom of the separator vessel is shown as being a two-phase arrangement&mdash;that is, with a lower heavier phase, such as water and an upper lighter liquid phase such as oil with gas in the vessel being above the lighter liquid or oil phase. In FIG. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, the upper end of the tube-on-tube attachment discharges into the denser liquid phase whereas in the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the length of the tube-on-tube attachment is such that the upper end is above the liquid level of the lightest liquid phase so that liquid passing therethrough is distributed on top of the upper liquid phase. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> system for separating entrained liquid components from a gas stream is diagrammatically illustrated. Generally speaking, the system of this invention employs one or more vortex tubes and the invention is specifically concerned with the construction of vortex tubes. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is more or less representative of the state of the prior art to which the principles of this invention apply with the intent of providing vortex tube systems to attain more effective separation of entrained immiscible liquid components from a gas stream. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates diagrammatically a vessel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which can be, as an example, a horizontal cylindrical vessel or a vertical cylindrical vessel or any other type of vessel that provides a quiescent internal zone <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a wet gas inlet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a liquid outlet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a gas outlet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In the typical operation of a separator as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> liquid level <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is established within a lower portion of the vessel, the liquid being drawn off at a rate to approximately maintain the liquid level <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> while gas is removed from an upper portion of the vessel through an upper gas outlet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In the typical operation of the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> liquid level control means (not shown) is used to control the rate of liquid discharge so as to maintain a liquid level <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a horizontal cross-sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> showing a fluid injection conduit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that receives the wet gas from wet gas inlet <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the vessel of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and showing a plurality of vertically positioned vortex tubes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Each vortex tube has a wet gas inlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in the vertical sidewall thereof. Wet gas under pressure flows through an opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in each of the vortex tubes and enters the vortex tube tangentially&mdash;that is, at a tangent to the interior sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of each of the vortex tubes. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a cross-sectional view of a single vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that is representative of the other vortex tubes shown in the cluster. The upper end of each vortex tube is closed with a top plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a concentric gas outlet opening <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> therein. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the bottom end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of each vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is open to admit the free-flow of liquid out of the lower bottom end. A horizontally positioned bottom diverter plate is supported to the vortex tube sidewall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and spaced from the bottom <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the vortex tube to allow a circumferential liquid outlet passageway <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Bottom diverter plate is typically supported to vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by spaced apart stand-off&apos;s that are not shown but can be in the form of short-length metal rods welded to the interior or exterior surface of the cylindrical wall of the vortex tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A vortex tube functions to separate an immiscible liquid component from a wet gas stream by utilizing artificially created gravity&mdash;that is, centrifugal force. Inlet fluids enter the fluids injection tube <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and flows through opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> into the interior of the vortex tube tangentially so that the fluids swirl at a rapid rate within the vortex tube as illustrated by the dotted lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The swirling gas causes entrained liquids to be expelled and to encounter the vortex tube internal cylindrical wall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> where the liquids accumulate and fall downwardly by gravity to ultimately flow out of the vortex tube through the liquid outlet passageway <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The swirling gas component of the fluid stream having substantially less density than the entrained liquid component migrates to the axial center of each vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and flows out through the upper concentric gas outlet <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The swirling gas is in the form of a gas vortex that takes the geometrical pattern as shown by the vortex boundary <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Thus <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are representative of the state of the art to which this disclosure applies to provide the improvements to obtain more effective separation of an entrained immiscible liquid component from a wet gas stream. Systems can operate with one vortex tube which is typically oriented vertically but that can operate as long as it has a vertical downward tangent however, a vertical operation is preferred. A vessel can include a single vortex tube or a cluster of vortex tubes as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> or a plurality of clusters of vortex tubes depending on the volume of wet gas being treated and the arrangement of the vessel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The length of vortex tubes can vary in length; where long length vortex tubes are employed a vertically oriented vessel may be preferred but where shorter length vortex tubes are employed typically a horizontal vessel offers the most economic housing for the separation system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The improvements of the invention are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 16</cross-reference> as will now be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an improvement of the basic concept of a vortex tube separator in the form of a tubular vortex finder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> having an upper end connected with top plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and an internal tubular wall <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that communicates with concentric gas outlet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Vortex finder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> minimizes fluid shear by shielding the axially flowing gas stream that leaves the top of the vortex tube from the feed stream as it enters the vortex tube through tangential inlet opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Stated another way, vortex finder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> shields the vortex tube outlet stream from disturbance by the inlet stream. The lower end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of vortex finder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> should preferably extend below the lowest point of the vortex tube entry&mdash;that is, below the lowest point of tangential inlet opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is an isometric view of a portion of a vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that includes the improvements of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>&mdash;that is, a short length tubular vortex finder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> but in addition includes a sloped deflector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Deflector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> fits in the annular area <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> exterior of vortex finder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and within vortex tube internal cylindrical sidewall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and is spirally sloped downwardly so that the incoming gas stream that enters the vortex tube through opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> but not seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) is spirally deflected downwardly by the sloped deflector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The sloped deflector diverts the incoming wet gas stream downward at the necessary angle. A benefit of using the sloped defector <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is that it minimizes liquid droplet break-up caused by shearing as the rotating stream intersects the incoming stream. As a result a smaller amount of liquid mist is carried out of the tube with the gas stream that passes upwardly through vortex finder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Occasionally the gas flow velocity inside a vortex tube may exceed the ideal design limits either continuously, or intermittently due to slugging. Excess flow velocity of gas re-entrains liquid mist and causes the gas stream to spit course mist droplets out of the gas orifice, that is out of the orifice <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> or out of the vortex finder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>. Uncontained, these droplets can result in separator liquid carry-over&mdash;that is, the liquid that is contained in the rapidly discharged gas is carried upwardly into the vessel into the compartment where gas is intended to accumulate instead of downwardly into the area where the liquid should accumulate. To overcome this problem, a method of diverting the gas outlet from the vortex tube downwardly so that any entrained liquid is directed toward the standing liquid phase is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7, 8</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with top plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the vortex tube extending from and receiving the inlet of gas from wet gas injector conduit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Affixed to top plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a gas flow diverter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that is a bent tubular member having an inlet end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> connected to the concentric dry gas outlet in a top plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the two being curved so that its outlet end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is directed in a downward tangent that is, gas flow through gas flow diverter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> makes a transition of more than 90&deg;. By the downward diversion of the gas passing out of the vortex tube, any entrained droplets are directed downwardly toward the liquid that collects in the bottom of the vessel, such as the liquid shown in the bottom of vessel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that has a liquid level <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is an elevational view of the top portion only of the vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> showing the tubular dry gas flow diverter in which the outlet end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> has a more downward inclination. It can be seen that, if desired, the tubular gas flow diverter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> could include a bend of 180&deg; so that the gas is directed vertically downwardly if desired however, any downward direction imparted to droplets that pass out with the gas is very beneficial in preventing re-entrainment of the liquid with the exiting gas stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows a special application of the gas diverter of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> where the outlet end <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the tubular gas diverter is closely spaced to the internal wall surface <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of a vessel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in an arrangement that does not permit sufficient space to provide a fully arcuate downwardly directed bent tubular gas flow diverter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In this predicament, downward diversion of any fluid droplets carried by the gas stream exiting vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be deflected by use of an angular diversion shield <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> welded or otherwise attached to tubular gas diverter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the operation of a vortex tube it is important to control the flow of liquid being discharged from the lower end of the tube and to prevent the gas vortex formed inside the tube from extending beyond the lower end of the tube and thereby into the liquid chamber in the bottom of the separator vessel. For this purpose, a bottom diverter plate has been used such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and that has previously been described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the bottom diverter plate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> having been described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> An improved method of controlling the fluid flow out the bottom end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of a vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11, 12</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Each of these figures show the lower end portion of the vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> positioned within a vessel having a vessel wall <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the vortex tube lower end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> being below the level of liquid <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 13</cross-reference>, liquid level <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown wherein the separated liquid is of two-phase. For instance, in separating liquid from a gas stream in the petroleum industry it is common that the separated liquid be co-mingled water and oil and preferably these liquids are separately removed from the interior of the separator vessel&mdash;that is, a separator can be operated where all the separated liquids are discharged in a common stream but in many applications it is desirable that if the liquid is of two-phases, the two phases be separately discharged. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 13</cross-reference>, the liquid is in two-phase providing a water phase <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a liquid level <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A and on top of the water level an oil phase that has the top liquid level <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In any event, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 through 11</cross-reference>, the lower end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> extends into the bottom liquid phase&mdash;that is, below the intermediate liquid level <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A. If there is any possibility that a high liquid flow rate from vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can cause entrained gas to flow out the lower end <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, of vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, if allowed to radiate outwardly, can propel gas-laden liquid toward the liquid outlet, resulting in a carryunder of gas from the separator vessel. To prevent this, a tube-on-tube arrangement is exceedingly useful, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 through 13</cross-reference>. This system requires a short length exterior tubular member <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that has an internal wall <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of a diameter greater than the external diameter of vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> providing an annular area <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> therebetween. The lower end of tubular member <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is closed with a bottom plate <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> so that all fluids exiting the lower end of the vortex tube pass upwardly through the annular area <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and are dispersed around the exterior of vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, the top end <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of tubular members <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is below the intermediate liquid level <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A. In the embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, the top end <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is above liquid level <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that fluid flows out on top of the level of liquid and is spread over the liquid contained in the bottom of the vessel. It can be seen that the length of tubular member <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> could be varied according to design requirements and, as an example, could be of an intermediate length between that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference> so that the top end <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is above the intermediate liquid level <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A but below the top liquid level <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows an alternate arrangement wherein there is provided, in addition to the tube-on-tube method a horizontal distributer plate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that is positioned above the top end <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of tubular member <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. This planer horizontal distributer plate <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> extends radially around vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for a full 360&deg; in the practice of the invention. Instead of the circumferential distributer plate being horizontal as shown in element <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the circumferential distributor plate can be arcuate as shown in the right side of vortex tube of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, the arcuate circumferential distributer plate being indicated by the numeral <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Whether a horizontal circumferential distributer plate or an arcuate circumferential distributor plate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, any disturbance of the oil/water interface caused by liquid exiting the lower end of the vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is more localized around the tube. If the liquid release of the tube-on-tube system is near the liquid interface surface, the deflector ring either <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> deflects the upper momentum of the flowing liquid into a horizontal direction. This reduces the surface disturbance either the surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>A or the top liquid surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to thereby reduce phase re-entrainment. The benefit of the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a reduction in cross-contamination between liquid phases leaving the separator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows a cluster of vortex tubes as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with the installation of a liquid energy absorber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which also may be referred to as a liquid energy diffuser. The energy absorber or diffuser is generally indicated by the numeral <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and is in the form of a container having a top <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and four sidewalls <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, only two of which are seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> and a bottom <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The sidewalls are perforated at <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. If desired the top <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and/or bottom <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> could, in like manner, be perforated. Liquid energy absorber <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> reduces turbulent spots in the liquid collected in the bottom of the separator by diffusing the exits from the vortex tube and reduces channeling of fluid flow by improved fluid distribution. While in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the liquid energy absorber is shown as a box enclosure that is, in a horizontal plane rectangular, the enclosure could be circular, spherical or any other shape the only requirement being that the liquid energy absorber provide a closed area encompassing the lower ends of each vortex tube making up a cluster of vortex tubes to diffuse and break up fluid channel flow paths that might otherwise be created within the fluid collected in the bottom of a separator vessel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows an alternate embodiment of a vortex tube separator system in which there is positioned within the vortex tube one or more free-fall preventers, the free-fall preventers being generally indicated by the numeral <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is an isometric view of a free-fall preventer that is preferably formed of a short length center tube <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> with an open tubular passageway <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> therethrough. Radially extending around the external circumference of center tube <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are a plurality of vanes <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. These vanes extend out to contact the internal cylindrical wall of vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In vertical separators or in large diameter horizontal separators, the vertical height of vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be significant. When this occurs, liquid separated within the tubes must fall a long distance down the tube wall. As the liquid plunges, gravity accelerates this velocity such that when it finally impinges on the standing liquid that would be approximately at the height of liquid level <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, its high momentum tends to re-entrain gas into the liquid phase. Concurrently, in such tall vortex tubes wall friction slows down the rotational liquid velocity causing a loss of centrifugal separation as the liquid progresses down the tube. Thus, at the bottom of the tube the liquid velocity direction is nearly vertically downward. To alleviate this problem the free-fall preventers <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> can be employed. The benefit of the use of free-fall preventers <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is that gas re-entrainment and foaming are greatly minimized or eliminated and a higher average centrifugal force is maintained in the liquids swirling within the vortex tube. Note that swirling gas that has not yet migrated to the center of the tube passes downwardly through the vanes and as it passes downwardly, additional swirling action is imparted. Gas that migrates toward the center of the vortex passes freely upwardly through the open passageway <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in center tube <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> of each of the free-fall preventers and thus the gas can flow outwardly through the concentric gas outlet opening <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the top of each of the vortex tubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows use of two spaced apart free-fall preventers but only one may have been employed or more than two may be employed according to the length of the vortex tube <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The improved separator system of this invention can be practiced employing various combinations of the improved vortex tube features as has been described herein according to design parameters dictated by the particular entrained liquid verses volume of gas in the wet gas stream, by the nature of the entrainment&mdash;that is, whether in relatively small or relatively large droplets, the nature of the liquid whether heavy such as water or relatively light such hydrocarbon condensate, and many other parameters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The claims and the specification describe the invention presented and the terms that are employed in the claims draw their meaning from the use of such terms in the specification.
