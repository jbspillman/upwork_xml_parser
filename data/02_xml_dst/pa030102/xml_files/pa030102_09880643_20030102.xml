<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Aspirators are well known in the art. They come in various configurations, sizes and have numerous options. However, there are no aspirators with a sensor to detect fluid level within a patient&apos;s esophagus lumen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Numerous innovations for an aspirator have been provided in the prior art that are described as follows. Even though these innovations may be suitable for the specific individual purposes to which they address, they differ from the present invention as hereinafter contrasted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No., 5,989,208, titled, Therapeutic ultrasound system, invented by Nita, an ultrasound system is disclosed having a catheter including an elongate flexible catheter body having at least one lumen extending longitudinally there through. The catheter further includes an ultrasound transmission member extending longitudinally through the lumen of the catheter body, the ultrasound transmission member having a proximal end connectable to an ultrasound transducer. The catheter also includes a distal head positioned on the distal end of the ultrasound transmission member. The catheter also has a coil with a proximal end connected to the distal end of the catheter body, and a distal end connected to the distal head. The coil defines a lumen communicating with the lumen of the catheter body. The ultrasound system also includes a sonic connector for coupling the ultrasound transmission member to the transducer. Different configurations are disclosed for the distal head and the ultrasound transmission member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No., 5,651,769, titled, Method for retrieving pancreatic juice utilizing and endoscopically wire-guided catheter, invented by Waxman, et. al., a method for accurately and quickly positioning a double lumen gastroduodenal tube into predetermined locations utilizing an endoscopically placed guide wire to retrieve duodenal fluid uncontaminated by gastric fluid, with little or no discomfort to the patient, and minimal radiation exposure. Specifically, an endoscope is passed through a patent&apos;s esophagus and stomach into the duodenum such that its distal end is located at a predetermined location, such as the fourth portion of the duodenum. While the endoscope is held in place, a guide-wire is passed through its center instrument channel to position a distal end of the guide-wire adjacent to the distal end of the endoscope. The endoscope is then withdrawn from the patient, leaving the guide-wire. A double lumen gastroduodenal tube is then threaded over the guide-wire such that gastric ports are aligned with the stomach and duodenal ports are aligned with the fourth portion of the duodenum so that upon aspiration of the gastric ports, the gastric fluid is prevented from entering the duodenum and contaminating the duodenal fluid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No., 5,456,251, titled, Remote sensing tonometric catheter apparatus and method, invented by Fiddian-Green, a tonometric device for use in hollow viscus tonometry and remote sensing of patient fluid parameters is disclosed in combination with a secondary apparatus, such as a urinary catheter, a nasogastric sump apparatus, or a feeding tube, for example. The device is capable of monitoring certain critical fluid properties of interest, such as oxygen gases and carbon dioxide gases in the wall tissue itself of the patient&apos;s organ, rather than monitoring such properties in a lumen of the organ. A walled sampling chamber, which is preferably an inflated balloon member, is provided on an elongated tube, with provisions for positioning the sampling chamber in direct contact with a wall portion of the patient&apos;s internal organ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No., 5,397,302, titled, Method of using a dual lumen biliary catheter, invented by Weaver, et. al., an improved biliary catheter is disclosed. The catheter comprises a tube constructed from a polyurethane or nylon having a durometer of about 60D and coated with a hydrophilic coating to provide lubricity, kink resistance and suppleness. The tube has substantially cylindrical sidewalls and a proximal end for connection to a source of contrast medium and a distal end for entry into the common biliary duct of a patient. The tube contains a first crescent-shaped lumen channel extending between the proximal and the distal end, the first lumen channel transporting the contrast medium from the source of contrast medium to the biliary duct; and a second circular lumen channel extending between the proximal end and said distal end for facilitating the insertion and threading of a spring wire guide into the dual-lumen biliary catheter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No., 5,029,580, titled, Medical aspirating apparatus with multi-lumen catheter tube and methods, invented by Radford, et. al., an aspirating/ventilating or aspirating apparatus comprising multi-lumen catheter tubes, for evacuation of lung secretions and for other functions as well. Two and three lumen catheter tubes which comprise three unique distal catheter end structures are disclosed. Material comprising oxygen-containing gas is introduced into the lungs under positive pressure through a first lumen of the catheter tube at a predetermined rate while secretions (and gas) are simultaneously aspirated from the lung into a second lumen by force of negative pressure. Oxygen gas inflow is controlled to equal gas outflow to maintain the partial pressure of oxygen into the lung at a high respiratory level. In a first distal catheter end structure, an oxygen-containing gas is introduced through the first lumen as a circumscribing jet around the second lumen to provide fluid flow turbulence external to a second lumen to improve homogenization of localized secretions resulting in more efficient aspiration. In a second distal catheter end structure, oxygen gas inflow is introduced into a common chamber at the distal end of the catheter, where effluent secretions are being aspirated, causing gas produced homogenization in the turbulence created by influent/effluent flow at the common distal catheter entry/exit port. In a third distal catheter end structure in a three lumen catheter, provision is made for independent introduction of medication and/or lavage solutions into the lungs via a third lumen into a common entry/exit port. Provision is made for monitoring pressures and flow rates through the catheter tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In U.S. Pat. No., 4,300,550, titled, Suction and oxygenation catheter, invented by Gandi, et. al., a catheter for use in simultaneous tracheal oxygenating and aspirating a patient. The catheter includes an elongated flexible tube arrangement adapted to have at least one end portion extended into the tracheal passage of a patient. The tube arrangement has two separate lumens there through. One lumen has at least one opening in the one end portion and is adapted to be connected at the other end of the tube arrangement to a source of suction to permit aspiration of material from the patient through the one lumen. The other lumen has at least one opening at the other end and is adapted to be connected at the other end to a source of oxygen to permit simultaneous oxygenating of the patient through the other lumen while the patient is aspirated through the one lumen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The aforementioned patents differ from the present invention because the patented inventions lack the following features: Aspirate Sensor Device with stainless steel electrodes. An Activation Device electrically connected to the Aspirate Sensor Device. The Activation Device has three ports: a short tube port, suction trap port, and open port. The Activation Device connects to a standard suction trap via the suction trap port. Three chambers located within the Activation Device. The three chambers are short tube chamber, open tube chamber, and suction trap chamber. A valve door separates the open and short tube chambers. In the open position, the open chamber is continuous with the suction trap chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Numerous innovations for an aspirator have been provided in the prior art that are adapted to be used. Even though these innovations may be suitable for the specific individual purposes to which they address, they would not be suitable for the purposes of the present invention as heretofore described. </paragraph>
