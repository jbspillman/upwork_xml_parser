<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Many organizations conduct benchmarking studies to improve effectiveness of their processes, such as order management, new product development, customer satisfaction, and the like. Consulting companies collect and sell benchmarking data. Traditionally, benchmarking data has been gathered by personal contact through written or telephone surveys. This process is labor intensive, time consuming and expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Prior benchmarking studies take a considerable time to gather the answer data and process it into meaningful categories for a particular study. Accordingly, a considerable time lapses before a study respondent obtains any benchmark results or reports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for a rapid benchmarking data gathering methodology and system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a method and system that is capable of conducting a plurality of benchmarking studies rapidly with quick feedback of benchmark results to the respondents of a study. Interactive sessions are conducted online with respondents of the studies with a questionnaire. The questionnaires of all the studies differ in content and format, but have a common data structure. A database is built with the response data of the questionnaire. Benchmarking reports that utilize the response data are provided upon request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A file is built for each study populated with the answers of each respondent for that study. Broadly stated, a study file contains the text of the questions, the validation rules, formatting, and names of items to look up in a database. The database includes information on the respondents, what questionnaire they should be completing, what questions are in that questionnaire, what responses are possible, and the actual responses given by the respondents. The study files are organized according to the data structure. During an interactive session, a respondent can be given a feedback of comparative data concerning a question the respondent has answered. This feedback can be instant. The answer data in the study files is processed by keying on the data structure to produce benchmark reports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the invention, the data structure includes a question element that has question attributes and an answer element that has answer attributes. The study files are organized and processed according to these question elements and answer elements. The common data structure of the questionnaires has a number of important advantages. The questionnaires of different studies can be rapidly designed as to content and format according to the common data structure. The study files can be built and populated with answer data and processed for benchmark reports by programs that do not need to be changed from one study to another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention satisfies the aforementioned need with an online method and system that gathers benchmarking data and provides benchmark results or reports via a network, such as the Internet, the World Wide Web (Web), or other communication network Thus, the method and system of the present invention greatly simplifies the collection of benchmarking data, and, at the same time, enhances the value thereof.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is interconnected via a network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with a database <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a plurality of client devices <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may also communicate directly with database <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as shown by a dashed line <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be any computer, known presently or in the future, that has a capability of communicating via network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be a single computer or several computers connected in a distributed computing system via network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or via a local area network (not shown). Database <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be any database and may be a single database or a plurality of databases. Network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be any network, known presently or in the future, such as an Internet, an Intranet, a World Wide Web (Web) or the like. Network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may include wired, wireless, and/or satellite links and the like. Client devices <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be any devices, known presently or in the future, such as a personal computer, a telephone, a hand held computing device or other device with a browser capability for communicating via network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a communications unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a memory interconnected via a bus <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Memory <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes an operating system <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a benchmark study program <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, file builder program <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a benchmark analysis program <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Operating system <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> includes the necessary code to cause processor <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to execute benchmark study program <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, file builder program <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and benchmark analysis program <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and to communicate via communications unit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with client devices <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, online sessions can be conducted directly with client devices <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> without using network <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> runs benchmark study program <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, file builder program <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and benchmark analysis program <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to conduct benchmark studies, build files for the studies and provide benchmark analysis reports. The questionnaires of each study differ from those of other studies in content and format, but employ a standardized data structure. The standardized data structure provides the important advantages of ease in designing a questionnaire, the use of the same benchmark study program <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, file builder program <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and benchmark analysis program <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for all of the studies and the rapid launch of new benchmark studies. This greatly simplifies the conduct of benchmark studies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a number of sample question styles for a typical questionnaire are shown. Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> category style question <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> asks a respondent to identify from a list <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> a business category for the respondent&apos;s company. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> box style question <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has an answer box <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. According to an aspect of the invention, a respondent is given instant feedback after completing the questionnaire. Thus, box style question <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> asks the respondent to insert in box <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> the number of employees the respondent&apos;s company had over the past year. The respondent enters number &ldquo;2,004&rdquo;. At the end of the study, benchmark study program <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> responds by presenting the respondent with an average of &ldquo;29,984.5&rdquo; for a response of 47 respondents. This type of instant feedback is advantageous as it can be immediately seen how respondent&apos;s company stacks up against other respondent companies in the business area identified for category style question <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> check style question <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes check boxes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> for the respondent to indicate a yes or no answer. Another aspect is that benchmark study program <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> provides benchmark results only for the questions that the respondent answers. This serves as an incentive to the respondent to answer the questions fully and accurately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> category style question <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a list of categories <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> from which the respondent is to select one or more categories of business areas. When selected, the respondent activates an add button <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to display the selected categories in an important business areas box <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. A remove button allows the respondent to remove a business area from important business areas box if there is a change of mind. An add business area box <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> allows the respondent to add a business area not included in list <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The entered business area is transferred from add business area box <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to business area box <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> by operation of an add button <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> categorized response style question <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> has a question element <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and an answer element <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Answer element <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is shown as a table that includes a column <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of business area categories (selected, for example, from business area list <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) and answer columns <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Question element <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> asks the respondent to rank the business area categories of column <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> by relative importance to the success of respondent&apos;s company in answer column <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Question element <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> also asks the respondent to rate respondent&apos;s company for each business category over a range that extends from below industry levels at one end to above industry levels at the other end. For example, the business development category row <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> has a range <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> with seven boxes <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. If the respondent doesn&apos;t know the relative industry ranking, a box <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> in answer column <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is checked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The questionnaires of the various studies can use one or more of the above question styles or other styles. The questionnaires of the various studies share a common data structure. The data structure has question elements and answer elements. A question element has various attributes that together with the necessity thereof are set forth in Table 1 below.

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> An example of a question text attribute is question element <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. An example of an answer attribute is answer box <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of question <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Answer element <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is an example of a categorized response attribute and also of a verify group element. The only question attribute that is required is either an answer attribute or a categorized responses attribute. The other attributes are optional. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The verify group attribute is generally used together with the categorized responses attribute. An example is when all answers in a question must total to a certain number, such as the ranking for answer column <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. A verify group attribute has a name, a test value and a user description. The name of the verify group attribute is unique (relative to other verify groups in the questionnaire). An example of a name is &ldquo;importance&rdquo; in column <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The test value of the verify group attribute is the total sum value, which is 100 for the categorized responses style question <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The user description attribute for the verify group is a description given to the user if the responses do not meet the verification test. For example, the user description attribute is part of the text in an error message dialog box that is presented to the respondent. After the respondent closes the dialog box, a red flag appears next to the question that caused the problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The data structure answer elements must have either a text box response part, a single choice part, a multiple-choice part, or a Boolean response part. Also, an answer element will have zero or more verify group parts. Verify single indicates that any given response must meet certain rules (e.g., between 0 and 100). Verify group indicates that a set of responses share a common rule (e.g., they must add up to 100). Verify single and verify group are optional elements. On the other hand, text, single choice, multiple choice and Boolean specify the kind of answer expected and are required elements. An example of a text box response part is answer box <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of question style <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. An example of a multiple-choice part is question <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) that has multiple-choice boxes <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Boxes <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are also an example of a Boolean response part. An example of a verify single part is box <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). The respondent is not permitted to enter a negative number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> An answer element has several attributes, which are set forth with the necessity thereof in Table 2 below.

<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> data structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown for the questionnaire and response data for the benchmark studies. Data structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a user identification table <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a questionnaire data table <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, an answer data table <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and a resource data table <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. User identification table <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes data for the authentication of a user, such as user name, password, corporation (and subsidiary or division) that user represents and user type (e.g., enterprise, administrator and the like). Questionnaire data table <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> includes questionnaire data, such as user identification, questionnaire name and file for that user, last date of answer entries, completion date and start date. Answer data table includes answer data, such as the questionnaire identity, and answer list for that questionnaire, raw answer data for the questionnaire and resource data. Resource data table <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> includes resource information, such as resource description, group description and group answer data. For example, resource data table <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> contains answer data (or pointers thereto) for categorized response answers, verify group answers and the like, for the respondents of the group of which the user is a member. The group is identified by the respondent&apos;s answer to category style question <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, benchmark study program <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> begins an interactive session with a respondent at step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, which authenticates the respondent for a study. When the respondent has been authenticated, step <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> serves the questionnaire for the study to the respondent. Step <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> records the answer data when entered by the respondent. Step <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> determines if the respondent is finished. If not, step <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is repeated. If yes, step <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> determines if the questionnaire has been completed. If yes, step <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> determines if any answers require feedback and, if so, gets comparative data via resource data table <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and presents it to the respondent, as for question <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. When the comparative data has been presented, or if no comparative data is required or if step <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> determines the questionnaire is not yet completed, step <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> records completion status for tables <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and benchmark study program <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is then exited. The respondent is finished when all expected answer data of the questionnaire has been entered or earlier if the respondent signs off before completion. If earlier, step <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> records the incomplete status for this respondent so that work on the questionnaire may be retrieved if the respondent later desires to resume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, file builder program <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> begins with step <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> getting answer data for the next question. Step <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> compares the answer data with the answer elements and attributes that are expected for the current question. If not okay, step <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> gives notice of the error. This notice can be sent to the respondent by step <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> or by benchmark program <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> dependent on the design of the software system. If step <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> finds that the answer data is okay, step <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> records the answer elements in the database according to the data structure organization. Step <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> determines if the current question is the last one. If not, step <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> determines if the respondent is finished (finished without completion). If not, steps <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> are repeated. When either step <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> determines the last question has been answered or step <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> determines that the respondent is finished, file builder program <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is exited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, benchmark analysis program <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> begins with step <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> determining that an authorized request has been received. Step <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> then processes the question element and answer element data of the study file in accordance with the requested analysis. When step <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> completes the processing, step <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> generates and sends a benchmark report to the requestor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that although benchmark study program <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, file builder program <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and benchmark analysis program are shown as separate program entities, they may be integrated into a lesser number of programs or split into a greater number of programs. Also those skilled in the art will appreciate that the file for a study can reside in whole or in part in a cache of computer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and/or solely in database <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The present invention having been thus described with particular reference to the preferred forms thereof, it will be obvious that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
