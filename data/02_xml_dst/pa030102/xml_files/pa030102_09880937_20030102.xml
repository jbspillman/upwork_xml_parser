<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a method of inhibiting intestinal carbohydrate absorption in mammals and a dietetic preparation for use in such a method. More particularly the present invention is concerned with the administration of &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component, whose intestinal absorption is sodium dependent, in an amount effective to achieve inhibition of intestinal carbohydrate absorption. The &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acids used in accordance with the invention can be represented by the general formula R&mdash;C(OH)COOH&mdash;R. Citric acid is an example of an &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid which may suitably be employed in the present method. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Reduction of carbohydrate absorption in the intestine of animals, especially humans, is nutritionally and medically of great importance. Reduction of absorption can for example facilitate body weight management, e.g. as part of a method of treating obesity, and can be advantageous for subjects suffering form diabetes or hypoglycaemic state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Reduced carbohydrate absorption by the intestine is thought to reduce fat formation. In a normal diet many carbohydrate containing components are present. During digestion of the carbohydrates, monosaccharides, e.g. glucose, will be formed which can be readily absorbed by the intestine. The absorbed glucose can subsequently be converted to water and carbon dioxide, glycogen, glycol or fatty acids, the last predominantly occuring when an excess of glucose is present, e.g. when a vast amount of carbohydrates is consumed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Many preparations have been proposed to reduce carbohydrate digestion either alone or in combination with components capable of reducing absorption of the carbohydrates in the intestine. Such compositions will ultimately result in the reduced in vivo availability of glucose, thereby reducing the formation of adipose tissue, contributing to weight loss, reducing blood glucose levels, decreasing fluctuations in blood glucose levels etc. These effects are advantageous for e.g. obese or diabetic subjects and subjects having the desire to maintain a low weight or desirable silhouette. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Reduction of carbohydrate digestion can for example be accomplished by the ingestion of components capable of reducing digestive enzyme activity, e.g. by reducing pancreatic amylase and &agr;-glucosidase activity. &agr;-Glucosidase converts non-absorbable dietary starch and sucrose into absorbable monosaccharides. Inhibitors of &agr;-glucosidase inhibit such conversion, resulting in the delay of formation and absorption of monosaccharides. Therefore, these inhibitors reduce the concentration of post-prandial blood glucose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An amylase inhibitor reduces the activity of human pancreatic &agr;-amylase and moderates the digestion of ingested starch by inhibiting the conversion of carbohydrates into smaller carbohydrate polymers, thus inhibiting an increase in blood glucose level and reducing insulin secretion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,705 discloses an &agr;-glucosidase inhibitor mildly inhibiting alpha-glucosidase locally present in the micro-villus of the small intestine. The inhibitor delays the digestion of starch, starch-derived oligosaccharides and sucrose, so that the inhibitor has an action of suppressing rapid increase in blood glucose level and an action of suppressing insulin secretion at a lower level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,904 discloses a method for treating glycometabolism disorders in a mammal in need thereof, which comprises administering to such mammal a therapeutically effective amount of an insulin sensitivity enhancer in combination with an &agr;-glucosidase inhibitor, wherein said &agr;-glucosidase inhibitor can be acarbose, voglibose and miglitol, and the insulin sensitivity enhancer can be troglitazone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> JP2000103742 discloses an &agr;-amylase inhibitor obtained from extracts of Gambir, a material obtained from the root of Sassafras albidum, having high safety and capable of suppressing absorption of carbohydrates and preventing obesity, diabetes, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Reduction of absorption of glucose in the intestine can for example be accomplished by intestinal absorption reducing components such as gymnemic acid, which can be extracted from <highlight><italic>Gymnema sylvestre </italic></highlight>as reported by Shimizu et al. &ldquo;Suppression of glucose absorption by some fractions extracted from <highlight><italic>Gymnema sylvestre </italic></highlight>leaves&rdquo;, J. Vet Med. Sci (1997), 59(4), 245-251. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Combinations of components capable of reducing the activity of intestinal carbohydrate degrading enzymes and components which reduce the intestinal absorption of glucose are for example described in WO0117369, which discloses the combination of &agr;-amylase inhibitors, for example plant protein derived &agr;-amylase inhibitors and absorption inhibitors e.g. inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Although many of the compositions reducing carbohydrate absorption are know in the art and available on the market, still such compositions are open to improvements, particularly because of undesirable side effects occurring when administering these compositions in substantial amounts. Commercially available compositions that include effective enzyme inhibitors and/or components which reduce intestinal glucose absorption are found to cause insufficient water uptake, potentially resulting in dehydration. Glucose is co-transported over the intestinal wall with salt, and thus fulfils the important role of increasing the cellular concentration of salt within the intestine and inducing osmotic water transport from the intestine to the cells. Reduced glucose transport. e.g. due to reduced availability of glucose or inhibition of carbohydrase enzymes, will result in reduced water transport. The resulting reduction in water absorption is a common and undesirable side effect of existing compositions comprising carbohydrase inhibiting components and/or glucose absorption inhibiting components. The decreased water uptake observed for these compositions often leads to increased excretion of water in the faeces, a cause of diarrhea and other adverse effects. Thus the need for a potent and safe amylase inhibitor and/or glucosidase inhibitor which can suitably be used in compositions which reduce glucose absorption in the intestine is well recognised in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Another drawback of many compositions currently available suitable for the purposes indicated above, is the inclusion therein of components of which no extensive safety data exist, making the use, especially long term use of such products dubious and potentially unsafe. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Surprisingly, it was found that the administration of an effective amount of &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component, whose intestinal absorption is sodium dependent, provides a solution to the above problems. The use of such &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid components fulfils a long standing need for a safe and effective method of inhibiting carbohydrate absorption, without the risks of diarrhoea and dehydration that are associated with the use of existing carbohydrase inhibitors. An example of an &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid that may advantageously be used in accordance with the present invention is citric acid. Citric acid is used in many applications, particularly in the food industry. However, the use of citric acid in a method of inhibiting intestinal carbohydrate absorption is not disclosed in the prior art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention relates to a method of inhibiting intestinal absorption of carbohydrates in mammals, which method comprises orally administering a dietetic preparation to such mammal, said preparation containing &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component, whose intestinal absorption is sodium dependent, in an amount equivalent to at least 1 wt. % citric acid, so as to provide &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component in an amount which is therapeutically effective to achieve inhibition of intestinal absorption of carbohydrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;inhibition&rdquo; should no be interpreted restrictively, i.e. in the context of this application it encompasses prevention as well as suppression (or reduction) of intestinal absorption of carbohydrate, in particular as a result of carbohydrase inhibition. An &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid is a carboxylic acid wherein the &agr;-carbon atom is substituted with a hydroxy group. These acids can be represented by the general formula:

The &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acids employed are most effective if they contain less than 12 carbon atoms, preferably between 3 and 10 carbon atoms, more preferably between 3 and 6 carbon atoms. In addition the total number of hydroxyl groups preferably does not exceed 4. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The term &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component encompasses the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid itself, precursors of said acid and metabolites of the acid which display a similar inhibiting functionality. The term mammals includes all warm blooded vertebrates. Preferably the present method is applied to humans or pets such as dog, cat and rabbit. Whether or not the absorption of a specific &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid is sodium dependent can be determined in an in vitro model of epithelium cells lining the intestinal tract. Such methods are well known in the art and often performed in so called Ussing chambers. Sodium dependency of absorption may also be determined by an in vivo marker perfusion technique as described by Patra et al., &ldquo;Enhanced sodium absorption by citrate: an in vivo perfusion study of rat small intestines&rdquo;, J. Pedriatr Gastoenterol Nurt (1990) 11, 385-388. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The discovery by the current inventors that &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acids whose intestinal absorption is sodium dependent, not only stimulates rehydration, thereby preventing dehydration, but also inhibits intestinal &agr;-amylase, has made it possible to develop a method of inhibiting intestinal carbohydrate absorption which method does not suffer from the adverse side effects normally occurring in known compositions having such action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Glucose is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract in a sodium dependent manner causing hydration of the intestinal cells. In the absence of high concentrations of glucose and other monosaccharides, e.g. as a result of inhibition of intestinal carbohydrase enzymes, the sodium uptake is reduced, resulting in a decreased water absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, potentially followed by adverse side effects such as diarrhoea. The &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component used in the present method is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract in a sodium dependent way, thereby increasing the sodium concentration of the gastrointestinal cells. The increased cellular sodium concentration will increase the intracellular osmotic value, which again will induce intestinal water absorption i.e. rehydration. Thus the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component which is absorbed in a sodium dependent way offers the advantage that it counteracts the reductions of sodium absorption induced by the carbohydrase inhibiting action of the present dietetic preparation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Inhibition of digestive enzymes often results in the excretion of intestinal fluid in the faeces, e.g. in the form of diarrhoea, resulting in a loss of intestinal acidic compounds and intestinal water. The loss of intestinal acidic compounds increases the pH of the intestine, resulting in several adverse side effects, such as cellular damage to the digestive tract and inhibition of conversion of proenzyme pepsinogen to pepsin, which subsequently interferes with protein breakdown. Additionally, a rise of the intestinal pH stimulates the proliferation and growth of pathogenic bacteria in the digestive tract, such as <highlight><italic>Escherichia coli. </italic></highlight>Clostridium species and Bacterioides. Generally, the pathogenic bacteria are known to grow in the intestine when the pH is in the range of 5 or more, whereas the bacteria are inhibited at a pH in the range of 3.6 or below. Oral administration of &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component whose absorption is sodium dependent will minimise dehydration and will thus prevent or suppress the proliferation of intestinal pathogenic bacteria caused by the inhibition of intestinal carbohydrase enzymes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors believe that the present &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component stimulates rehydration through the intestinal co-transport of the acid and sodium. It has been shown that, for instance, citrate uptake by brush border membranes occurs by a Na(&plus;)-dependent transport mechanism (Wolffram et al., &ldquo;Transport of tri- and dicarboxylic acids across the intestinal brush border membrane of calves&rdquo;, J. Nutr, (1990), 120(7), 767-774). Furthermore, in humans, citrate has been shown to stimulate absorption of sodium and consequently water absorption from the human jejunum (Rolston et al, &ldquo;Acetate and citrate stimulate water and sodium absorption in the human jejunum&rdquo;, Digestion, (1986), 34(2), 101-104). The sodium co-transported with the citrate is believed to induce an increase of intracellular osmotic value, resulting in water transport from the intestine to the cells, i.e. rehydration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present method produces particularly good results if the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component is provided in a daily amount equivalent to at least 0.25 mg, preferably at least 0.5 mg citric acid per kg of bodyweight of the mammal. Most preferably the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component is provided in a daily amount equivalent to at least 1 mg, more preferably equivalent to at least 3 mg citric acid per kg of bodyweight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The amount of &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component which is equivalent to a given amount of citric acid can be established as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> 1. calculate the equivalent molar amount of citric acid, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> 2. multiply the molar amount by a factor 3 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> 3. divide the result of the multiplication by the number of carboxylic groups present in the &agr;-hydroxy carboxyl acid </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> 4. calculate for the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component how many mg&apos;s are equivalent to the molar amount obtained from 3. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the method of the invention, preferably the dosage form is chosen such that preparation can be administered in dosage units of between 0.025 and 200 g, more preferably between 0.1 and 100 g, and most preferably between 0.25 and 50 g. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> For a human being, a single dosage unit preferably comprises &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component in an amount equivalent to at least 40 mg, more preferably at least 100 mg, most preferably above 250 mg citric acid. Meals, such as breakfast, lunch, and dinner usually contain digestible carbohydrates in amounts of 20 grams or more. According to a preferred embodiment, the dietetic preparation used in the method according to the invention is directed towards the inhibition of the absorption the digestible carbohydrates from meals. In order to obtain sufficient inhibition of carbohydrate absorption following the consumption of such a meal, the preparation preferably contains &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component in an amount equivalent to at least 150 mg, more preferably at least 200 mg citric acid. To ensure a sufficient rehydration when additional carbohydrase inhibitors or monosaccharide uptake inhibitors are present in the dietetic preparation used in the method according to the invention, the dietetic preparation preferably contains at least &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component in an amount equivalent to at least 100 mg, more preferably at least 150 mg, most preferably at least 200 mg citric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> If the present dietetic preparation is used to reduce the absorption of carbohydrates originating from a separately consumed foodstuff (hereinafter referred to as dietary carbohydrates), it is desirable for said preparation to contain large amounts of digestible carbohydrates as this will counteract the objective of achieving inhibition of carbohydrate absorption. Hence, in a preferred embodiment, the dietetic preparation comprises less than 60 wt. %, more preferably less than 40 wt. %, even more preferably less than 25 wt. % and especially preferred, less than 10 wt. % digestible carbohydrates calculated on dry weight of the preparation. Unless indicated otherwise, the percentages mentioned in this application apply to the consumable part of the preparation, e.g. not including packaging material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred embodiment the caloric value of digestible carbohydrates is less than 50%, preferably less than 25% and more preferably less than 10% of the total caloric value of the preparation according to the invention. In yet another preferred embodiment the amount of &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic component, calculated as citric acid equivalent, exceeds the amount of digestible carbohydrates in the preparation. More preferably the amount of &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic component, calculated as citric acid equivalent, is at least twice, preferably at least thrice as high as the amount of digestible carbohydrates in the preparation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Transport of glucose in a cell is accompanied by transport of Na<highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight> and water absorption. Inhibition of glucose absorption will normally lead to reduced water absorption which again may give rise to diarrhoea. Although an &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic component such as citric acid will stimulate water transport, i.e. rehydration, it is undesirable for the present preparation to contain large amounts of water as this will increase the risk of diarrhoea and other adverse side effects. Hence, in a preferred embodiment, the dietetic preparation used in the method of the invention contains less than 95 wt. %, preferably less than 90 wt. %, even more preferably less than 75 wt. % and most preferably less than 25 wt. % water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In order for the present preparation to be effective in inhibiting carbohydrate absorption said preparation should deliver citric acid into the intestine in a rather concentrated form, i.e. at least 1% by weight of the preparation. Preferably the dietetic preparation used in the present method contains &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component in an amount equivalent to at least 2 wt. %, more preferably at least 5 wt. % and most preferably at least 8 wt. % citric acid. Generally the preparation will contain the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component in an amount which is equivalent to less than 95 wt. % citric acid, preferably less than 90 wt. % citric acid and more preferably less than 75 wt. % citric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> According to a very preferred embodiment of the invention the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component is citric acid component. The term &ldquo;citric acid component&rdquo; as used herein, encompasses citric acid, precursors of citric acid and metabolites of citric acid which display a similar inhibiting functionality. In case the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component is citric acid component the amount of citric acid component which is equivalent to a given amount of citric acid is easily established by calculating which amount of the citric acid component would liberate said given amount of citric acid, assuming that the citric acid component is fully converted, i.e., releases all citric acid contained therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Citric acid (2-Hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid) is a naturally occurring fruit acid, produced commercially by microbial fermentation of a carbohydrate substrate is widely available, e.g. as monohydrate or anhydrous citric acid and is the most widely used organic acidulant and pH-control agent in foods, beverages, pharmaceuticals and technical applications. However, it has not been recognised before to have the advantageous capability of inhibiting carbohydrate absorption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In Europe, citric acid monohydrate and anhydrous are listed as generally permitted food additives (E 330) and may be added to all foodstuffs. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) affirmed citric acid as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) and permitted the use in food according to current GMP (CFR &sect;182.1033), without setting an upper limit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The dietetic preparation in accordance with the invention may suitably take the form of tablets, capsules, powders, foodstuffs (e.g. nutritional bars or desserts). According to a preferred embodiment of this invention, the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component is ingested in the form of a tablet or capsule, having a weight between about 25 mg and 3000 mg, preferably between about 100 mg and 2500 mg, most preferably between 200 and 2000 mg. In order to prevent adverse taste effects, particularly in case the acid component is administered in a concentrated way in the form of a capsule or a tablet, said tablet or capsule is preferably coated in such a way that the acid component is not released in the mouth. Effectiveness of the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component is further enhanced when the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid is specifically delivered in the small intestine, e.g. by incorporating the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component in a tablet or capsule having a stomach acid resistant coating, e.g. coated with an acid resistant polymer, or alternatively by employing an &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid precursor which releases most of the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid in the small intestine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present method the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid is delivered in the intestine in a largely protonated form. Thus, preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 75% of the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid in the present preparation is protonated. In case the acid contains more than one carboxylic group these percentages are to be applied to the total number of carboxylic groups. In order to ensure that the carboxylic acids remain protonated even when entering the mildly acidic intestinal tract, it may be advantageous to include an acidic buffer with a buffer pH at which the acid is largely protonated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Best results are obtained with the present method if the preparation is administered no more than 60, preferably no more than 30 minutes before or after consumption of a foodstuff containing a significant amount, e.g. at least 20 g, of digestible carbohydrates, Thus the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid is allowed to move through the intestine together with the foodstuff, thereby effectively preventing enzymatic digestion of the saccharides contained therein, and simultaneously preventing dehydration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The term digestible carbohydrates as used herein includes carbohydrates which can be absorbed directly by the intestine of the mammal as well as carbohydrates which are readily degraded within the intestine to such directly absorbable carbohydrates. Carbohydrates that are readily degraded within the intestine are those carbohydrates that can be digested by one or more of the salivatory, pancreatic or brush border enzymes of a given mammal. In case of humans these enzymes include glucoamylase (glucosidase), isomaltase, &agr;-limit dextrinase, sucrase, lactase, pancreatic amylase and/or salivatory amylase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The present method aims to inhibit intestinal carbohydrate absorption. Inhibition of intestinal carbohydrate absorption within the context of this invention refers specifically to a decrease of the intestinal enzyme activity that is associated with the hydrolysis of di-, tri-, oligo- and polysaccharides. Thus the present method leads to a decreased net absorption of monosaccharides from dietary digestible carbohydrates or to an absorption of monosaccharides over an increased surface area of the small intestine (i.e. absorption spread out over a longer period of time). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The present method is particularly suitable for (prophylactically) treating obesity as the reduction in carbohydrate absorption will usually also lead to a reduction in production of body fat. Another advantageous application of the method is its use for suppressing fluctuations in blood glucose levels, which is particularly beneficial for diabetics. Suppression of blood glucose fluctuations, and particularly the blood glucose &lsquo;peaks&rsquo;, is also of benefit for obese people as the resulting gradual absorption of carbohydrates usually leads to less body fat formation than is observed for rapid absorption of the same amount of carbohydrates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The dietetic preparation according to the invention preferably contains &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component in an amount equivalent to at least 25 mg, more preferably equivalent to between 50 and 3000 mg, and most preferably equivalent to between 200 and 2000 mg citric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The citric acid component used in accordance with the invention is preferably selected from the group consisting of citric acid, precursors of citric acid capable of liberating citric acid under the influence of the conditions prevailing in the gastrointestinal tract and mixtures thereof. More preferably the citric acid component is selected from the group consisting of citric acid, citric acid salts, citric acid esters and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The dietetic preparation of the present invention is preferably packaged as an oral dosage unit containing between 0.025 and 200 g, more preferably between 0.1 and 100 g and most preferably between 0.3 and 10 g of the preparation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In another preferred embodiment the dietetic preparation contains at least 10 wt. % &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component, less than 50 wt. % water and less than 10 wt. % digestible carbohydrates. Both the presence of large amounts of water and digestible carbohydrates are undesirable as they counteract the efficacy of the present method and preparation. In an even more preferred embodiment the preparation contains less than 10 wt. % water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Preferably the present preparation is designed in such a way that it will deliver &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component in a concentrated form so it may easily be ingested concurrently with the consumption of a foodstuff. Hence the present preparation is advantageously packaged as an oral dosage unit containing between 0.1 and 5 g of the preparation and containing the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component in an amount equivalent to between 100 and 2500 mg, preferably between 200 and 2000 mg citric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the invention relates to a dietetic preparation in the form of an oral dosage unit of between 0.1 and 100 grams, said preparation containing between 2 and 90 wt. % of &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component, whose intestinal absorption is sodium dependent, between 1 and 80 wt. % of a carbohydrate absorption inhibitor selected from the group consisting of polyphenols, gymnemic acid and mixtures thereof and between 97 said 9 wt. % of pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Preferably the present preparation contains between 10 and 50 wt. % of the carbohydrate absorption inhibitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> More preferably the present preparation contains between 10 and 80 wt. % of plant polyphenols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Tablets and equivalent solid and semi-solid oral dosage forms can suitably contain excipients such as hydroxypropylmethyl_cellulose, other cellulosic materials, starch, polyvinyl-pyrrolidine, lactose and other sugars, starch, dicalcium phosphate, starch polymers, stearates, talc etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment of the present invention relates to a kit containing at least 10 dosage units comprising a dietetic preparation according to the invention, wherein the weight of the individual dosage units is between 0.3 and 10 g and said dosage units contain the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component in an amount equivalent to between 100 and 2500 mg citric acid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Carbohydrase Inhibitors </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The dietetic preparation used in the present method may advantageously comprise one or more known carbohydrase enzyme inhibitors, since these inhibitors may complement the desirable effect of the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component. In a preferred embodiment of this invention the dietetic preparation for inhibition of intestinal carbohydrate absorption further comprises a second carbohydrase inhibitor, preferably an intestinal &agr;-glucosidase inhibitor, in an amount effective to provide synergistic action besides the &agr;-amylase inhibition by the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid. Examplary and preferred carbohydrase inhibitors used accordance with the present invention include phaseolamin, roselle tea, lotus, arabinose, inosine, adenosine, evening primrose extract, banaba extract, indigestible dextrin and polyphenols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The combination of &agr;-amylase inhibitors and &agr;-glucosidase inhibitors provide a potent blend of carbohydrase inhibitor. Such combinations are known in the art, however these combinations exhibit pronounced side effects, particularly when compared to a single carbohydrase inhibitors. These side effects include severe diarrhea, dehydration, flatulence and loss of intestinal fluids (see above). Such adverse side effects are observed to a much lower degree when the present method is employed, i.e. using a preparation containing an effective amount of &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The supplementary intestinal carbohydrase inhibitor, preferably &agr;-glucosidase inhibitor, to be used in combination with citric acid is preferably derived from plant material, preferably herbal plant material. The plant derived material used preferably comprises polyphenols. More preferably the plant derived material is an extract of a plant material in which the content of polyphenols is increased compared to the content of polyphenols naturally occurring in stems, leafs, roots and/or seeds of the same plant material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Polyphenols </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the current invention, the carbohydrase inhibitor, preferably &agr;-glucosidase inhibitor, are plant derived polyphenols, selected form the group of catechins or derivatives thereof, anthocyanidins, proanthocyanidins, procyanidin and cyandin, which are exemplary and preferably obtained green tea (<highlight><italic>Camellia sinensis</italic></highlight>) or grape (<highlight><italic>Vitis vinifera</italic></highlight>). Preferably such plant extracts have significant content of polyphenols, increasing the effectiveness as an intestinal carbohydrase inhibitor. However, oral intake of polyphenols, especially extracts will result in a decreased absorption of water in the intestine, resulting in many cases in diarrhea and loss of intestinal fluid, potentially followed by proliferation and growth of undesirable intestinal bacteria and damage to the intestinal cells. Such adverse side effects of polyphenol ingestion, especially compositions having high polyphenol content, will be prevented by the co-administration of &agr;-hydroxy carboxylicacid component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Herbal extracts comprising polyphenols are known in the art. Most suitable for use in the method and preparation according to the present invention, are extracts comprising more than about 10 wt. % polyphenols based on the dry weight of the plant extract, preferably above about 25 wt. % polyphenols even more preferably above about 50 wt. % polyphenols and most preferably above abut 75 wt. % polyphenols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Green Tea Extract </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The dietetic preparation of the present invention may advantageously contain green tea extract as a source of polyphenols. Green tea catechins or derivatives thereof (including monomers, polymers or gallated monomers or polymers of catechin) have been described to inhibit the intestinal &agr;-glucosidase enzyme (Matsui et al, 1996). Additionally green tea has been ingested for centuries by human beings and can therefore be regarded as very safe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Preferably green tea extracts used in the preparation according to the invention comprise more than 20 wt. %, more preferably more than 40 wt. % catechins expressed as epigallocatechin gallate based on the total dry weight of the green tea extract, so as to provide sufficient carbohydrase inhibitory action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Grapeseed Extract </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> To further stimulate the action of &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid or the combination of such acid and polyphenols (e.g. green tea polyphenols), grape polyphenols can be added to the formulation. Grape polyphenols are preferably obtained from the seeds. Suitable for use in the composition according to the invention is grape seed powder, however, according to a preferred embodiment grape seed (powder) extract is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Grape seed powder or extract preferably comprises an effective amount of grape polyphenols, preferably one or more selected from anthocyanidins, proanthocyanidins, procyanidin and cyanidin. The grapeseed powder or extract preferably comprises more than about 10 wt. % grape polyphenols based on the dry weight of the grape seed powder or extract, preferably more than about 25 wt. % polyphenols, even more preferably more than about 50 wt. % polyphenols, most preferred above about 75 wt. % polyphenols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Monosaccharide Absorption Inhibitor </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the preparation according to the present invention comprises a component capable of inhibiting monosaccharide uptake in the intestine. Such a component, when used alone, can also produce the adverse side effects mentioned above, i.e. diarrhea, flatulence etc. When used in combination with &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component such undesirable effects will be reduced or prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The action of the monosaccharide uptake inhibitor will further enhance the effects of inhibition of the carbohydrate absorption and/or increase the intestine surface area across which the carbohydrate is absorbed. Thus the co-administration of a monosaccharide uptake inhibitor will increase the performance of the present preparation. The inhibition of uptake of monosaccharides by the monosaccharide uptake inhibitor, increases the monosaccharide/digestible carbohydrate ratio, thereby decreasing the conversion rate of digestible carbohydrates to monosaccharides and thus providing the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid and other carbohydrase inhibitors the opportunity to further inhibit the carbohydrase activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The substances capable of inhibiting monosaccharide uptake used in a preferred embodiment according to this invention are capable of decreasing transport of monosaccharide over the intestinal wall without the necessity for a decrease in intestinal glucose concentration. However, excess content of monosaccharide uptake inhibitor in the dietetic preparation according to the invention might interfere with the rehydration action of the &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component. Monosaccharide uptake inhibitors which may advantageously be employed in the present method include fibrous and non-fibrous monosaccharide uptake inhibitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In case non-fibrous monosaccharide uptake inhibitors are employed, the weight ratio monosaccharide inhibitor to &agr;-hydroxy carboxylic acid component is between about 10:1 and 1:250, more preferably between 1:1 and 1:100, and most preferably between 1:5 and 1:50. Preferably the non-fibrous monosaccharide uptake inhibitor is of plant origin Preferably such a substance is of a plant origin, of which the safety has been well established. Exemplary non-fibrous monosaccharide uptake inhibitors are peppermint (oil), procyanidin, galloyl residues or can be obtained from Gymnema species, Azadirachta indica, Eugenia uniflore, Ginseng radix, soy. An especially preferred compound for such action to be used in the preparation according to the invention is gymnemic acid. This substance can, for example, be found in plants of the species Gymnema, e,g, <highlight><italic>Gymnema sylvestre. </italic></highlight>According to a further preferred embodiment the composition comprises at least 5 wt. %, more preferably at least 10 wt. % and most preferably at least 20 wt. % gymnemic acid calculated on dry weight of the monosaccharide uptake inhibitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention the dietetic preparation comprises a fibrous monosaccharide uptake inhibitor, such as indigestible plant carbohydrates, particularly plant fibres. Preferably the fibrous monosaccharide uptake inhibitor comprises an effective amount of soluble fibres selected from the group consisting of pectin, guar gum, Konjak mannan, locust bean gum, oat fibre, inulin and mixtures hereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Use </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The preparation according to the invention can be used advantageously by subjects having the desire or need to reduce carbohydrate absorption, or desiring to decrease fluctuations in blood glucose level. The preparation may be used as such in weight management programs or can be included in compositions designed for weight management, for athletes having the desire to decrease carbohydrate absorption and for preventing the adverse side effects of craving, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Compositions that aim to meet the above objectives are known in the art and are often referred to as &ldquo;carbohydrate cutters&rdquo;, &ldquo;carb-cutters&rdquo;, &ldquo;carbohydrate blockers&rdquo;, &ldquo;carb blockers&rdquo;, compositions providing balanced and/or healthy blood sugar levels, protein bars and the like. </paragraph>
