<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to telecommunications equipment and, in particular, to a network interface device (&ldquo;NID&rdquo;), and high speed delivery method, used to provide both traditional residential service (i.e., POTS service) and high speed digital service to a customer. Specifically, the present invention is comprised of a network interface unit (&ldquo;NIU&rdquo;) module, with an associated removable customer access module, which can be mounted in the existing slot cavities of an existing NID to terminate DSL or T1 service, or &ldquo;pass-thru&rdquo; T1 service. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Digital Subscriber Line (&ldquo;DSL&rdquo;) is a standardized technology which offers significant improvements in high-speed digital service over existing copper facilities. These improvements provide an increase in the speed of the digital services, decrease in cable pair utilization, increase in noise immunity, and a decrease in service installation time. DSL is represented by a number of variations (generally designated by the acronym &ldquo;xDSL&rdquo;) to accommodate specific applications. Each DSL variant is unique with respect to performance, applications and cable pair utilization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Integrated Services Digital Network (&ldquo;ISDN&rdquo;) and Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (&ldquo;ADSL&rdquo;) are DSL technology generally used as a high-speed digital transmission transport for residential service. For residential service, a NID is installed on or near the customer&apos;s house to establish a demarcation point. The demarcation point establishes the telephone service responsibility between the Network Service Provider and the customer. The NID passes-thru the ISDN and ADSL service to the customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are two methods for delivering high-speed services, namely, termination and pass-thru. High speed services involving DSL technology are typically terminated within the NID, while T1 technology can be either terminated or passed-thru. Terminating high speed services involves the conversion of the DSL or T1 technology into a digital signal format in the transmission path. This digital signal format is then converted into another technology to interface the customer&apos;s equipment. Pass-thru high speed service does not perform DSL or T1 technology conversion in the transmission path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The NID is a plastic mechanical enclosure designed for outdoor environments for the purpose of terminating the Network Service Provider&apos;s copper facilities and allowing the customer access to those facilities (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> (prior art)). The NID <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has two compartments, a customer compartment <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a network access compartment <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Each compartment is accessed through a series of hinged doors <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, whereas the customer can only access their compartment, and the Network Service Provider can access both compartments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The NID is typically designed to terminate the Network Service Provider&apos;s copper facilities and provide a plurality of two-wire telephone services (i.e., POTS services) to the customer. Thus, the network access compartment has a plurality of single slot cavities <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> for receiving components to provide such telephone services. One or more of the cavities in the network access compartment receives a transient protection device <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> that protects the NID. The transient protection device has screw terminals that interface to the Network Service Provider&apos;s copper facilities. One or more of the corresponding cavities in the customer access compartment receives a removable customer access module <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> having wires for connecting to the transient protector, and an interface, typically a RJ11 modular jack, for connecting the customer&apos;s telephone or other communication equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other components which can be used in these cavities include an ADSL Splitter, an Analog Line Conditioner, or a Test Circuitry. Each of these components are described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An ADSL Splitter is a device that separates ADSL technology from analog voice carried on telephone wire. The ADSL Splitter does not terminate DSL services, but instead separates the POTS and ADSL service from the copper facilities. The ADSL Splitter passes-thru the ADSL service to the customer&apos;s equipment for ADSL service termination. The ADSL Splitter is mainly comprised of passive circuitry and therefore contains a minimal amount of electronic circuitry. The ADSL Splitter is used in conjunction with the existing removable customer access module. Such a device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,026,160, issued to Staber et al. on Feb. 15, 2000, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An Analog Line Conditioner is a device that equalizes and conditions the analog voice signal to increase the performance of analog modems (e.g. V.32 type modems). The Analog Line Conditioner does not terminate DSL services. The Analog Line Conditioner equalizes and conditions the analog voice signal and then passes-thru the optimized analog voice signal to the customer. The Analog Line Conditioner is a device that is comprised of active and passive circuitry. The Analog Line Conditioner is used in conjunction with the existing removable customer access module. As with the ADSL Splitter, the Analog Line Conditioner is used in conjunction with ADSL service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Test Circuitry or Over-Voltage Protection components are simply modified removable customer access modules which integrate the test circuitry or over-voltage protection by placing the circuitry underneath the RJ11 and terminal screws of the removable customer access module. This circuitry does not assist or provide functionality for the termination or pass-thru of signals. Test circuitry provides the Network Service Provider the ability to test the copper facilities. Over-voltage protection provides the protection of the copper facilities from the customer. Such a device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,011,831, issued to Nieves et al. on Jan. 4, 2000, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,367,569 issued to Roach et al. on Nov. 22, 1994, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Other DSL variants such as High-Speed Digital Subscriber Line using two wire pairs (&ldquo;HDSL&rdquo;), High-Speed Digital Subscriber Line2 (&ldquo;HDSL2&rdquo;), High-Speed Digital Subscriber Line2 using two wire pairs (&ldquo;HDSL4&rdquo;) (generally &ldquo;HDSLx&rdquo;), ISDN Digital Subscriber Line (&ldquo;IDSL&rdquo;), Symmetric High-Speed Digital Subscriber Line (&ldquo;G.shdsl&rdquo;), and Very High-Speed Digital Subvscriber Line (&ldquo;VDSL&rdquo;), as well as T1 service, are used for high speed digital service. T1 service is a legacy technology which provides high-speed symmetrical digital transmission over two wire pairs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For high-speed digital service, a NIU is typically installed at the customer&apos;s facility to establish the demarcation point and to provide the Network Service Provider maintenance and testing capabilities on the high speed service. The NIU is a printed circuit board that is populated with various electronic components to provide the test and maintenance capabilities, as well as DSL or T1 termination, or T1 pass-thru. The NIU is installed in a mechanical mounting which provides the necessary connectors to interface and terminate the Network Service Provider&apos;s copper facilities and allow customer access to the high-speed digitial service being carried by those facilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> To provide high speed service along with traditional residential service (i.e., POTS service) to the customer, both an NID and an NIU are used. There have been three known approaches to accomplish the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The first known approach involves the installation of a traditional NIU (i.e., plug-in card mechanics) a short distance away from the NID, approximately one hundred to two hundred feet. In this approach, the NIU is typically installed within the customer&apos;s residence. There are numerous disadvantages to this approach. The material cost involved with this approach includes the cost of the NIU and the NIU mechanical mounting. The installation requires a technician to install the NIU mounting at the customer&apos;s facility, requiring coordination and scheduling, which often is a very time consuming and iterative process. Further, the installation requires the technician to locate an appropriate place to install the NIU mounting and then route wire from the NID to the NIU. Additionally, the installation of the NIU mounting at the customer facility extends the demarcation point. The Network Service Provider would then be responsible for service to the NIU. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The second approach to providing both residential service and high speed service to a customer is to replace the existing NID cover or lid with another cover or lid that supports an encapsulated, traditional NIU. This replacement lid is designed with an extended cavity to support the encapsulated NIU and associated mechanical support brackets. The replacement lid is visually similar to the existing NID cover with the exception of an increase in depth, with the encapsulated NIU filling substantially the entire increased area inside the replacement lid. There are numerous disadvantages to this approach as well. The material cost involved with this approach includes the cost of the replacement NID cover and an encapsulated NIU. The installation requires a technician to remove the existing NID cover and replace it with the integrated NID cover. Since an NID base and cover is designed to provide a hermetic seal upon closure and under an outdoor weather environment, the removal of the NID cover may damage the hermetic seal with the existing NID base, e.g., by potential damage to the existing NID&apos;s hinges and lid-to-base fitting. Additionally, the removal of the NID cover can be difficult, as proper tools and often significant physical force are required. Further, wiring of the encapsulated NIU in the replacement lid to the existing NID base is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The third approach is to replace the entire NID with another NID that is designed to support a traditional NIU. This new NID is functionally similar to the replacement NID cover, except that this new NID includes a cavity in the cover that supports an NIU and associated mechanical brackets. As before, there are numerous disadvantages to this approach. The material cost involved with this approach includes the cost of the new NID and the NIU. The installation requires a technician to remove the entire NID and replace it with the new NID that accommodates an NIU. The removal of the entire NID would involve significant time and effort as well as customer phone service interruption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention, however, overcomes the problems and disadvantages of these prior art approaches to providing both traditional residential and high speed digital service to a customer. The present invention provides for an improved, cost-effective, time saving, and user friendly method and device for delivering high speed digital services in an existing NID without the need to modify the NID in any manner. </paragraph>
