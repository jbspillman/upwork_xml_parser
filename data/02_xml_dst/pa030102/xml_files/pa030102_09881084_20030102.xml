<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an apparatus and method capable of testing a transducer and, in one aspect, an apparatus and method capable of determining an amount of error in an outputted signal from a displacement transducer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, a displacement transducer senses a change in a position of a body or a point with respect to a reference point. Linear displacement transducers sense a change in a position of a body or point along a line or axis with respect to a reference point. While different varieties of linear displacement transducers use various techniques to sense a change in position, most have a movable, extendable portion that contacts or is attached to the body to be measured. The extendable portion can be a rod that extends from a transducer body, such as in a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) or a magnetostrictive displacement transducer. The extendable portion can also be a wire or a cable, such as in a draw-wire transducer with displacements ranging from 0 to 25 meters or more. As the measured body or point changes position, the extendable portion of the transducer changes position, and the transducer outputs a signal corresponding to the degree of change in position. For example, if a displacement transducer has a range of 2500 mm and a designed voltage output of 0-10 volts over its range, a displacement of 250 mm should result in a voltage output of one volt. It follows that a displacement of 500 mm should result in a voltage output of two volts, and so forth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is advantageous if the output signal, with respect to the displacement, can be described by a curve. It is even more advantageous if the output signal, with respect to the displacement, has a linear relationship. That is, for a constant change in displacement, there is a constant change in the signal outputted from the transducer. While this is a desirable condition, some degree of error exists. For example, for a displacement of 100 mm, the corresponding signal output might be 1.012 volts; for a displacement of 200 mm, the corresponding signal output might be 2.037 volts. Thus, the outputs of transducers have associated tolerances. For example, a transducer having a displacement range of 1000 mm and a displacement tolerance of &plus;/&minus;0.1% of full scale is capable of determining a displacement within 1.0 mm. That is, in this example, the transducer does not have the ability to discern changes in displacement that are less than 1.0 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is important that a displacement transducer is capable of operating within the tolerances specified for it. Using a displacement transducer that is incapable of operating within the tolerances specified for it in an application which requires such tolerances can bring on undesirable results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to overcoming, or at least reducing the effects of, one or more of the problems set forth above. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In one aspect of the present invention, an apparatus is provided that is capable of testing a displacement transducer having an extendable portion. The apparatus includes a slide that is capable of being moved along an axis. The extendable portion of the displacement transducer is connectible to the slide so that, when the extendable portion is connected to the slide and the slide is moved, the extendable portion is extended and retracted along a path. In applications wherein the extendable portion of the transducer is longer than the slide, a displacement transducer of any length can be measured by clamping and unclamping the extendable portion and the reciprocating the slide. The apparatus also includes measuring means for determining a displacement of the slide along the axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention, a method capable of testing a displacement transducer is provided including determining a plurality of electrical signal values outputted from the transducer corresponding to a plurality of displacements of the transducer and creating a statistical model based upon the plurality of electrical signal values and the plurality of the displacements of the displacement transducer. Further, the method includes determining a displacement error of the displacement transducer for each of the plurality of electrical signal values and the plurality of displacements of displacement transducer based upon the statistical model. Each of the displacement errors is examined to determine which exceed a predetermined tolerance. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developer&apos;s specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort, even if complex and time-consuming, would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> illustrate one embodiment of an apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> capable of testing a displacement transducer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> having an extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. The apparatus includes a slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> that is capable of being moved along an axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and a measurement unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that is capable of determining a displacement of the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> along the axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The measurement unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be, for example, a resolver, an encoder, a laser interferometer, or any other measuring device known to the art that is suitable for measuring the displacement of the slide. In the illustrated embodiment, the measurement unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a laser head <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> that is capable of projecting a light beam and receiving a reflected light beam. While these two beams propagate along separate paths that are substantially parallel and proximate to one another, representations of the beams are shown as a single broken line <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The measurement unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment further includes a retroreflector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that is fixed (e.g., attached with screws) to the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The retroreflector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is capable of receiving the light beam projected from the laser head <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and is capable of producing a reflected light beam that can be received by the laser head <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The term &ldquo;substantially parallel&rdquo; means that no statistically significant measurement error exists resulting from a lack of parallelism between the elements being described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, at least a portion of the light beam projected from the laser head <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and at least a portion of the light beam projected through the interferometer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and reflected by the retroreflector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> propagate along paths that are substantially parallel to the axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In this situation, no statistically significant measurement error exists that results from a lack of parallelism between the portion of the light beam and the axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In a situation wherein the laser head <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is positioned so that the light projected therefrom, propagating through the interferometer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, falls directly onto the retroreflector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, the light beam projected from the laser head <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the light beam reflected by the retroreflector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> each propagate along paths that are substantially parallel to the axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. However, in a situation where it is not advantageous to set up the laser head <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> so that the light projected therefrom, propagating through the interferometer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, falls directly onto the retroreflector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, the measurement unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> further includes a retroreflector <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>, attached to the interferometer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, so that the light beam projected from the laser head <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> passes through the interferometer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (by being reflected by the retroreflector <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>) before being received by the retroreflector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and the light beam reflected by the retroreflector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> passes through the interferometer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> (by being reflected by the retroreflector <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>) before being received by the laser head <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Thus, in this embodiment, light beams propagating through the interferometer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> are turned at a right angle by a combination of the interferometer <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the retroreflector <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, the extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is connectible to the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and, in one embodiment, the extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is connectible to the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> via a wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, wherein the wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is connected to the extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and is attached to the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> being &ldquo;connectible to&rdquo; the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> encompasses either the extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> being connectible to the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> or the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> being connectible to the extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is attached to the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by a clamp <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> extends along a path that is substantially parallel to the axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and is extendable and retractable along that path. One embodiment of the present invention further comprises a reel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> that is capable of taking-up and paying-out the wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and is capable of maintaining a tension on the wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. For example, the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is moved to a reference position, the wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is clamped to the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is then moved according to a particular desired displacement of the extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can be moved by rotating the reel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and thus taking-up or paying-out the wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or by moving the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by hand; however, any suitable way known in the art for moving the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is within the scope of the present invention. After making a measurement, the wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is then unclamped with the reel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> keeping a tension on the wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> so that the extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> remains at the same displacement. The slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is then moved back to the reference position and the wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> reclamped to the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. This process is repeated until the desired displacement of the displacement transducer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has been tested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the present invention includes an alignment pulley <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> that is capable of aligning the wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> along a path that is substantially parallel to the axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the alignment pulley <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is disposed between the displacement transducer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the reel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is advantageous for the wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the movement of the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and the light beams of the measurement unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to be aligned along paths that are parallel to the axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, since such an arrangement simplifies the calculation of displacement values for the transducer. That is, if these elements are arranged as described, a displacement of the extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> equal to 100 mm, effected by a movement of the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, can be directly measured by the measurement unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as 100 mm. If these elements are not arranged as described, trigonometric calculations must be made to compensate for cosine errors resulting from elements operating off-axis. For example, if the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> moves along an axis that is skewed from the axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> while the light beams of the measurement unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are parallel with the axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, a displacement of the extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, resulting from a movement of the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, might actually be equal to 98 mm, but the measurement unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> might measure the displacement as being 100 mm. Thus, a cosine error correction can be calculated: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>E&equals;D</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>meas</subscript></highlight>&minus;(<highlight><italic>D</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>meas </subscript></highlight>cos&thgr;) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> wherein: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> E&equals;cosine error; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> D<highlight><subscript>meas</subscript></highlight>&equals;the measured displacement; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> &thgr;&equals;the angle between the misaligned axes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Thus, in this example, a misalignment angle of 11.5&deg; results in an error of 2 mm, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>E&equals;D</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>meas</subscript></highlight>&minus;(<highlight><italic>D</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>meas </subscript></highlight>cos&thgr;) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>E&equals;</italic></highlight>98 <highlight><italic>mm</italic></highlight>&minus;(98 <highlight><italic>mm</italic></highlight>&middot;cos(11.5<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight>)) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>E&equals;2 mm </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The correction to the measured displacement can be made manually by subtracting, in this case, 2 mm from the measured displacement. Further, the error calculation can be used in an error correction unit that automatically corrects for cosine errors in each displacement measurement. For example, the correction can be made to the measured output of the displacement transducer, the measured displacement, or the displacement error. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In certain applications, it may be desirable to be able to move the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> a small, precise distance along the axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, one embodiment of the present invention provides an adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> that is capable of moving the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> an incremental amount along the axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, either in conjunction with the reel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> or without the reel <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> comprises a block <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and a threaded portion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> threadably engaged with the block <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. On one end of the threaded portion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is a thumbwheel <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> for assisting in turning the threaded portion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. On the other end of the threaded portion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is a pad <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. When the thumbwheel <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> is turned in one direction (clockwise, for example), the threaded portion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> advances through the block <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and, when the pad <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> contacts the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is moved. When the thumbwheel <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> is turned in the other direction (counterclockwise, for example), the threaded portion <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> retracts through the block <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> such that the pad <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> moves away from the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> allows fine adjustments to be made to the movement of the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> along the axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> so that a precise displacement of the extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The illustrated embodiment includes a resolving unit <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> that is capable of resolving an electrical output of the displacement transducer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> corresponding to a displacement of the extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The resolving unit <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> may be any suitable resolving unit known to the art for this purpose. The displacement transducer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> outputs an electrical signal based upon an excitation voltage applied to the displacement transducer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> by the voltage supply <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the displacement of the extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The resolving unit <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> may be a voltmeter, a digital multimeter, a computer system, or any other device suitable for resolving the electrical output of the displacement transducer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Further, the illustrated embodiment of the present invention includes a stop block <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> that is capable of preventing the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> from moving along the axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> beyond the reference point described above. Thus, the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> can be easily returned to the reference point without having to make careful measurements of the location of the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> along the axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. However, the invention is not so limited and the stop block <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> may be omitted in alternative embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A data analysis unit <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is included in the illustrated embodiment to determine a displacement error of the displacement transducer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In one implementation, the data analysis unit <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> performs a method in accordance with the current invention to determine a displacement error of the displacement transducer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The method is discussed further relative to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The error can be determined according to a statistical model, for example, a best-fitting curve model, a least square curve model, a least square linear model, or a least square linear regression model. While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> illustrate the data analysis unit <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> being directly connected with the displacement transducer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, it can be connected with the resolving unit <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> in alternative implementations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The illustrated embodiment further includes a base <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> having at least one linear guide rail <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. While the discussion herein presents one linear guide rail <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, there may be any number of linear guide rails <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> included in the present invention as may be determined suitable. The slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is mounted to the linear guide rail <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and is capable of reciprocating on the linear guide rail <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> so that, when the extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is connect to the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is moved, the extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is extended and retracted along a path substantially parallel to the linear guide rail <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The measurement unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, is capable of determining a displacement of the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> along the linear guide rail <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, at least a portion of the light beam emitted by the laser head <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and at least a portion of the reflected light beam (reflected by the retroreflector <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>) propagate along paths that are substantially parallel to the linear guide rail <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment of the present invention, the wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> extends along a path that is substantially parallel to the linear guide rail <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. One embodiment further includes an alignment pulley <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> that is capable of aligning the wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> along a path that is substantially parallel to the linear guide rail <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. An adjustment mechanism <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is provided in one embodiment to move the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> an incremental amount along the linear guide rail <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The apparatus of the present invention further includes, in one embodiment, a stand capable of holding the displacement transducer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In a further embodiment, the stand is mounted to the linear guide rail <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. A stop block <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> can be provided to prevent the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> from being moved along the linear guide rail <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> beyond a reference point and the stop block <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> can be mounted to the linear guide rail <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. A post can be provided on which to mount the right-angle reflector <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and the post can be mounted to the linear guide rail <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As can be seen from the various embodiments presented, it is within the scope of the invention that the linear guide rail <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> be parallel to the axis <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> method capable of testing a displacement transducer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is illustrated including moving the transducer to a desired displacement (block <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>) and determining an electrical signal value from the transducer (block <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>). The operations illustrated in blocks <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> are repeated a plurality of times so that the entire displacement of the transducer, or a desired portion thereof, can be tested. Thus, if more displacements are to be measured (block <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>), then the transducer is moved to a new desired displacement (block <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>) and the process is repeated. If no further displacements are to be measured (block <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>), a statistical model is created (block <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>) that represents the data taken. This model can take many forms, for example, the model can be a best-fitting curve model, a least square curve model, a least square linear model, or a least square linear regression model. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Based upon the model chosen, an error is determined for each displacement position (block <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>) and each error is compared to a predetermined tolerance (block <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>). If an error exceeds the tolerance, the transducer fails the test (block <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>). Alternatively, if a secondary tolerance is established, the transducer fails the test if more than a predetermined number of errors exceed the predetermined tolerance. But if no error exceeds the tolerance, or if fewer than the predetermined number of errors exceed the predetermined tolerance (as described above) the transducer passes the test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The following data represent the testing of a Rayelco&trade; model PV-750A position/velocity transducer according to the present invention. The transducer is a draw-wire transducer having an extendable portion that can be extended up to approximately 19 meters. The transducer has a specification accuracy of &plus;/&minus;0.1% of full scale; thus, the specification accuracy of this particular transducer is &plus;/&minus;19.05 mm. Accordingly, the tolerance for each of the displacements to be measured is &plus;/&minus;19.05 mm. The excitation voltage applied to the transducer during the test was 9.9946 Vdc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> To begin the test, the wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> was attached to the extendable portion <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> was moved into contact with the stop block <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> was then clamped to the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. For the first 1219 mm of displacement, the transducer was tested at 304.8 mm intervals, moving the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> an amount corresponding to each desired displacement interval and reading the displacement measurement from the laser head <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. At that point, the wire was unclamped from the slide and the slide was returned to the reference position against the stop block <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The wire <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> was reclamped to the slide <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the slide was moved 1219.2 mm. The transducer was tested at this displacement and the process repeated until the full extension (18288 mm) was reached. Table 1 provides the measured data, the calculated displacement (based upon the transducer output), and the calculated error of each data point measured. The calculated displacement and, thus, the calculated error were determined using a least square linear regression model. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Thus, as no error exceeded the predetermined tolerance of &plus;/&minus;19.05 mm, the transducer passed the test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The present invention also encompasses a computer-readable program-storage device encoded with instructions that, when executed by a computer, performs some portions of the embodiments of the method of the invention described herein and their equivalents. The present invention further encompasses an apparatus having means for performing some portions of the embodiments of the method of the invention described herein and their equivalents.
