<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to protective covers and more particularly to a waterproof protective bag for covering motors of hand-held lawn equipment, appliances and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, the engines, motors and electronics of equipment and appliances, particularly hand-held lawn equipment, can be damaged by exposure to water from rain, sprinklers or misdirected hoses, as well as sun, dirt, dust and other elements during transportation and storage. Such damage often results in costly repairs or even replacement of the equipment. Moreover, even notwithstanding such damage, exposure of the motorized portion of equipment to the elements can reduce the useful life span of the equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Thus, a need exists for a device to protect the engine or motorized portions of equipment, appliances and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The relevant prior art includes the following U.S. Pat. Nos.:

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The objects of this invention are to provide a protective cover that: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> protects engines and motor portions of equipment, appliances and the like during transportation and storage; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> is securely fastened around the engine motor portion so it will not come off during transportation; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> that is self-supporting on its bottom in an open position to allow for easy use; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> that is waterproof; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> that provides an advertising medium; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> that can be made in a variety of sizes and colors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention fulfills the above and other objects by providing a protective bag that has at least two side walls sewn together with an opening between the side walls, the opening having closure means around the opening to secure the bag around equipment. The closure means may comprise a drawstring inserted into spaced apart holes on the side walls around the opening that can be pulled as tightly as necessary to secure it around the equipment. The invention may also further involve a squeeze-type cord lock on the drawstring to maintain the opening in a desired size when fastened around the equipment. The bag may also have a bottom wall between the two side walls opposite the opening. The bag of the present invention may be made of flexible or rigid material so that it can rest on the bottom wall on a surface of a side walls extending upward to maintain the opening between the side walls so equipment can be inserted easily when needed. The bag may also be made of waterproof material, such as boat canvas. The walls of the bag may also serve as an advertising medium by containing logotypes of various companies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention should become even more readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings wherein there is shown and described illustrative embodiments of the invention.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the protective bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> resting on a surface <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as it would appear when not in use. The bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a bottom <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> which is surrounded by preferably circular walls <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> having an opening <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at the top. As shown, bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a drawstring <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> that is inserted through spaced apart holes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> in the walls around the opening <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so that the opening <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be closed to securely fasten the bag around the motors or engines of the equipment to be protected. A squeeze-type cord lock <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be used as a closure means to secure the bag around the equipment it is protecting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a top view of the protective bag of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> having the same components with the exception that the diameter <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of the bag is shown. Although the protective bag could take almost any shape, it would preferably have a circular opening <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a protective bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as it would appear covering the motor <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of a hand-held lawn equipment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, the opening <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> would be closed by pulling the drawstring <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> through the cord lock <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> so that it stays securely on the lawn equipment <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> even while it is being transported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the protective bag <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as it would appear covering a household appliance <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

This embodiment does not have a bottom per se but has a closed end <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and side walls <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to form a tube with the same type of closure means described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The protective bag may also service as an advertising medium by carrying advertising or logotypes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the walls <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The bag may be made from boat canvas or similar material that is waterproof so as to better protect the motors or engines from inclement weather. The bag may be made in a variety different colors. The size of the bags may vary from small bags for small household appliances all the way up to a larger bag for commercial mower engines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Although only a few embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail hereinabove, all improvements and modifications to this invention within the scope or equivalents of the claims are included as part of this invention. </paragraph>
