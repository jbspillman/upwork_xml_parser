<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to rotary transformers, and more particularly to a rotary transformer with a synchronized mode of operation that transfers both power and data between two structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Rotary transformers are often used for transmitting both data and power between two structures that rotate relative to one another, such as between a vehicle tire and its corresponding wheel axle in a tire pressure sensor system. In another example, a rotary transformer can be used to couple data and power from a steering column to a steering wheel, as disclosed in co-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 6,121,692, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As is known in the art, loosely coupled power transformers do not conduct power efficiently between the primary and secondary of the transformer. Instead, a part of the input current into the primary coil stores energy in the leakage inductance of the coil. Prior art structures often include a Zener diode across the primary to absorb the energy of the voltage spike that occurs in the transformer when the current to the primary coil is turned off. More particularly, the Zener diode will conduct current before the drive transistor in the primary side breaks down. However, under this approach, the stored energy is dissipated as heat, thereby wasting the energy built up in the primary coil&apos;s leakage inductance and lowering the power coupling efficiency of the transformer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To overcome this problem, conventional rotary transformer designs tend to focus on methods of increasing the coupling efficiency by constructing a magnetically efficient structure for power transmission, such as by using more expensive, high-efficiency core materials, and then adding a complex load impedance mechanism for providing limited two-way communication through the transformer. This results in an overly complicated structure requiring close mechanical tolerances, which increases the manufacturing cost of the system. Further, the bandwidth for these structures tends to be relatively narrow, which limits the amount of data or the speed at which data can be transmitted between the primary and secondary sides of the transformer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> To increase the bandwidth in the rotary transformer, a loosely coupled rotary transformer that includes a resonant circuit, such as a resonating capacitor connected to a power MOS transistor, may be coupled across the primary coil of the transformer, as described in co-pending, co-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/395,817 filed on Sep. 14, 1999, the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. In the loosely coupled rotary transformer, the resonant circuit is connected and disconnected from the transformer during a power transfer mode and a data transfer mode, respectively. During the power transfer mode, stored energy in the leakage inductance of the primary coil is used for the power coupling, via the resonant circuit, instead of being dissipated as heat. The resonant circuit is disconnected from the rotary transformer during the data transfer mode to maximize bandwidth for two-way data transfer between the primary and secondary sides of the transformer. Including the resonant circuit in the loosely coupled transformer optimizes data and power transfer without requiring the use of high-cost, high-efficiency magnetic structures in the core of the transformer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The loosely coupled rotary transformer utilizes a fixed frequency drive circuit, and a resonant drive mode that is very power efficient compared to other known rotary transformer drive methods. The transformer resonant frequency and drive frequency is matched for the nominal supply voltage and secondary load. However, a problem may arise when the supply voltage is not properly regulated, or the secondary load is subject to large changes from a nominal level. In both cases, the power coupling efficiency may decrease from a nominal level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The inventors of the present invention have recognized this problem and have modified the operation of the rotary transformer drive circuit to maintain high power efficiency for changes in either supply voltage or secondary load. This is especially important for vehicle operation where the supply voltage for proper operation may vary between a voltage of approximately 9.0 and approximately 16.0 volts, which is almost a 2:1 ratio. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The invention comprises a rotary transformer with a synchronous mode of operation to facilitate the transfer of power and two-way communications between two structures, such as a column and steering wheel of a vehicle. During normal operation, the rotary transformer repetitively alternates between a power transfer mode and a data transfer mode by multiplexing time across the rotary transformer. A microprocessor supplies a pulse train that periodically applies full power from a power supply, such as a vehicle battery to the transformer&apos;s primary coil, or &ldquo;column coil.&rdquo; In the referenced prior patent, during the power mode when the pulses supplied to the primary coil are &ldquo;on&rdquo;, the microprocessor disconnects a resonating or tuning capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> from the primary coil. When the pulses are &ldquo;off&rdquo;, the resonating capacitor is reconnected, at which time energy stored in the resonating capacitor is supplied across the rotary transformer. By connecting the resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the primary coil only when the pulses are turned &ldquo;off&rdquo;, the power required to drive the rotary transformer is minimized and the energy recovered from the primary coil is maximized. For synchronized operation, the subject of this application, the tuning capacitor is connected during the entire power mode. It is disconnected only during the data transfer mode. The microprocessor can also adjust the width of the pulses supplied to the primary coil to maintain a constant power level at the wheel circuit using means well known in the art, such as a voltage regulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> After a preset length of time allotted for the power transfer mode, the microprocessor causes the primary circuit to change to the data transfer mode. During this mode, the primary circuit transmits a preset number of data bits to the secondary side across the rotary transformer, and then the secondary side transmits a preset number of bits to the primary circuit across the rotary transformer. Then, the circuit returns to the power transfer mode and repeats the sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the invention is that during the power transfer mode, the drive transistor of the coil drive circuit is switched &ldquo;on&rdquo; when the voltage across the primary coil changes from positive to negative at approximately one half of a cycle to provide a synchronous mode of operation. This synchronized mode of operation virtually eliminates a current spike through the diode of the coil drive circuit that exists using conventional modes of operation, which turn the drive transistor &ldquo;on&rdquo; at the end of the power transfer mode, such as in fixed frequency and variable frequency modes of operation. By preventing the current spike through the diode of the coil drive circuit, the stress to the driving transistor and electromagnetic interference to the operating environment of the rotary transformer are minimized. In addition, the synchronous mode operation of the invention provides the microprocessor a sufficient amount of time to recognize the change of the resonant waveform of the primary circuit during the power transfer mode so that it can change the output ports, unlike conventional modes of operation.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a rotary transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> using a fixed frequency to transfer power and data between two structures, such as a column circuit and a wheel circuit of a steering wheel of a vehicle. The transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a primary side <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> having a primary coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a secondary side <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> having a secondary coil <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The voltage potential across the primary coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is referred to as Vp, and the current passing through the primary coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is referred to as Ip. The voltage potential across secondary coil <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is referred to as Vs. Resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are placed across the primary coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and secondary coil <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, respectively, to control any ringing produced by the transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> due to the loose coupling. Typically, the resistance values of resistors R<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and R<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are reduced until the primary and secondary resonant circuits formed by the transformer&apos;s <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> leakage inductance and stray capacitance are critically damped. As a result, when the capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is disconnected during the power transfer mode, the transformer&apos;s <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> bandwidth is very large, allowing the invention to transmit digitally controlled pulse trains as well as various limited bandwidth sine wave coding schemes, such as frequency-shift keying (FSK) or other comparable schemes. Thus, the large bandwidth produced by the structure in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> allows large amounts of virtually any data type to be transmitted between the primary and secondary sides, which is advantageous in various automotive applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are placed across the primary coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to form a resonant circuit <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>. As a result, the stored energy in the leakage inductance of the primary coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is coupled to the resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when the drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned off. In doing so, the primary side of the transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> continues to couple energy to the secondary side after the drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned off, increasing the power coupling efficiency and decreasing the overall amount of heat generated by the transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The rotary transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also includes a diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> connected to the collector of the transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is illustrated as an n-channel MOS driver to form a coil drive circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a negligible effect on the data transfer and permits the primary voltage Vp to go below ground, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, thus extending the period of active power coupling between the primary and secondary sides of the transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The increase in the power coupling time generally increases the overall power efficiency enough to more than compensate for the additional loss due to the forward voltage drop across diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. If transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a bipolar NPN transistor rather than an n-channel MOS driver as described above, diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may not be needed, provided that the collector swing of the bipolar NPN transistor is less than its base-emitter breakdown voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> series connected capacitor C<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a resistor R<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected between the driven side of the coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the common ground. This permits the AC voltage at the drive side of coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, Point C, to be coupled to a microcomputer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, which controls the signals applied to control inputs A and B. In a preferred embodiment, the pulse train is supplied at a frequency of approximately 25 kHz. The pulse duration of the pulse train determines the amount of power that is transferred from the primary side to the secondary side of transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> full wave rectifier <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may be connected to the transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to extract the power being coupled to the secondary side during the power transfer mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A preferred set of waveforms for the power transfer mode of the non-synchronized operating mode of the prior art is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In operation, a positive control voltage V<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>applied to the gate of drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the coil drive circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> turns Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on. Simultaneously an inverted control voltage V<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>is applied to the gate of transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the resonant circuit <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to turn Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> off. As a result, the primary coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has a voltage potential very close to ground potential, and the voltage Vp across the primary coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is approximately equal to V<highlight><subscript>BATT</subscript></highlight>. After a delay of Td, the drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the coil drive circuit <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is turned off and the drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the resonant circuit <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is turned on. The stored energy in the leakage inductance of the primary coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> generates a damped sine wave for voltage Vp across the primary coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Provided that the load is at its maximum level and the battery voltage V<highlight><subscript>BATT </subscript></highlight>is at its minimum level, and the resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is sized for these levels, the sine wave will have just completed one cycle at time Tp when the cycle will be repeated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown in the waveforms of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is disconnected by turning drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> off whenever drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on. As a result, drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> does not have to supply any current I<highlight><subscript>C1 </subscript></highlight>to resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, allowing all of the drive current to go to the transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. When the drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is turned off, the stored energy in the primary leakage inductance resonantly couples the resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and then moves back to the primary leakage inductance for continuous power coupling with the secondary side. In other words, placing the resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, rather than a Zener diode, across the primary coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> allows the energy stored in the primary leakage inductance of the coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to be used for power coupling rather than wasted as dissipated heat. Note that power MOS transistors can conduct in either direction, a function that is necessary for resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to be effective as a resonating capacitor in the illustrated embodiment. If a bipolar NPN transistor were to be used instead of the power MOS transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a diode would need to be placed between the collector and emitter terminals of the bipolar NPN transistor for the circuit to function in the same manner as a circuit containing the power MOS transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> increases the power coupling efficiency of the inventive transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. However, the resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> tends to limit the bandwidth of the data transfer to an undesirably low level. To avoid this problem, the invention preferably time-multiplexes the data and the power modes, continuously switching between the two modes to provide both efficient power transfer and a wide bandwidth for two-way data transfer. More particularly, control voltage V<highlight><subscript>B </subscript></highlight>is input into drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, turning drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on and off to connect and disconnect resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and switch the transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> between operating in the power transfer mode for a fixed time period, e.g. 5 ms, and in the data mode for a fixed time period, e.g. 500 &mgr;s. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> preferably cycles continuously between the two modes. The bit rate and/or the duration of the data transfer mode can be modified in any known manner to optimize the amount of data transferred between the primary and secondary sides. For example, using a 100 kHz data rate (10 &mgr;s period) transfers 50 bits of data between the primary side and the secondary side in 500 &mgr;s. Experimental studies with a low-cost air core transformer show that data bit rates over 1 MHz are possible in the invention. Furthermore, inserting a 500 &mgr;s data transfer period once every 5 ms of power transfer time reduces the power mode duty factor by only 10%. Depending on the particular application in which the inventive transformer circuit is used, the length of the data transfer period can be smaller than 0.1% of the power transfer period. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> One advantage of the invention is that the transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> provides both an acceptable power transfer and data transfer without requiring specialized, higher-cost magnetic materials, allowing the inventive circuit to be manufactured with lower-cost, easily available air core transformers. More particularly, including a resonant control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> across the primary coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in a loosely coupled transformer allows energy stored in the leakage inductance of the primary coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to be coupled to the secondary side rather than being wasted as dissipated heat. Further, the invention can switch between power transfer and data transfer modes by simply connecting and disconnecting the resonant control circuit <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, making the circuit of the invention much simpler than known structures using complex load impedance mechanisms for generating data transfer capabilities in a transformer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Under normal operating conditions, the supply voltage V<highlight><subscript>BATT </subscript></highlight>is larger than the minimum level, and the load is less than its maximum level. The pulse width will be decreased to maintain a constant secondary voltage Vs. Under these conditions the resonant sine wave will be interrupted after more than a complete cycle has been completed. The resulting waveforms, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, disclose a very high spike in the current through diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as the driving transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on. The spike not only increases stress to the driving transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, but also causes electromagnetic interference that is not desirable in the automotive environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> One solution to these problems is to operate the transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at a variable frequency, rather than at a fixed frequency described above. Operating the transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at a variable frequency permits precisely one cycle of the data transfer mode before switching to the power mode of operation. Operating the transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at a variable frequency could be accomplished by monitoring the transformer primary voltage Vp at point C and turning the drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on and the resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> off just as the primary voltage Vp changes from negative to positive at time Td. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> However, some problems may exist using the variable frequency approach described above. One problem is that the rate of change of the waveform for the primary voltage Vp occurs in about four (4) to six (6) volts per microsecond. As a result, the microprocessor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> would have to recognize the change in the primary voltage Vp from a negative-to-positive voltage and then change the output ports all within about 0.2 &mgr;s, which may be impractical for a low cost automotive microprocessor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The inventors have recognized this problem and have provided a transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with a synchronous mode of operation that virtually eliminates the spike in the current through diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> when the driving transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on while providing the microprocessor an adequate amount of time to change the output ports. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is switched on when the voltage at Point C changes from negative to positive at one half of a cycle at time Ts, rather than at the end of each complete cycle at time Td as in conventional transformers. When the drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is turned on at time Ts, the drive current Ip will not flow because of diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a negative primary voltage Vp at Point C, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. After a half cycle when the voltage Vp at Point C changes from negative to positive, the drive current I<highlight><subscript>Q1 </subscript></highlight>will automatically flow because the drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has already been switched on. It will be appreciated that the time Ts may occur when the primary voltage Vp is slightly positive because the primary voltage Vp may not drop completely to zero during the data transfer mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Using the synchronous mode of operation of the invention, the amount of time for the microcomputer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to change the output ports is greatly improved as compared to conventional approaches. For example, at a resonant frequency of approximately 50 kHz, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has 10 microseconds to recognize a state change a resonant frequency of approximately 50 kHz using the invention, instead of 0.2 microseconds using conventional approaches. Thus, the invention provides a factor of 50 reduction in speed requirement of the microprocessor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the speed requirement of the microprocessor <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> practical in an automotive environment. Moreover, because the capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is charged to less than one volt, the resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> does not have to be switched off during the power transfer mode of operation. Because the drive current I<highlight><subscript>Q1 </subscript></highlight>is switched from off-to-on and from on-to-off at essentially zero voltage across the resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, there are no large current spikes, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Instead, the primary coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can simply switch between the resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In summary, the invention switches the drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on to connect the resonating capacitor C<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to the primary coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> during the power transfer mode and disconnected during the data transfer mode. During the power transfer mode, the microcomputer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> detects the transition of voltage Vp across the primary coil <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (at point C) from a positive-to-negative and turns the drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on. The drive transistor Q<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is switched off when the coupled energy to the transformer secondary coil <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is sufficient to provide sufficient power to the secondary side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the invention is that at nominal power loads, the transformer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> using the synchronous mode of operation of the invention has the same power efficiency as a transformer using a fixed frequency mode of operation. Another aspect of the invention is that when the supply voltage, V<highlight><subscript>BATT </subscript></highlight>or the secondary load changes, the invention can adapt and maintain very high power efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the waveforms for the control voltage V<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>and the transformer primary voltage Vp for a battery voltage V<highlight><subscript>BATT </subscript></highlight>of approximately 14 volts and a nominal secondary load using the synchronous mode of operation of the invention. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the transitions between the power transfer and data transfer modes are continuous without any abrupt discontinuities at the mode changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the waveforms for the control voltage V<highlight><subscript>A </subscript></highlight>and the transformer primary voltage Vp that result when the battery voltage, V<highlight><subscript>BATT</subscript></highlight>, drops from approximately 14 volts to about 8 volts with approximately the same secondary load as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the period for the power transfer mode is longer to supply the same average power to the secondary side at a lower supply voltage, V<highlight><subscript>BATT</subscript></highlight>. However, the transitions between the power transfer and data transfer modes are continuous and lack any abrupt discontinuities at the mode changes, similar to the waveforms in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been specifically described in connection with certain specific embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that this is by way of illustration and not of limitation, and the scope of the appended claims should be construed as broadly as the prior art will permit. </paragraph>
