<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention is directed to integrated circuit chips and wiring interconnect structures involving the metal copper, known as back end of the line (BEOL) structures, and in particular to a structure and process of forming an interface with a thin single alloy layer on copper interconnect metal in a semiconductor device that provides improved adhesion to subsequent deposited layers, protection against copper diffusion and resistance to electromigration and a lower interconnect dielectric constant. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the fabrication of chip network circuitry involving the metal copper, interconnected to the vias and trenches of the network, those vias and trenches have been interconnected heretofore in the art through metalization type processes utilizing standard sequential procedures of thick dielectric deposition of such materials as SiO2 or low dielectric constant (K) materials, hardmask deposition, via and trench opening formation, deposition of thin liner film on via and trench walls, filling vias and trenches with copper metal, planarization of the top copper surface, and finally capping the top surface of the planarized copper with protective dielectric layers for preventing copper migration into the next upper dielectric layer which is usually of SiO2, Si3N4, or a capping type arrangement such as a multiple layer structure known in the art as BLOK, or other low dielectric constant (K) material, and, for minimizing interactions with the copper while the upper dielectric layer is deposited and processed. The final capping layer, further then can serve as a reactive ion etch stop layer for patterning a next upper dielectric layer. This procedure has come to be known in the art as &ldquo;the integration scheme for Cu-BEOL&rdquo;. The process is repeated for each subsequent level of the interconnect wiring. Heretofore in the art the capping layer has been quite thick and has resulted in excessive dielectric loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Thus far in the art, in chip network interconnections employing the metal copper, there have been interdependent considerations resulting from the possible electromigration of the copper and the adhesion properties of any layer that serves a capping function in the overall process and the thickness and properties of any capping layer on the dielectric constant of the interconnect. There has been some progress in the art heretofore. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In patent application Ser. No. 09/510,259, Filed Feb. 22, 2000, assigned to the assignee of this application, there is described a sequence of processes for forming dual protective layers made up of a bilayer metal cap/insulator (known as a BLOK layer in the art) that is positioned on the surface of Cu conductors of semiconductor devices to protect the Cu surface and to provide improved adhesion and reliability as layers are processed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In patent application Ser. No. 09/361,573, Filed Jul. 27, 1999, assigned to the assignee of this application efforts in the control of electromigration through the control of the Cu/dielectric interface are advanced through using deposited surface films. There is a need in the art for capping layer, inter layer diffusion, adhesion and electromigration while maintaining high performance and reliability. </paragraph>

The interface may be employed at each level of a multilevel integrated structure. It has been found, in accordance with the invention, that a single layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, of an alloy of the A-X-Y type, where the ingredient A is a member of the group of Co and Ni, the ingredient X is a member of the group of W, Sn and Si, and the ingredient Y is a member of the group of P and B; in contact with the surface <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the copper interconnect <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, with a thickness in the range of 50-300 Angstroms, with 50-75 Angstroms being preferred; and surrounded with a hard mask type material layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of for example Si3N4 or the material in the art known as BLOK positioned on the copper <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The interface of the invention which may be used at level transitions in multilevel interconnecting vias provides an interconnect with improved electrical properties as measured through reduced dielectric constant; reduced electromigration and diffusion. Further, processing control is achieved through the reactive ion etch stopping properties of the hard mask type material layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the flexibility of the interface of the invention, in balancing the conflicting aspects of ingredient properties and processing performance, in producing an improved electrical performance interconnecting contact, is illustrated in connection with an interconnection structure of the type known in the art as dual damascene, wherein the copper portion of the interconnect undergoes cross sectional changes. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, wherein the reference numeral system of the previous figure is continued, the interconnect structure is described as formed in a general fabrication order in which the copper member <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has portions <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>C in an opening within liners <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> through dielectric <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in a preprocessed substrate <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> There is thus indicated that there is a 5.8% reduction in effective dielectric constant in an integrated array with interconnections of the invention having a thin single alloy capping layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The interface and interconnecting structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> provides the control of diffusion of the materials as shown in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> which is a graph illustrating the diffusion that takes place in structures employing the invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> involving an Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) depth profile illustrating the barrier benefits There is illustrated the diffusion prevention properties of the single alloy layer, element <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, in this instance of a 100A thickness of CoWP as an example diffusion barrier on copper. The Cobalt signal is labelled &ldquo;Co&rdquo; and the Copper signal is labelled &ldquo;Cu&rdquo; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The graph illustrates that the capping layer of the invention provides a diffusion barrier that causes the Cu signal to approach zero within 50 nanometers of the Co film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The thin alloy capping layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> is effective in providing a barrier to electromigration. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4 a</cross-reference> graph is provided illustrating the effect of the invention on electromigration properties of an example 100 Angstrom thick alloy CoWP capping layer. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the graph is considered to be showing that there is increased resistance to electromigration imparted to the structure of the invention by the applying of the 100A thickness single alloy layer of CoWP on the copper surface at a temperature of 249 degrees C. at a current of 1 mA. In the graph the dotted lines represent interconnects not having the CoWP layer whereas the solid lines represent similar structures with the single CoWP, 100 A thickness layer. The data along the abcissa scale is considered indicative that the interconnects with the single alloy capping layer of the invention perform at least six times better than structures without the capping layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The fabrication of interconnects with the invention is generally achieved by filling with copper an electrically isolated lined opening in hardmask material surface of a preprocessed substrate, chemical-mechanical planarization of the copper and hardmask surface and electrolessly depositing the single layer alloy. The invention can involve first providing a pre processed substrate that has a copper conductor member formed in a thick layer of a dielectric that has a layer of a subsequent etching resistant hard mask material on the surface of the dielectric and surrounding the copper member, then depositing an alloy film in the range of 50 to 300 Angstroms thick on the copper. The technique of electroless deposition, including the use of a nucleation layer of Pd particles, standard in the art, is used for the deposition of the alloy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, following the selective deposition of the metal alloy film, the preprocessed substrate can be subjected to a temperature excursion to the Vicinity of 300 degrees C. in a reducing atmosphere for a length of time that is sufficient for a metal alloy film barrier to be formed by diffusion a few atomic layers into the copper surface. The resulting partial product at this point is a copper conductor member situated in an insulating and etch resistant layer with a metal alloy layer barrier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The partial product at this point inparts to the copper interconnect a low dielectric constant and with good adhesion to subsequent layers and with good diffusion barrier properties; in which, further, the standard problems of voids and hillocks encountered with the type of heavy capping layer used heretofore, are avoided with this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The metal alloy that produces the barrier is made up of a metal alloy of the type generally represented by A-X-Y in which the primary ingredient X is Co or Ni while X and Y are minor alloy modifiers to tailor the properties of the alloy. The ingredient X is usually a member of the group of W, Sn, and Si and the ingredient Y is usually a member of the group of P and B. An acceptable example is 86-90% wt. of Co or Ni; 1-5% wt of W and 6-12% wt of P in the film. What has been described is a copper interconnect structural interface involving a single, about 50-300 A thick, alloy capping layer, that controls diffusion and electromigration of the interconnection components and reduces the overall effective dielectric constant of the interconnect; the capping layer being surrounded by a material referred to in the art as hardmask material that can provide a resist for subsequent reactive etching operations, and there is also provided the interdependent process steps in fabrication. </paragraph>
