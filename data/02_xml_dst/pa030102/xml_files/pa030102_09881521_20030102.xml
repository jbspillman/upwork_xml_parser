<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to furniture, and in particular to pieces of furniture that support electrical or electronic equipment, such as plasma screen or flat screen television sets, computer monitors, and other devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As technology has advanced, more and more television sets and computer monitors are being manufactured that are substantially thinner than prior television sets and computer monitors. Such thin screen technology includes plasma screen televisions, flat screen displays for both computers and televisions, as well as other technologies. As these technologies have become more prevalent, the need for furniture specifically adapted to support these thin screen media has grown. Existing furniture has generally been ill suited to support these thin screen media because of the very thinness of the media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For example, plasma screen televisions may have a thickness of only several inches but a height and width of several feet. This shape makes these screens very prone to tipping if they are not properly secured. Prior art television display cabinets often do not have the means to prevent such tipping, and also tend to have shelf depths that are far greater than is necessary to accommodate plasma screen televisions. Furthermore, the height and width of plasma screen televisions is generally greater than that of standard television sets. This further renders prior art television cabinets incapable of supporting plasma screen televisions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Apart from the inability of prior art furniture to easily accommodate thin display media, prior art furniture has also suffered from further disadvantages. Specifically, prior art furniture that is designed to support electrical or electronic equipment has generally been poor at facilitating the installation and any modifications that are made to the equipment supported on the furniture. As one example, prior art television stands generally include a back wall with one or more relatively small holes through which various cords associated with the television are threaded. These cords typically include at least a power cord and a cord for communicating with a VCR or DVD player, or other device supported on the stand. When installing these and other electronic devices on the stand, the cords often have to be threaded through these holes while the stand is positioned up against a wall. This substantially prevents access to the rear of the stand and makes the installation or modification of the cord connections difficult. Further, after the stand has been set up in its desired location, gaining access to power outlets or communications ports located behind the television stand is exceedingly difficult. The need can therefore be seen for a type of furniture that overcomes these difficulties and allows easy set-up and modification of electronic components and their wire connections. The need can also be seen for a type of furniture that can accommodate thin display media. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention provides a new type of furniture referred to herein as a media wall. The media wall is specially adapted to facilitate the installation and set-up of electronic components, as well as any changes made to either the electrical components or the wires connected to the components. The media wall is also specially adapted to support thin display media. The media wall further allows easy access to be obtained to power and other types of communication ports. Still further, the media wall accomplishes all of these functions in an aesthetically pleasing manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A media wall according to one aspect of the present invention includes an upright vertical wall having a front face and a back face. At least one aperture is defined in the wall and is adapted to allow at least one cable to extend from the front face to the back face of the wall. A support is also provided and is adapted to be affixed to a stationary structure. A hinge is attached to the support and the wall, and allows the wall to pivot about a vertical axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A media wall according to another aspect of the present invention includes an upright vertical wall with a front and back face. At least one shelf is attached to, and extends forwardly from, the upright wall. A support is provided and adapted to be fixed to a stationary structure. A hinge is attached to the support and the wall and is arranged to allow the wall to pivot about a vertical axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A media wall according to still another aspect of the present invention includes an upright, vertical wall having a front and back face. A pair of sidewalls are attached to the back face of the upright wall. At least one shelf is attached to the front face of the wall and extends forwardly therefrom. A support is affixed to the wall and is adapted to be attached to a stationary structure such that the support secures the wall in a fixed position when the support is affixed to a stationary structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In still other aspects of the invention, the media wall may include an adjustable video camera support mounted on the front face of the wall. One or more drawers may also be included on the wall for storage. A conduit, such as a cable trough or other structure, may be provided on the back face of the wall for holding any cable(s) used to operate the electronic equipment supported on the media wall. The sidewalls may also include data, telephone, and power ports to allow other electrical devices to both draw power through the media wall and to communicate with the electrical devices supported on the media wall. The shelf may include a pivotable panel disposed at the rear end of the shelf which pivots to allow greater access between the front and back faces of the media wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The media wall of the present invention provides a convenient and aesthetically pleasing structure for supporting thin display media, as well as video cameras and other related electronic devices. The media wall conceals the electrical cabling necessary to operate such equipment while still allowing easy access to such equipment for maintenance and modification purposes. The media wall provides these advantages while taking up only a minimum amount of space. These and other benefits of the present invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art in light of the following specification when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals correspond to like elements in the several drawings. A media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> according to one aspect of the present invention is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown positioned in front of a building or structural wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which may be a permanent or semi-permanent wall that one would find in an office or a residential home. Structural wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> forms no part of the present invention. In the illustrated embodiment, media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is constructed to be pivotable with respect to structural wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, in order to allow easy access to the structures located between media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and structural wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a front face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on which one or more plasma screen televisions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> or other types of media display devices may be mounted (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>). Such mounting may occur at any desirable location along front face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may include one or more apertures <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which allow cords to be passed from the devices mounted on front face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to a back face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). A shelf <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may also be provided on front face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to support additional electronic components, such as DVD players, VCRs, CD players, or other equipment. An opening behind shelf <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is provided to allow the cables from these devices to be inserted to the back side of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As will be explained in more detail below, outlets may be provided within media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> adjacent shelf <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and in other areas which allow the electronic devices to plug directly into media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for power. The wiring and cords necessary to implement the particular media devices which a user has chosen are all easily implemented or modified by way of the pivoting action of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which allows easy access to back face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A video camera support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is mounted on media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to support a video camera which may be used to implement teleconference calls. Video camera support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be both horizontally and vertically adjustable, as described more fully herein. Video camera support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may, of course, be used to support devices other than video cameras. A pair of drawers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are also included in media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on opposite sides of shelf <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to provide storage space for items associated with the mounted electronic components, as well as other items. Drawers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are slidable forwardly from media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such that they can be accessed by a user standing in front of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A second shelf <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> above first shelf <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is also provided and creates additional space for supporting equipment that may be desirably supported on media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is pivotable about a vertical axis <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> positioned adjacent one side of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The pivoting of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> occurs by way of a hinge or other suitable device attached between a stationary support <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a frame <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Stationary support <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> supports frame <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and all of its attachments as it pivots. Stationary support <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes a straight section <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, a knee <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and a top support <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A mounting plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is attached to the bottom of both straight section <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and knee <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Mounting plates <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> each include a plurality of fastener holes for use with screws, bolts, etc. to firmly mount stationary support <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the floor. Top support <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is mounted to structural wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by way of any suitable fasteners, such as screws, bolts, nails, or other types of fasteners. In order to ensure a proper mounting, the fasteners inserted through top support <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> should be inserted into one or more studs in stationary wall <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Stationary support <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is preferably made from any suitably strong metal, such as steel, although other materials can be used. It will be understood by one skilled in the art that the structure of stationary support <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> can vary considerably from that described herein and depicted in the attached drawings without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Frame <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> generally has a rectangular shape that matches the shape of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Frame <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> includes a top section <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, a bottom section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and a pair of side sections <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which are all secured together and designed to support the weight of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. While frame <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be made of any suitably strong material, it has been found that aluminum provides sufficient strength to support media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> while still being relatively lightweight. Frame <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> generally extends about the periphery of a main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and is secured thereto by way of any suitable fasteners, such as screws, bolts, nails, or others. Such fasteners are used in sufficient number and inserted into main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to a sufficient depth to firmly secure main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and frame <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> together without having any of the fasteners visible on front face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A pair of sidewalls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are attached to back face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Sidewalls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>extend rearwardly from back face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> a relatively small distance, such as six inches or less, although greater distances are contemplated within the scope of the invention. At least one sidewall <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> preferably includes a connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) disposed within the sidewall. In the most preferred embodiment, each sidewall <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>includes a connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Connection panels <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> provides an interface for a variety of electrical and electronic cords or cables. For example, connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may include a power outlet <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) into which electrical or electronic devices may be plugged in order to receive electrical power. Connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may also include a telephone jack <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> into which a telephone or other device that uses telephonic communications may be inserted. Connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> may still further include a video jack <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and a data jack <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Video jack <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> allows a cable over which video signals are transmitted, such as one used in connection with a VCR or DVD player, to be inserted into connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Data jack <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> allows a cable over which electronic data is transmitted, such as an Internet or other network connection, to be inserted into connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Telephone, video, and data jacks <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> allow one or more telephones, computers, or other electronic equipment to be plugged into connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> on a sidewall <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and thereby be able to communicate with one or more electronic devices mounted on media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as well as external networks, as will be described in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A wiring diagram illustrating the wiring for media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> according to one preferred embodiment is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. A power wire <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is connected to connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and extends along a horizontal wire management channel <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> mounted on back face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Power wire <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extends horizontally in channel <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to generally a midpoint of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and then extends vertically in a vertical wire management channel <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. A power wire <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is connected to connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and extends along horizontal wire management channel <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to generally the midpoint of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. From there, wire <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>extends vertically upward along vertical wire management channel <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, where it is electrically coupled to wire <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Power wires <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>terminate at any desired location along vertical wire management channel <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in one or more power outlets <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Alternatively, power wires <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can terminate along horizontal wire management channel <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> in outlets <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. As yet another alternative, power wires <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be arranged to provide power outlets <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at any desirable location or locations on back face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Power outlets <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are preferably positioned such that power cords from electronic devices mounted to the front face of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> or supported on shelves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be plugged into these power outlets <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to receive power. While any number of power outlets can be used within the scope of the invention, at least four power outlets are preferably provided. Power wires <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are electrically coupled to a plug <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> which can be inserted into a power outlet connected to a power source, such as a conventional power outlet in a wall, a power strip, or any other source of electrical power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, eight power outlets <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are provided on the back face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Five of these power outlets <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are electrically coupled to a plurality of electrical cords or wires <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>which supply power to a variety of electrical devices <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. Wire <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>provides power to a first electrical device <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, which may be a VGA automatic switcher, as will be described in more detail below. Wire <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>provides electrical power to device <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which is positioned on video camera support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Device <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is preferably a video camera that may be used for video-conferencing, although other types of electrical devices can be mounted on support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Wires <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>provide power to two electrical devices <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>located on lower shelf <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Electrical devices <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>may be CD players, DVD players, VCRs, a combination of these devices, or any other type of electronic device. Wire <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>is connected to electronic device <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, which may be a plasma screen television mounted to the front face of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, or some other type of media display device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The location of all of the wires <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>may be varied as necessary depending upon the particular implementation of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, it may be possible to position a DVD player on top of upper shelf <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, instead of lower shelf <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Wire <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>would therefore extend from an outlet <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to the back of the device on shelf <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Each wire <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>includes a first end that is inserted into one of outlets <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and a second end which is coupled to the particular electronic device. For DVD players, CD players, and other electrical devices, wires <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may be permanently attached to, and a part of, the particular electronic device which is being supported on media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A phone cable <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is supported in horizontal wire management channel <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and extends from the telephone jack <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the telephone jack <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Phone cable <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is also operatively coupled to a phone plug <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, which is insertable into a standard phone jack in a wall or other device. When phone plug <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is so inserted, a phone connection can be inserted into either or both of the telephone jacks <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in connection panels <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to thereby connect to a phone line. For example, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> laptop computer may be desirably placed on a cart <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. If the laptop includes a modem, it may be desirable to connect the laptop to a working phone line. This can be accomplished by inserting one end of a phone cable into the laptop and the other end into telephone jack <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in connection panel. Provided telephone plug <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is inserted into a conventional phone jack in a wall or other structure, the laptop will then have access to a phone line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A data or network cable <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is coupled between the data jack <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a data plug <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. A second data or network cable <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is coupled between the data jack <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a second data plug <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. When data plugs <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are inserted into a conventional data outlet, such as would typically be found in a structural wall of the office or residence in which media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is present, data can be transmitted to each of the respective data jacks <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. In this manner, a computer or other electronic device which requires a network connection can be plugged into one of data jacks <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. Because each data jack <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is separately wired, two different electronic devices can access a data or network connection simultaneously, such as when one device is hooked up to the data jack <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and another device is hooked up to the data jack <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> in connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A pair of video cables <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are connected respectively at one end to video jacks <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in each connection panel <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The other end of video cables <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are connected to video switching device <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Video switching device <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be a 2-in, 1-out VGA Auto Switcher with Loop Output, such as is sold by Altinex, Inc. of Brea, Calif., under the model number DA1916SX. Other types of video switching equipment may be substituted. Video switcher <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>includes two video inputs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and one output <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Video switcher <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>automatically detects which of the two inputs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are currently transmitting and connects that incoming signal to the output <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. If signals are being received on both inputs <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, switcher <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>selects a default input to connect to output <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Output <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is coupled by a user to a video device, such as a plasma screen television or other device which utilizes a video connection. If media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> only includes a single video jack <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, then a video switcher <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is unnecessary and can be omitted from media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> While cables <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> as being separate cables, they can be physically bundled together into a single cord. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> pair of cables <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are illustrated and should be understood to include a bundling of cables <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Such bundling helps simplify the process for wiring the electronic devices supported on media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Horizontal and vertical wire management channels <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> help further simplify the wiring process and may, in one embodiment, be wire management channels as sold by Dek Cable Accessories, Inc. of St. Charles, Ill., under model no. 046-4030SBP. Other types of channels may also be used within the scope of the present invention to support the cabling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In addition to the foregoing cables, video cables <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> for specific electronic devices. Cable <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>provides a video connection between an electronic device <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, such as a video camera, and the plasma screen or other media display device <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>. Cables <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>provide video connections between the television <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>and each of two different electronic devices <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>on shelf <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. If additional electronic devices that utilize video signals are supported on media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, additional cables would be necessary, as would be understood by one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An aperture <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is defined in main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> at the back of lower shelf <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Aperture <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is, in the preferred embodiment, as long as shelf <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and substantially as high as the vertical separation between lower shelf <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and upper shelf <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. While other dimensions of aperture <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be used within the present invention, these dimensions are preferred in order to allow complete access to the back panels of electronic instruments positioned on shelf <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Such complete access is preferred over smaller apertures which may not align properly with the cables coming out of the back panel of electronic devices, and which make wiring such devices more difficult due to their limited dimensions. A pivotable panel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is mounted adjacent the back end of shelf <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> along a horizontal axis. Pivotable panel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> pivots between a generally upright, vertical position, and a lowered position which may be horizontal or angled. Pivotable panel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at least partially covers aperture <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> when it is pivoted into its upright position. Preferably a gap <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> still remains after pivotable panel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is pivoted to its upright position in order to provide clearance for cables extending from devices on shelf <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the back of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. While not necessary, gap <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is preferably disposed adjacent a top of panel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> as the top area is less visually accessible to passersby passing in front of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Pivotable panel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> thus allows easy access to be gained to the rear of shelf <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> while it is pivoted to a lowered position, and also provides aesthetically pleasing concealment of substantially all of aperture <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> while it is in its upright position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The mounting of one or more plasma screen televisions, or other display media, on media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is accomplished through the use of a conventional plasma screen television mount. These mounts are commercially available and are secured to a desired location on front face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by way of screws or other fasteners. Media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may or may not include apertures <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for allowing the cables attached to the plasma screen television to be passed through main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to back face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. If no such apertures <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are included, then they can be drilled manually by the installer of the plasma screen television of other media display device. Leaving apertures <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> out of media wall <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> allows the user of the media wall to select any location for installing the plasma screen television on front face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> without being limited to the more aesthetically pleasing locations in which the television will conceal apertures <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Further, different models of television may have their cables located at different positions on the television, thus making it difficult to ensure that apertures <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are aligned with the television cables. For this additional reason, it may be desirable to omit apertures <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and allow the user to select the location for these and drill them where desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Video camera support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may also be included as part of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As noted, video camera support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be used to support a video camera for teleconferencing, as well as supporting other devices. Video camera support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes a flat shelf <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> that projects forwardly from front face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). Shelf <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is supported on a main panel <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> by way of a pair of brackets <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Main panel <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> includes a central aperture <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> defined generally at the height of shelf <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and centered in main panel <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Aperture <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> provides an opening for cords and cables which may be attached to a video camera or other electronic device supported on shelf <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. These cords or cables are preferably inserted through aperture <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and run vertically along a back face <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of main panel <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> until they reach the top of support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The cords are concealed from view by a pair of sidewalls <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> extending rearwardly a short distance from back face <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of main panel <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. A hook <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> extends rearwardly from main panel <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> at the top of support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for a first distance, and then drops downwardly for a short distance. Hook <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> hooks over a top edge <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) and supports video camera support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. A space for the wires or cords used with the video camera on support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is provided underneath hook <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. In order to conceal these wires from view, they are preferably inserted through aperture <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, run up the back face <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of main panel <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, passed underneath hook <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and over the top edge <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and then are either inserted into vertical wire management channel <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> or plugged into one of the outlets <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> disposed along the back side of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Hook <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> holds video camera support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> by gravity and therefore can be moved horizontally along the entire top edge <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. A user of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> therefore has the freedom to easily adjust support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to any desired horizontal location on main wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In order to avoid marring or otherwise damaging front face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, video camera support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> preferable includes a plurality of pegs <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> that have a felt tipped surface <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, or other type of non-abrasive surface. Surfaces <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> contact front face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> when support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is used and therefore should not only be of a non-abrasive material, but should include sufficient surface area to avoid causing any indentation into front face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> due to the weight of support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the items supported thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In addition to being horizontally adjustable, video camera support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be altered from that depicted in the attached drawings to be vertically adjustable. While any type of vertical adjustability mechanisms are contemplated within the scope of the present invention, one such mechanism might include defining a plurality of holes in main panel <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> into which brackets <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be selectively inserted. Brackets <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> could then be removed and inserted into whichever of the plurality of holes was located at the desired height. Shelf <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> would then be supported on the brackets at the desired heights. If such a vertical height adjustment mechanism were used, it might be desirable to include a plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> at different heights to accommodate wires at different heights. It also might be aesthetically desirable to include means for concealing such wires from being seen through apertures positioned above the aperture being used, such as by providing a channel along the side of main panel for threading the wires, or other means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Another possible manner of implementing a limited form of vertical adjustability for support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. Video camera support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime; depicted in these figures is adapted to have its height adjusted during its installation or during the installation of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Once adjusted, the height can thereafter not be lengthened, but only shortened. This limited form of vertical adjustability is accomplished by way of a series of horizontal score lines <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> defined on the back of main panel <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>&prime;. These score lines allow an installer or other person to easily cut main panel <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>&prime; along a selected score line corresponding to the desired height of support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime;. The cutting of the score line is accomplished by first removing a detachable mount <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Detachable mount <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> includes hook <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>&prime; and a pair of sidewalls <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. After detachable mount <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> has been removed, access to any of score lines <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is obtained and the cutting can take place. After the cutting has been completed, detachable mount <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is re-attached to support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime; by way of nuts and bolts or other fasteners inserted through the two lowermost holes in a set of holes <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> defined in sidewalls <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. These fasteners also fit through two holes defined at the top of non-detachable sidewalls <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>&prime; to thereby secure detachable mount <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to the rest of support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime;. Thereafter, support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime; is hung via hook <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>&prime; over the top edge <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. If the height of support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime; is later desired to be reduced even further, the above-described process can be repeated. It will be understood the manners of adjusting the height of support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>&prime; are intended herein to only be illustrative, and that the present invention encompasses other types of vertical adjustability for support <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A number of variations can be made to the media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as described above without departing from the invention. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the height of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be varied as desired, although media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> preferably has a height of at least five feet, although lesser heights can be used. The width of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can also be varied as desired. More than one television can also be supported on a media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>&prime;, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, as well as more than one video camera support <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. In some instances, it may be desirable to support up to four or more televisions on the media wall. Further modifications to media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> include using shapes other than rectangular or square for main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>; positioning shelves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> at different locations; removing one or both of shelves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>; reshaping shelves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>; removing, reshaping, or rearranging drawers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>; and repositioning the location of connection panels <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. This list of possible modifications is only intended to be illustrative, and many further variations of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are also contemplated within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> To install and use media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, it is first brought to a desired location in a building, home, or other structure. Stationary support <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is then secured to the floor and the wall via mounting plates <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and top support <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In some instances, it may not be necessary to include top support <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, depending on the weight and size of the particular media wall being used, as well as the sturdiness of the floor to which mounting plates <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are secured. In such instances, whatever connections that are needed to firmly secure media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are made, and it is to be understood that the use of supports other than support <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is contemplated within the invention. Support <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be installed while main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is attached, or it may be installed separately from main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. If done separately, main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is then attached to support <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by connecting frame <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and support <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> together via one or more hinges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> After support <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> have been firmly secured, main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is pivoted away from any adjacent structural wall, to the extent it hasn&prime;t already been so pivoted during the installation process. This pivoting allows access to the rear face <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. One or more electronic devices may then be placed on shelves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. If no apertures <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are provided in main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, these can be drilled at the desired location or locations on main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in order to accommodate wires from the plasma screen television, or other display device. The television or televisions can then be mounted using a conventional mount to the front face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. A video camera may further be placed on video camera support <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. After all the desired electronic devices are positioned on media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, their respective power cords can be plugged into one or more of the power outlets <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> positioned on the back of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The video output <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of video switcher <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is then connected by an appropriate cable to the plasma screen television in order to allow the television to display any video signals being transmitted through video jacks <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. If DVD players or VCRs are positioned on shelves <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, these can also be connected via appropriate cables to allow the television to display these signals. These connections are easily accomplished by a person standing behind media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> because the entire back panel of these devices is easily accessible via the pivoting of panel <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. A video cable may further be installed between the video camera and the television to allow the television to display what the camera is viewing. Such a connection is preferably made by running the cable behind support <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, over the top edge <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and down through aperture <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> into the back of the television in order to ensure that the cable connection is not visible. After all desired cable connections have been made, the power, phone, and network plugs <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are inserted into corresponding jacks in an adjacent structural wall. Preferably, although not necessarily, media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is chosen to be installed in a location where at least one adjacent power outlet is available, as well as a phone jack and one or more network jacks. If such outlets and jacks are not located near enough to media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such that they will be concealed from view when main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is pivoted to a closed position, then it may be necessary to run extension cords or wires to insert plugs <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> into the appropriate outlets or jacks. Such extensions are, of course, not aesthetically desirable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> After installation of the wires and cables is complete, main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is pivoted to a closed position (i.e. it is pivoted up against a structural wall). The pivoting of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is facilitated by one or more wheels (not shown) positioned on the bottom of main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on a side opposite pivot axis <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Such wheels can be made from any suitable material and can take a wide variety of designs. Preferably such wheels include a sufficient amount of surface area such that they do not leave a permanent or undue mark on the floor after main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has been pivoted, even after repeated pivotings. After main wall <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has been closed, media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is ready for use. In addition to the normal operation of all the electronic devices supported on media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, further electronic devices may be connected to media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> cart <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is positioned adjacent media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Cart <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> may be used by a person giving a presentation to people in the room in which media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is located. If the person has a computer, such as a laptop, positioned on the cart, this computer can be connected to one of connection panels <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> on media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Such connections can include power, network, phone, or video connections. By using the video connection, it is possible for the user of the computer to transmit images on his or her computer to the television mounted on front face <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Because connection panels <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are preferably included on both sidewalls <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the person giving the presentation has the freedom of working on either side of media wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, two individuals can simultaneously access connections panels <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to further enhance the presentation options. </paragraph>
