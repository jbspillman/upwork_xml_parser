<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an automatic domestic trash delivery system extending between chosen refuse container storage and designated pick-up site. This invention is to provide a domestic refuse delivery system that can be emptied by garbage pick-up service, more specifically the trucks with the automatic lift and dump apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In Ullrich, U.S. Pat. No. 5,042,642, for a household trash delivery system on a track, in which the cart is moved by continuous chain conveyor. Another system is described in Putnam, U.S. Pat. No. 5,353,887 in which the motor is housed in the cart and has a drive wheel located on the under side of the cart drivable on a track at set times using a programmable timer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The disadvantages of the prior art for track mounted vehicles, is that vehicles do not have the support necessary for the impact of the automatic lift apparatuses which are applied to the collection vehicles to assist the collection process. Prior art of the Ullrich and Putnam patents show complex installation of the track which is a burden to the marketability. Further more, the Putnam patent provides an impractical method to overcome snow, where if the level of snow were to accumulate higher than a small mound in a short period of time, the cart would be inoperative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another drawback of the prior art is when the owner could be vacant from the home for any amount of time and the carrier takes the container to the curbside empty causing the collection vehicle to assume there is garbage in the barrel and accumulating time, they are giving effort to save, with the new automatic lifts. </paragraph>
