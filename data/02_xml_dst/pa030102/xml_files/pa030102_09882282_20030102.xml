<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Disclosed is a computer-implemented method for maintaining a business relationship between a seller (i.e., a first entity) and a buyer (i.e. a second entity). The method includes the steps of: a) providing a central database of information that contains disparate buyer data on a first entity network; b) establishing a buyer access level function on a first entity network, wherein the buyer level function allows the first entity to provide a buyer with access to a set of buyer data and a set of buyer functions for structuring the set of buyer data; c) establishing a gatekeeper level function that provides access at a gatekeeper buyer contact point on a buyer network to the set of buyer data from the database and the set of buyer functions; and d) establishing a buyer subordinate level user function at a buyer subordinate level user contact point that provides a buyer subordinate level user with access to selected buyer data from the set of buyer data and selected functions from the selected buyer functions at the buyer subordinate level user contact point. Also disclosed is an apparatus that is capable of performing this method. </paragraph>

<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to business relationship methods, and, in particular, to a computer-implemented automated system for maintaining a business relationship between a seller and a buyer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Automated systems for maintaining and developing the relationship between a seller and a buyer are increasing in importance in the present economy. As technology develops, computer-implemented systems are required to define these relationships, especially between a seller and multiple buyers. With increased options available to a buyer of goods and services, increased value is placed on a full-service, flexible and customer-oriented system. Such a system will assist in defining, maintaining and developing the relationship between the seller and the buyers. Further, the more user-specific the system, the more the individual user values and utilizes the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Such a user-tuned or user-specific system is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,195,651 to Handel et al. The &apos;651 patent discloses a system that provides a web-based user interface to a user based upon the user&apos;s profile information. The system of the &apos;651 patent uses a pattern matching routine to process and match web-based content and present this content in a user-specific fashion. However, the system of the &apos;651 patent lacks the ability to ensure that a user will view the precise information that he or she wishes to view. In addition, the &apos;651 system does not allow the user to dynamically adjust and modify the type and format of data that he or she wishes to view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another example of a system that defines a relationship between trading partners is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,226,675 to Meltzer et al. The &apos;675 patent discloses a participant server which processes documents in commerce in and between trading partner networks. Using business interface definitions, trading partners can place orders and check status and inventory levels. While the system of the &apos;675 patent facilitates the information exchange between a buyer and a seller, such a system lacks the dynamic adjustability and customizable presentation of information required for specifically meeting any individual customer&apos;s needs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,182,142 to Win et al. is directed to distributed access management of information resources. The system of the &apos;142 patent controls information resources, allowing an individual user access to only authorized resources and data. The access privilege and level of the user depends upon his or her role and/or functional grouping. Using encrypted tokens that define the user&apos;s role and functional grouping, the system stores the tokens and presents the user with a customized display, showing only those resources or data to which the user has authorized access. While the system of the &apos;142 patent presents customized information based on the user access level, this system lacks the dynamic adjustment at the user or customer interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,226,656 to Zawadzski et al. discloses a system for creating, generating and processing user-defined generic specs. The system of the &apos;656 patent allows users to access a central database of information via the Internet, and uses a page builder to build and present a custom page to the user via a web browser. The display of the page depends upon the user&apos;s answers to questions and selections. A customized output of information is provided to the user wherein the system sets flags and turns options on and off depending upon the user&apos;s answers and selections. The system of the &apos;656 patent is limited in use and only provides predetermined product information to the user in a customer-chosen format. The customer is limited in access, and the system is not dynamic at its root. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The prior art lacks the ability to present disparate customer data in a truly dynamic fashion. Also lacking is the ability to delegate individual user access designation to the customer or buyer side, which is required for a fully functional and customizable networked system. Each individual user dynamic functionality and authorized access level should be prescribed at the buyer end, and the buyer itself must also have seller-authorized access. In addition, there remains a need for not only dynamic customizability on the buyer end, but this dynamic customizability must provide information that is, itself, dynamic. Further, each individual user should be able to customize his or her authorized data in a customizable format to his or her choosing. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a system that can present disparate buyer data to an authorized buyer. It is another object of the present invention to provide a system that provides a framework for dynamically structuring form and content of data. It is another object of the present invention to provide a system that delegates, at the customer end, the ability for the buyer to determine each individual user&apos;s dynamic functionality and individual authorized access level. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a system that allows access and customization at the user end to information that is likewise dynamic. It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a system which allows the individual user to select the data and presentation of the data in a fully customizable fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in order to overcome the deficiencies of the prior art, we have invented a computer-implemented automated system for maintaining a business relationship between a seller (i.e., a first entity) and at least one buyer (i.e., a second entity). According to the present invention, there is provided a method and apparatus for an automated system for maintaining a business relationship between a seller and a buyer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A method according to the present invention includes the steps of: (a) providing a database of information that contains disparate buyer data on a seller network; (b) establishing a buyer access level function on a seller network, wherein the buyer access level function allows the seller to provide a buyer with access to a set of buyer data from the database and a set of buyer functions for structuring the set of buyer data; (c) establishing a gatekeeper level function that allows the provision of a gatekeeper buyer contact point on a buyer network with the set of buyer data from the database and the set of buyer functions; and (d) establishing a buyer subordinate level user function that allows the provision of a buyer subordinate level user contact point that provides a buyer subordinate level user with access to selected buyer data from the set of buyer data and selected functions from the set of buyer functions at the buyer subordinate level user contact point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> We have also developed an apparatus that is capable of performing the above-described method. The present invention, both as to its construction and its method of operation, together with the additional objects and advantages thereof, will best be understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an automated interface tool for managing the functional relationships between a seller and a buyer, and a buyer&apos;s access to buyer information on a seller network, as well as access and functionality of individual users on a buyer&apos;s network. The present invention is useful in both the macro-management and the micro-management of buyer data, down to the granularity of singular data fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> This method presents an automated system for maintaining a business relationship between a seller and a buyer. Initially, while the terms &ldquo;seller&rdquo; and &ldquo;buyer&rdquo; are used, these terms are envisioned to include any relationship where the parties engage in the transactional exchange of information. For example, the &ldquo;seller&rdquo; may also be termed as a provider of a large data warehouse of information, which includes data that is specific to the second party. Therefore, a &ldquo;seller&rdquo; may be a corporate entity, an employer, an affiliate, a seller agent, etc. Similarly, the &ldquo;buyer&rdquo; may be a corporate entity, an employee, a subsidiary, a buyer agent, a user, an administrator, etc. A key factor of the relationship between the parties is defined by the collection, retention and dispensation of a database of information by the seller, and the administration, authorization, and presentation of some or all of the information to the buyer. The present method is equally useful for a first entity and a second entity engaging in some transactional exchange of information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating the method according to the present invention, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a system according to the method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a first step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> provides a database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of information that contains disparate buyer data <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and resides on a seller network <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> resides on the seller network <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and it is maintained in a secured environment, ultimately only modifiable by the seller or seller agent. This secured environment is typically maintained through the use of a firewall <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. The central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is a vast collection of information, including seller-specific data <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and files, together with buyer-specific data <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and information. The buyer-specific data <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> includes all buyer and customer information relating to the relationship and transactional occurrences between the seller and the buyer, e.g., data pertaining to contracts, contacts, sales, shipping, inventory, Certificates of Analysis, logistical tracking, invoices, order history, etc. The seller network <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> may provide information from a variety of sources and networks, e.g., connected third party networks, common access networks and other data source networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Also included in the central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is seller information <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight> that may be of interest to the buyer for tracking and other informational purposes, e.g., seller inventory levels, product availability, Material Safety Data Sheets, etc. This central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is resident on the seller network <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, which includes multiple data feeds, multiple databases, multiple seller-affiliated sub-networks and multiple operating platforms (e.g., Microsoft Windows, Unix, etc).(collectively referred to by reference number <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>), all accessible by and in communication with the central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a set of Oracle&reg; tables, which use a foreign key infrastructure (or other relational database structure) to correctly store and associate each individual data field, and each linked group of data fields. While Oracle&reg;-type data association is preferred, any database organizational structure platform is envisioned. At a base level, a key requirement is that the central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be parsed for the buyer-specific information <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, i.e., information that is associated or linked to the buyer, and can also be parsed for buyer-authorized seller information <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>, i.e., information to which the seller wishes to grant the buyer access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The disparate buyer data <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may include multiple customers, multiple product lines and multiple products. This data <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is unrelated, except for its links to the specific buyer, and housed in the many databases and networks that feed and create the central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> on the seller network <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. It is envisioned that this central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be truly dynamic, offering the buyer real-time access to the buyer-specific data <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and buyer-authorized seller data <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. While this may be useful in some instances, e.g., Certificates of Analysis, it may be inefficient to provide such dynamic access for all of the data, e.g., current buyer ship-to contact information. In choosing which data should be updated and maintained on the central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in a dynamic relationship with the buyer, the seller must take into account the operable inefficiencies and resulting data bottle-necks that may occur with such flexibility. Therefore, while it is certainly envisioned that all data is offered to the buyer in real-time, it is preferred to &ldquo;update&rdquo; relatively static information on a more periodic basis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In a second step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a buyer access level function is established, typically on the seller network <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. In establishing the buyer access level function, a seller is allowed to provide a buyer with access to a set of buyer data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> (containing the buyer-specific data <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the buyer-authorized seller data <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>) from the central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Further, in this step <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the seller is allowed to provide a buyer with access to a set of buyer functions for structuring the set of buyer data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. Importantly, while the set of buyer data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> may contain all data on the seller network <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> that is related to the buyer, it may be limited by the seller to only the specific buyer data deemed useful to the buyer. For example, it would be both non-useful and an inefficient use of central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> space and structure to provide the buyer with access to exceedingly outdated data. However, if the buyer wished to have access to this information, to the extent it was still available somewhere in the seller network <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the seller could &ldquo;call&rdquo; the information to the central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and make the information available to the buyer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The buyer level access function provides a portal for the customer, e.g., the buyer corporate entity, affiliated user groups, multiple users. This portal has a defined identity, which is defined by the access level. Overall, the buyer level access function is the ability of the seller to associate and provide the set of buyer data to the buyer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The set of buyer data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and the set of buyer functions is determined by the seller, but is not pre-determined. This set of buyer data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and set of buyer functions is dynamically adjustable by the seller, and requires neither specialized nor technical knowledge for modification or revocation. In doing so, the present method is particularly useful in a large corporate seller network <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, where an administrator can modify the set of buyer data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and set of buyer functions at his or her terminal, without the need to &ldquo;program&rdquo; or &ldquo;code&rdquo; in the classic sense. This, in turn, creates a flexible, useful and dynamic functional aspect to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The set of buyer functions is the functionality required to define and maintain a transactional relationship between a seller and a buyer. For example, one of the functions available with the set of buyer functions is the ability to define the format in which the buyer would like the set of buyer information presented. These buyer functions give the buyer the functional capability to arrange, add, remove, organize and present buyer data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> in any form that the buyer wishes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The next step, step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, includes establishing a gatekeeper level function that allows the provision of a gatekeeper buyer contact point <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> on a buyer network <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. This gatekeeper level function allows the gatekeeper buyer contact point <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> access to the set of buyer data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and the set of buyer functions. In essence, the &ldquo;gatekeeper&rdquo; and the gatekeeper level function is the provision of authorization, definition and access to the set of buyer data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and the set of buyer functions, as allowed by the seller. The provision of the gatekeeper level function may occur on the seller network <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> or on the buyer network <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, as long as the functional aspect of the gatekeeper is provided to and limited to the buyer network <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. While multiple gatekeeper buyer contact points <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be created, it is typically not preferable to provide such system administrator status to more than one gatekeeper buyer contact point <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> for integrity management reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Step <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be thought of as the seller providing top-level or system administrator access to the buyer as to the set of buyer data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and set of buyer functions. Since the gatekeeper level function is typically provided by the seller, the gatekeeper is limited in scope, access and authority to the levels and data as established by the seller. This prevents the gatekeeper from accessing data or functionality that the seller deems to be outside of his or her scope or authority. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Finally, step <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> entails establishing a buyer subordinate level user function that allows the provision of a buyer subordinate level user contact point <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. This buyer subordinate level user contact point <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> provides a buyer subordinate level user with access to selected buyer data <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, as selected from the set of buyer data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, and selected buyer functions, as selected from the set of buyer functions. Both the selected buyer data <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and selected buyer functions are provided at the buyer subordinate level user contact point <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Either the seller or the gatekeeper may provide a buyer subordinate level user contact point <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the gatekeeper provides the buyer subordinate level user contact point <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. This allows the buyer, through the buyer gatekeeper, to manage the flow and distribution of buyer data to each individual buyer user. For example, the buyer may wish each salesperson to have access to the sales data, but not the financial accounting data. Therefore, the buyer gatekeeper can restrict access at the buyer subordinate level user contact point <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> according to each user&apos;s role and responsibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It is envisioned that either the gatekeeper or the seller may provide a plurality of subordinate level user contact points <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the gatekeeper can manage multiple users, and define their flow of information, access to buyer data and interrelationships. Further, it may be useful to establish &ldquo;groups&rdquo; of users, e.g., the sales group, the accounting group, the shipping group, etc. Each individual user may have the same access to the selected buyer data <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and selected buyer functions at different buyer subordinate level user contact points <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. The present method allows the buyer to establish and manage groups of users, assign project groups, define access levels and permit individualized functionality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> At the first (or subsequent) buyer subordinate level user contact point <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, each individual user has a defined, yet versatile, set of selected buyer functions, which the individual user may use to organize, manage and present the selected buyer data <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. For example, if a user in the laboratory would like to view a report matching the Certificate of Analysis for a product to a specific product shipment, that user is able to select the appropriate data fields and dynamically access the buyer data required to view such a report. Importantly, the user-selected data for the report must be a subset of the selected buyer data <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> which the individual user has permission to view. Further, the selected buyer data <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is a subset of the set of buyer data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, as determined by the gatekeeper or seller, and, in turn, the set of buyer data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is a subset of the central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of information. The present method is advantageous in that, if the gatekeeper would like to revoke, modify or expand access for an individual user, he or she may do so on the buyer network <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, with little or no need for technical support from the seller. This functionality drastically increases the versatility of the system, and its usefulness to the buyer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> If authorization and permission is present, an individual user has total control over the customization and presentation of the selected buyer data <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. One particular advantage of the present invention is the dynamic nature of the disparate buyer data <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, the individual user, to the extent authorized, has access to the selected buyer data <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> directly at the central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> on the seller network. This allows the user to dynamically track any number of data streams and follow any data modifications. For example, this dynamic data access would allow a user in a shipping/receiving department to track an incoming shipment from the seller, thereby allowing the user to more effectively logistically manage and prepare for the shipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> This same method is employed with multiple buyers, typically business entities. Since the central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is maintained on the seller network <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, all buyer-specific data <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is secure from access by other buyers (and competitors). Further, maintenance of the central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> on the seller network <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> still allows for the seller to manage all buyer data <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the method is the ability of the individual user to restrict or filter his or her own access or function. This allows the user to select subsets of the selected buyer data <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. While the individual user may further restrict his or her access to the selected buyer data <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, the user is not authorized to &ldquo;expand&rdquo; his or her access beyond the selected buyer data <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and selected buyer functions, as set by the gatekeeper. Similarly, this is equally applicable to the gatekeeper, who can limit, but cannot expand access beyond the set of buyer data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and set of buyer functions, as set by the seller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Customer modifications and additions can be made quickly and efficiently in the present system. Whereas, in the prior art, making a customer modification or addition to a large networked system of this type may take days or weeks, and require considerable additional coding, making such changes or modifications in the present system takes minutes. This quickness evolves from the simple and dynamic nature of the present invention, together with the lack of a requirement of a &ldquo;technical&rdquo; or &ldquo;programming&rdquo; background. Overall, the present system provides a dynamic control for tracking customer changes between the actual business relationship and the virtual business relationship. This control maintains 100% integrity between the actual business relationship and its virtual reflection. Further, this control provides the necessary flexibility for event modification and the transition between the actual and virtual business relationship. As discussed above, the central database <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> contains predetermined seller-specific data <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and buyer-specific data <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. The buyer-specific data <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is information relating to the relationship and transactional occurrences between the seller and the buyer thereby defining an event between the seller and the buyer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In a particularly advantageous manner, the present invention provides a feature referred to as &ldquo;relationship framework functionality.&rdquo; This relationship framework functionality is a particularly advantageous way for allowing the seller to provide the buyer with access to the set of buyer data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and the set of buyer functions for structuring the set of buyer data <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. The relationship framework functionality generally includes: (1) a report relationship structure module field that defines generic features of events that are expected to occur in a relationship between a buyer and a seller; and (2) at least one database, electronically connected to the report relationship structure module field, that provides content for defining specific features of a specific event that actually occurs between a buyer and seller. The report relationship structure module field can define any generic feature or features of the events that are expected to occur during the course of the buyer-seller relationship. The at least one database electronically connected to the report relationship structure module field can include any database that can provide content for events that occur between the buyer and the seller. The report relationship structure module field interacts with the corresponding database or databases and generates reports that document events that occur in the relationship of the buyer and the seller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In use, when the buyer access level function is established on a seller network, the buyer level function allows the seller to provide a buyer with access to reports, generated by the relationship framework functionality. These reports conveniently summarize events that occur in the buyer-seller relationship. In turn, the corresponding gatekeeper level function provides access at a gatekeeper buyer contact point <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> on the buyer network <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to the reports that are generated by the relationship framework functionality. Further, the buyer subordinate level user function at the buyer subordinate user contact point <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> can provide a buyer subordinate level user with access to the reports generated by the relationship framework functionality. In view of the buyer having access to such reports, a buyer can now easily keep track of events that actually occur in a buyer-seller relationship. Also, since the relationship framework functionality can be modified to accommodate changes in a buyer-seller business relationship, a buyer can now easily keep track of changes that actually occur in a buyer-seller relationship. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, events that occur in the actual business relationship are reflected in the virtual business relationship via the method of the present invention. However, the present system further allows for the dynamic presentation of selectable data to the buyer through the relationship framework functionality. As opposed to offering static disparate buyer data <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to the buyer in a rigid format, the relationship framework functionality allows the system to reflect events that occur in the actual business relationship in the virtual business relationship, together with the ability to present the event data in selectable, dynamic fashion. For example, truly flexible and dynamic reporting occurs under this functionality, and the reports or data presentations are easily created without additional coding. This functionality allows an event to be created and defined between the seller and the buyer. Corresponding selected buyer data <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> for defining the event is selected and formatted in a presentable report, for presentation to the buyer. Either the seller or the buyer can define the event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It is this relationship framework functionality that deconstructs the prior art data presentation systems. This deconstruction occurs between the format and the presentable data. Typically, a data presentation system will allow a user to &ldquo;select&rdquo; from a rigid or static set of form reports. The functionality of the present system tracks and provides only authorized data to a user in a fully-customizable format. As opposed to requiring a customer to send a request for a new report to a programmer, and a programmer creating the report, the present system automatically receives the customer request, filters the data (for authorization), allows the seller to construct a customized report format based on the authorized data, and presents the customized report to the customer. The relationship framework functionality allows a non-technical person to easily construct this customized report without any additional coding. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 1 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In a specific example of the method according to the present invention, S Corp. is the seller and B Corp. is the buyer. S Corp. maintains, on its network, a large database of information containing disparate buyer data, including buyer data specifically concerning B. Corp. The S Corp. network has multiple data feeds and is an affiliation of many S Corp sub-networks. One of the S Corp. sub-networks is the S Corp. Plant network, located across the country from the S Corp. headquarter location, where the central database resides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> B Corp. has decided continue its use of S Corp. since S Corp. provides dynamic accessibility to B Corp. buyer data. At this point, S Corp., typically an S Corp. employee, such as a system administrator, establishes a B Corp. access level function, allowing the system administrator to provide B Corp. with access to a set of B Corp. data and a set of B Corp. functions. Since B Corp. is a long-time customer of S Corp., the system administrator decides to limit the set of B Corp. data to the last ten years of collected B Corp. data. The system administrator also provides B Corp. with a set of B Corp. functions, which allow B Corp. to structure, choose, manipulate and present the B Corp. data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Next, the S Corp. system administrator establishes a gatekeeper level function, either on the S Corp. network or the B Corp. network. This gatekeeper level function allows B Corp., again, typically the B Corp. system administrator, access at a gatekeeper B Corp. contact point on the B Corp. network. Additionally, this gatekeeper level function provides the B Corp. system administrator access to the B Corp. data and B Corp. functions, as decided and established by the S Corp. system administrator. For security and accountability reasons, B Corp. has requested that only one person (or role) be appointed as the gatekeeper, although, if chosen, multiple gatekeepers may be appointed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The B Corp. system administrator, as the gatekeeper, then establishes, on the B Corp. network, multiple B Corp. subordinate level user functions at corresponding B Corp. subordinate level user contact points, typically the user&apos;s computer access points. The gatekeeper provides, at these contact points, access to selected B Corp. data, as selected from the set of B Corp. data, and to selected B Corp. functions, again as selected from the set of B Corp. functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The B Corp. system administrator decides to provide the manager of shipping and receiving access to both the B Corp. shipping data and the B Corp. Certificates of Analysis for each shipment. Since the manager of shipping and receiving has minimal need for any financial data, the B Corp. system administrator decides to permit no access to the manager for this financial data. Therefore, the shipping data and the Certificates of Analysis are the selected data to which the manager has access to at his or her contact point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As the manager is expecting a shipment from S Corp., and would like to view the Certificate of Analysis for the product being shipped, the manager decides to access the S Corp. system at the manager&apos;s contact point. The manager logs on to his or her computer and access his or her S Corp. web page. Since the gatekeeper has limited the manager&apos;s data access and functionality, the manager only views on the S Corp. web page that data and function to which he or she has access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The manager &ldquo;runs&rdquo; a report listing all incoming S Corp. shipments, including the &ldquo;ship to&rdquo;, &ldquo;product&rdquo;, &ldquo;expected arrival date&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Certificate of Analysis for the product&rdquo; fields. This report or call is routed through the B Corp. network, to the S Corp. network, and draws information from the central database on the S Corp. network. While the &ldquo;ship to&rdquo; B Corp. data is updated on a weekly basis, the &ldquo;product&rdquo;, &ldquo;expected arrival date&rdquo; and &ldquo;Certificate of Analysis&rdquo; data is updated and dynamically available to B Corp. on an hourly basis. The appropriate data is searched, linked and routed to the manager&apos;s computer, thereby providing the manager with up-to-date and accurate information on any S Corp. shipment. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE 3 </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0439" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0439&rsqb;</number> Another example of the method according to the present invention is presented, demonstrating the relationship framework functionality as directed to master and customer reporting and further benefits resulting from the computer-implemented method of the present invention. Screen shots and field charts of this example embodiment are illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0440" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0440&rsqb;</number> Create a Master Report </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0441" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0441&rsqb;</number> From the SecureNET header click on CUSTOM/BayerONE/Master Reports. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0442" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0442&rsqb;</number> Click on the New report button. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</cross-reference>. This will take you to the main Master Report configuration page. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</cross-reference>. If you wish to edit a report, click on the report name link. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0443" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0443&rsqb;</number> Name and Description: This is the name and description of the Master Report that will be used within SecureNET and is not visible in the BayerONE application. The Master Report name is used as the template report for a Custom Report (discussed and described in detail below). This is also the name shown when publishing function codes to customers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0444" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0444&rsqb;</number> Drill Down Report: Sets the function code as a drill down report. Will not appear on a desktop and cannot be customized. This report will always be called from another report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0445" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0445&rsqb;</number> Function Code: The function code is used behind the scenes and determines which reports get published. If a certain Master Report is published, then all Custom Reports using that Master Report get published as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0446" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0446&rsqb;</number> Function Code Description: Adds more description to the function code. This is the text that appears when publishing a Master Report to a desktop and also on the customer profile definition page. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0447" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0447&rsqb;</number> Select Distinct: When checked adds a DISTINCT to the SELECT clause. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0448" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0448&rsqb;</number> Group By: When checked, creates a GROUP BY clause using the fields, in the same order, from the SELECT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0449" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0449&rsqb;</number> Use Location: When checked, the security code is tacked onto the end of the WHERE clause, filtering the results by security. This also tacks on the bill to ship to combinations the user might have selected on their preference page in BayerONE </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0450" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0450&rsqb;</number> Example: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0451" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0451&rsqb;</number> AND aa.billto_shipto_compkey in (003804590012097001, 00340890098549001) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0452" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0452&rsqb;</number> When using the security code, the primary table doing the security must be aliased AA in the FROM clause. So in the above example, the billto shipto compkey is located in CHEMSALES.ORDERS_BS </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0453" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0453&rsqb;</number> FROM CHEMSALES.ORDERS_BS AA </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0454" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0454&rsqb;</number> Use Families: When checked, the report is filtered by the customer&apos;s product families. This additional SQL will be tacked onto the end of the WHERE clause. This also tacks on the products the user might have selected to view on their preference page in BayerONE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0455" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0455&rsqb;</number> Example: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0456" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0456&rsqb;</number> AND (aa.product_family_code &equals;001 OR aa_product_family_code&equals;002) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0457" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0457&rsqb;</number> When using the product family code, the table that contains the column you wish to use the product family code against must be aliased AA in the FROM clause. So in the above example, the product family code is located in CHEMSALES.ORDERS_BS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0458" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0458&rsqb;</number> FROM CHEMSALES.ORDERS_BS AA </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0459" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0459&rsqb;</number> Required Fields: Can be used for any field in the SELECT portion of the SQL statement. All fields in the required field section will be tacked onto the end of the SELECT clause. These fields are not aliased, as the MasterReport fields are aliased when the report is generated. These fields will not be available when creating a custom report and will not be visible to the report when published on the desktop. Required fields must also be included in the Master Report Fields if you wish to display or use them as search fields in the report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0460" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0460&rsqb;</number> Required fields are used primarily as substitution fields when linking reports. See the section on Link Fields. Even if a field, that will be used as a substitution field, is already included as a Master Report field, and since Master Report fields are aliased when the report is generated in BayerONE (field0, field1, field2) based on their display order, and this order may possibly change, a required field is used. These fields may be aliased, and if aliased, the alias should be used in the substitution field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0461" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0461&rsqb;</number> From Clause: Where all the table names used in the SQL statement should be entered. FROM keyword should not be used, the reporting module takes care of adding it. The tables in the FROM clause should be comma delimited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0462" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0462&rsqb;</number> Table Joins: This is the WHERE clause. The keyword WHERE should not be used, the reporting module takes care of it. This section should include all static SQL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0463" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0463&rsqb;</number> Examples of a valid statement is: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0464" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0464&rsqb;</number> AA.SHIPTO_CUST_LOC&equals;CST.SHIPTO_CUST_LOC </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0465" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0465&rsqb;</number> AND AA.ORDER_LINE_TYPE_CODE&lt;&equals;&lsquo;02&rsquo;</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0468" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0468&rsqb;</number> Order By: The order by appends an ORDER BY clause to the end of the SQL statement. Since fields will be aliased in the reporting module when the report is generated, and users may choose to customize their reports, numbers representing the order of the columns in the SELECT clause are used in the ORDER BY. In the Master Report section there must always at least be a 1 entered in this field. If an ORDER BY is not in the Custom Report this will keep the report on BayerONE from malfunctioning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0469" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0469&rsqb;</number> When finished with the main Master Report Page, click on the Save Changes button to save all the information just entered. After this is done for the first time, for a particular Master Report, the buttons at the top of the frame change. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0470" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0470&rsqb;</number> Save Changes: Saves all changes made on the Master Report main page. Clicking this button will not save any other changes made on any other page, including the Modify Fields and Modify Totals pages. They have their own save buttons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0471" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0471&rsqb;</number> Modify fields: Takes you to the Master Report Fields page where new fields can be added by clicking on the new field link above the header. Already existing fields may be edited as well. This is done by clicking on the Edit link. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0472" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0472&rsqb;</number> Modify Totals: Directs to the Master Report Totals page </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0473" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0473&rsqb;</number> Move to Production: Currently not in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0474" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0474&rsqb;</number> Delete: Deletes the Master Report and all Custom Reports associated with it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0475" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0475&rsqb;</number> Copy Report: Currently not in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0476" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0476&rsqb;</number> Transfer Report: Currently not in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0477" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0477&rsqb;</number> The Master Report field form is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0478" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0478&rsqb;</number> Display Name: The display name is used as the column header within the BayerONE report and will be displayed to BayerONE users as a column header. It is also used to refer to this field in the Custom Report module of SecureNET. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0479" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0479&rsqb;</number> Order: The order in which the columns will appear when creating/editing Custom reports within SecureNET. It gives a starting point for column ordering when creating a Custom report. It is recommended to place display fields first and non-display fields last. The Custom Report will override any order settings when generating the report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0480" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0480&rsqb;</number> Display Type: Display type is primarily utilized when a field is a Search Field (when the Search Field checkbox is checked in the section below). If the field is not a search field, it must be set to Edit. The display type selected determines the output of the input fields on the search screen for any Custom Report using this particular Master Report in BayerONE. The following is a description of all the options in the dropdown for the display type and how they will behave when generated in the search page of BayerONE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0481" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0481&rsqb;</number> Edit: An alphanumeric free form edit field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0482" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0482&rsqb;</number> Check: Not implemented yet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0483" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0483&rsqb;</number> Choice: Not implemented yet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0484" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0484&rsqb;</number> Date: Supplies a calendar object for the user to select a full date. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0485" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0485&rsqb;</number> Month: Gives the user a dropdown list of all month year combinations for the past two years. (11-00, 12-00, 01-01, 02-01) are examples of the format presented on the Search Page to the BayerONE user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0486" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0486&rsqb;</number> Select: Provides a selection list to the user on the Search Page, but also allows the user to edit the field. Places an image to the right of the field which pops up a list of valid values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0487" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0487&rsqb;</number> Unknown: Any field configured this way will display ERROR for its value and in certain places other messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0488" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0488&rsqb;</number> Size: The HTML size of the Display type field on the Search Page of the BayerONE application. &lt;input type&equals;&lsquo;edit&rsquo; size&equals;25&gt;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0489" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0489&rsqb;</number> Function Code: The only function code valid for this field located in the dropdown are ones preceded by (C). Currently there is only one report pricing (REPORTPRICING). The function codes for columns are defined in the database only and currently there is no other way to define them. When a function code is chosen it restricts, on a line-by-line basis, whether that column is displayed to the user or not. The only example is with pricing, and it restricts based on security. If a customer has an order shipped to them but does not pay for it, another company paid for it and got special pricing, this information should not be displayed. Only the customer who paid for it should see the price, because of pricing issues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0490" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0490&rsqb;</number> Sortable: If checked, allows the user of BayerONE to sort the report on that column. Two little arrows are shown to the left of the column header in the BayerONE report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0491" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0491&rsqb;</number> Search Field: Allows a field to be on the report&apos;s Search Page and will allow a user of BayerONE to limit the report. A report can have zero, one, or multiple columns as search fields. Making a field a search field in a Master Report allows the field to be a search field in any Custom Reports created from it. Checking this option only makes this field available as a search field. This is setting the field type. The fields display Type determines its format on the search page. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0492" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0492&rsqb;</number> Display Field: If checked, makes a field available for display on any BayerONE report using this Master Report. This can be overridden from the Custom Reporting module </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0493" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0493&rsqb;</number> Required: When checked, indicates this field is required for the query, regardless of whether it is displayed on the report or not. If there is a chance a field is needed and that field could be removed from display, either in the Custom Reporting module or if a customer were to customize their report on their desktop and the field may be removed, then check the required field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0494" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0494&rsqb;</number> Header Field: A field that has header field checked will be used as the report&apos;s primary sort, superseding any other sort order set in either the Master or Custom Reporting module. It will be used as a breaking header by the report in BayerONE . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0495" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0495&rsqb;</number> A header field requires the field SQL to be set to &lsquo;blank&rsquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0496" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0496&rsqb;</number> The SQL added in the Choice SQL section will appear as the text in the header. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0497" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0497&rsqb;</number> On the Modify Report Field page, where all the fields for the Master Report are displayed, any field selected as a header Field will be in bold text. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0498" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0498&rsqb;</number> An example of a Header field is in the Order History Detail report, the Address field, on the next page. In this example, the Ship To Address is used as a header field to split the data up by Ship to address. The address is listed in the header. The SQL to retrieve that text was added to the Choice SQL Section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0499" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0499&rsqb;</number> Totalable: If checked, will allow this field to be used as a total. This field must be a numeric field in the database. To create a totalable section at the bottom of the report, see the section on Totalable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0500" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0500&rsqb;</number> Total By: When checked, will allow this field to be totaled for the number of occurrences of data in this field. For example, showing the total dollar amount sold for each product. Please see the section on Totalable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0501" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0501&rsqb;</number> Link Field: Provides a link to another report document or e-mail. No column data is shown, only an icon. When the link field is checked, the Master Report Form Field page changes. Note some of the input fields on this page are different. There are several examples of link fields. Some of them are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0502" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0502&rsqb;</number> Link fields can also retrieve other documents (RetrieveDoc servlet) Currently, for a link field to retrieve a document, there must be specific code added to the RetrieveDoc servlet for those documents. Examples include COA, MSDS and PIB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0503" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0503&rsqb;</number> Link fields can also be used as links to send e-mail back to Bayer employees. To configure this, the E-mailRepForm servlet must be called and certain arguments are passes. An example is the Master Report Bayer Contact List, Send E-mail column. The arguments are the repE-mail, the e-mail address of the person to receive the e-mail, repFirstName, the first name of the person receiving the e-mail and repLastNam, the last name of the person receiving the e-mail. Please note the Link URL fields are case sensitive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0504" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0504&rsqb;</number> Example: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0505" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0505&rsqb;</number> /servlet/bayerone.feedback.E-mailRepForm&quest;repE-mail&equals;&lsqb;1&rsqb;&amp;repFirstName&equals;&lsqb;2&rsqb;&amp;repLastName&equals;&lsqb;3&rsqb;The &lsqb;1&rsqb;, &lsqb;2&rsqb; and &lsqb;3&rsqb; are referencing the subsitution fields, discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0506" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0506&rsqb;</number> A Master Report Field Form for Link Fields is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 60</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0507" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0507&rsqb;</number> To Make the Link Field Work: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0508" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0508&rsqb;</number> Field SQL should be filled out to be &lsquo;blank&rsquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0509" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0509&rsqb;</number> Doc.gif is the default icon. To use another icon, it must be sized correctly and placed at: /bayerone/images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0510" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0510&rsqb;</number> Please note the edit link button in the bottom right corner is another way to fill out link fields. It provides a different interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0511" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0511&rsqb;</number> Link URL field needs to be filled out. There are several steps necessary to correctly fill out this field. This is the URL used to generate the new report that is being linked with this report. It must be filled out in a way that the BuildReport servlet can interpret the URL and pick off the parameters necessary to generate the report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0512" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0512&rsqb;</number> First the path to the BuildReport servlet should be entered. Please note this section is case sensitive. It will always be: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0513" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0513&rsqb;</number> /servlet/BayerONE.report.BuildReport&quest;ReportId&equals;report id number </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0514" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0514&rsqb;</number> BuildReport is called to bypass the Search page (to get the search page call ExecuteReport). A report number specifies which report to run. Any argument that the report is expecting and that is needed to construct a call, exactly like a call to BuildReport servlet would appear coming from a search page in BayerONE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0515" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0515&rsqb;</number> report id number is the id number for the custom report that will be the linking report. This number may be obtained by going to the main custom report page and looking at the Attribs the first column on that page (see the Custom Reports picture and look at the column indicated by the number 1 arrow). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0516" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0516&rsqb;</number> If the link field requires parameters to provide limits or arguments to the linking report they must be passed following this pattern exactly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0517" lvl="4"><number>&lsqb;0517&rsqb;</number> Each parameter is delimited by a &amp;. A &amp; is not needed at the end of a link field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0518" lvl="4"><number>&lsqb;0518&rsqb;</number> The Identity parameter is a numerical comma delimited list of column numbers representing a column that will be used for comparison in the SQL statement of the linked report. Each column created in the Master Report has a column number, and this number must be used in the Identity. To determine the number of the column, go the Master Report Field page of the linked report. A list of all columns in that report is shown. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 61</cross-reference>. The field chosen for an Identity field must have a database column value in the Field SQL section of the Master Report Field Form page and not a blank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0519" lvl="5"><number>&lsqb;0519&rsqb;</number> The order of the column numbers listed for the Identity is important if more than one argument is to be passed. The first value in the comma delimited list will be compared with the first set of parameters and its values (compare0, field0 range0) and the second identity value will be compared with the second set of parameters and its values (compare1, field1 range1). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0520" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0520&rsqb;</number> Arguments for the Linking Report </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0521" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0521&rsqb;</number> Looking at the Search page for most reports used in the BayerONE application, it has three HTML inputs for each criteria. These inputs make a set that is appended to the URL when the Generate Report button is clicked. A URL is generated using any information entered on that Search page. We are creating that same URL in the Link URL field. These inputs are the same exact parameters in the order they need to be for the Link URL (compare, field and range). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0522" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0522&rsqb;</number> Example: from the Open Orders Report, Master Report Field Form: Lot compare0&equals;&equals;&amp;field0&equals;&lsqb;1&rsqb;&amp;range0&equals;&amp;compare1&equals;&equals;&amp;fleld1&equals;&lsqb;2&rsqb;&amp; range1&equals;&amp;customize&equals;N&amp;popup&equals;Y </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0523" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0523&rsqb;</number> The above example shows passing two arguments to the link report. Each argument must be passed using a set of parameters that are understood by the Reporting Module in BayerONE. compare&num;&equals;, field&num;&equals; range&num;&equals;. The number (&num;) is used to make each parameter unique. The first set of parameters must use the number 0, the second set must use the number 1, and the third set the number 2 . . . </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0524" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0524&rsqb;</number> If no value is to be sent with a parameter (like range in the above example) do not enter anything, just follow it immediately with the next parameter, leaving no space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0525" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0525&rsqb;</number> Compare compare&equals;The valid values for compare are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 62</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0526" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0526&rsqb;</number> Field: field&equals; should be the value you want to compare, either hard coded if acceptable field&equals;001 or a substitution field may be used if it is variable based on the row chosen. Substitution fields are listed in the Substitution field section of this page. In the Master Report Field Form picture shown above, there are two substitution fields shown product_family_code and product_family_name. To use the product_family code in the Link URL field place its &lsquo;order number&rsquo; in brackets field&equals;&lsqb;1&rsqb; or if you wish to use the product family name field&equals;&lsqb;2&rsqb; A field in the substitution field area may be used in the Link URL field more than once and can be used out of order (2 can be used before 1). These substitution Fields must appear in the Required Field section of the Master Report Main page and can be aliased on the page. If aliased on in the Required field section, they must also be aliased in the substitution Field for the correct value to be picked up in by the link. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0527" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0527&rsqb;</number> Range: range&equals; This is used only when the compare is Between, like between two dates. Like the field, the value can either be hard coded or come from a substitution field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0528" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0528&rsqb;</number> If passing parameters that need to be processed by the report include the parameter in the URL add the parameter search&equals;yes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0529" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0529&rsqb;</number> To not allow customization of a linked report add the customize&equals;N to the Link URL field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0530" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0530&rsqb;</number> To have the link report pop up in another window, add the parameter popup&equals;Y </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0531" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0531&rsqb;</number> To add further description to the title of a linking report, like including the product name or product family displayed, add the parameter drilldisplay&equals;&lsqb;subsitution field number&rsqb;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0532" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0532&rsqb;</number> Totalable: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0533" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0533&rsqb;</number> From the Master Report main page, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 63</cross-reference>, click on the Totalable link to go to the Modify Totals button at the top of the frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0534" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0534&rsqb;</number> Existing totals for the Master Report will be displayed in the top frame. To edit or delete an existing total, click on the Edit or Delete link on the far right side. To create a new total, click on the New Total link near the top left. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0535" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0535&rsqb;</number> If no totals have been defined for this Master Report, only the New Total link will be present as well as the column headers. A Top Frame for Master Report Totals is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 64</cross-reference>, and a Bottom Frame for Master Report Totals is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 65</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0536" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0536&rsqb;</number> To create totals on a Master Report, there must be at least one field each configured to be a Total By field and at least one configured to be Totalable. This is done in the Master Report Field Form and by checking the checkbox for Total By for a non-numeric field (i.e., month, or product) and Totalable for a numeric field (quantity or dollar amount). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0537" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0537&rsqb;</number> If in a particular report, there is more than one Total By or Totalable field created, they all will appear in the dropdowns. The ft Field to Total: is a dropdown field. When a value is selected, it will be summed up using SQL in the reporting module on BayerONE. The Total By Field will be added to the SQL statement in both the SELECT and in a GROUP BY. The items in the SQL statement will be ORDER By the Total By Field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0538" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0538&rsqb;</number> The Group By Field, is used when you wish to add another column to the total field that is not going to be summed up. It will add another column to both the SELECT statement and the GROUP BY statement that is constructed by the Reporting Module within BayerONE. An example of a Group By field would be a unit of measure. Any column added in the Group By Field must use the same aliases for the tables as the Master Report. A Total Example is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0539" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0539&rsqb;</number> Create a Custom Report </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0540" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0540&rsqb;</number> To Create a Custom Report, click on the custom link in the SecureNET Header the BayerONE application Link then the Custom Reports link on the left side (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0541" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0541&rsqb;</number> To Edit an existing Custom Report, click on the link under the column header Name (see Arrow <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0542" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0542&rsqb;</number> If you wish to see a Master Report that a particular Custom Report is associated with, click on the link under the column Master Report (see Arrow <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0543" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0543&rsqb;</number> To create a new Custom Report, click on the New Report button in the right corner (see Arrow <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0544" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0544&rsqb;</number> All Custom Reports are based on a Master Report. Custom Reports are one type of report that can appear on a user Desktop in BayerONE. Select the Master Report you wish to customize. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0545" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0545&rsqb;</number> If creating a new Custom report, a page will appear like the one in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</cross-reference>, except all editable fields have no values in them. If a Custom Report is being edited, the fields will be populated with the values that were entered for that report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0546" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0546&rsqb;</number> Name: The name of the Custom Report is the name that, if the report is published, will be the title of the BayerONE report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0547" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0547&rsqb;</number> Description: The Description will be displayed alongside the Name in the BayerONE application on the Search Page (if there is a Search Page for that report) and alongside the report title on the actual report page. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0548" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0548&rsqb;</number> Order By: Order By in the Custom reporting module sets the sorting order for the report within BayerONE. Refers to the field order number within the Custom Report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0549" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0549&rsqb;</number> This Order By field will override any Order By set in the Master Report, but it will not override a header field, if one is defined on the Master Report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0550" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0550&rsqb;</number> The Custom Report Order by will be tacked on behind any header field. In the example above, the Oracle&reg; ASC and DESC are used for ascending and descending order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0551" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0551&rsqb;</number> This Order By will be the default on the Report within BayerONE. If a user tries to customize a report, they can override those for their newly-created custom report (My Report header on the BayerONE desktop is where any user customized reports will be located). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0552" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0552&rsqb;</number> Save Changes: Will save the changes made on this page only, and if the report is a new Custom Report, that report will be created in SecureNET. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0553" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0553&rsqb;</number> Modify Fields: Opens the page, Custom Report Fields main page. It gives a summary of the fields in the Custom Report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0554" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0554&rsqb;</number> The order the columns will appear on the BayerONE report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0555" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0555&rsqb;</number> If the column is sortable or not in BayerONE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0556" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0556&rsqb;</number> If the field is designated as Search Field for BayerONE. Any field designated as a search field will show up on the Search Page for the report before the report is generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0557" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0557&rsqb;</number> If the field is displayed on this report in BayerONE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0558" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0558&rsqb;</number> If the field is required to be in the SQL for the BayerONE report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0559" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0559&rsqb;</number> Value is any additional information for the SQL&apos;s WHERE clause. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0560" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0560&rsqb;</number> When coming to this page for the first time, on the far right side, all the rows will have a blue &lsquo;Add&rsquo; link (Arrow <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</cross-reference>). Each row must be added. If editing an existing report, the options will be Edit and Remove (Arrow <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0561" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0561&rsqb;</number> Edit takes the user to an edit page to change the column properties for the Custom Report, thus changing the column&apos;s properties and functions for the BayerONE report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0562" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0562&rsqb;</number> Remove does not delete the column, it changes the link on the right to Add. Since all columns should be added, this really shouldn&apos;t be used at this time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0563" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0563&rsqb;</number> Order: This sets the display order for the BayerONE report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0564" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0564&rsqb;</number> Content is determined from the column options given to this particular column in the Master Report. The Product column was given search and display field options. If these options are not checked in the Custom Report, they will not take effect in the BayerONE report. This is the area where certain Master Report attributes can be overridden for this particular Custom Report. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</cross-reference>, the Expected Delivery Date was only given the display field attribute and cannot be used as a search field in the BayerONE report. If one wishes to change this, they will have to go to this field in the Master Report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0565" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0565&rsqb;</number> Comparison and Field Value &num;: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0566" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0566&rsqb;</number> These two fields help allow one Master Report to have many different reports based on it by adding to the WHERE clause. The example above, the Expected Delivery Date field from the 15 Day Order illustrates this point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0567" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0567&rsqb;</number> The information from the Comparison and Field Value &num; is used to construct a condition that is tacked onto the SQL statement&apos;s WHERE clause for this particular Custom Report when run in BayerONE. The only columns that can be put in the WHERE clause at this stage are columns defined in the Master Report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0568" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0568&rsqb;</number> When this type of statement is constructed in the BayerONE reporting module, the column name used in the SQL WHERE clause is taken from the Master Report Form Field&apos;s Field SQL for the column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0569" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0569&rsqb;</number> Comparison: This is the operand used for this portion of the WHERE clause. The following values are valid &equals;, &lt;, &lt;&equals;,&gt;,&gt;&equals;, &lt;&gt;, LIKE, BETWEEN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0570" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0570&rsqb;</number> Field Value 1: The static value you wish to compare with the column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0571" lvl="3"><number>&lsqb;0571&rsqb;</number> Field Value 2: This would only be used if the Comparison value is BETWEEN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0572" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0572&rsqb;</number> It is also a static value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0573" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0573&rsqb;</number> In the 30, 45 and 60-day Custom reports, the Expected Delivery Date Field Field Value 1 is changed to make each of them a unique report. They are all using the same Master Report, but the SYSDATE&mdash;15 is changed to SYSDATE&mdash;30, SYSDATE&mdash;45 or SYSDATE&mdash;60 to give different result sets when run in BayerONE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0574" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0574&rsqb;</number> When a column in a Custom Report has a value associated with it, this will be indicated on the main Custom Report fields page for that report. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0575" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0575&rsqb;</number> Now the Custom report is complete. The report needs to be made a system report and published to the customer&apos;s desktop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0576" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0576&rsqb;</number> The first step is to make the Custom Report a System Report for the BayerONE application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0577" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0577&rsqb;</number> To do this, click on the System link under the Association header (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</cross-reference>). This will open up a page called System Associations (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0578" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0578&rsqb;</number> All the reports that have been created against this database will be listed on this page, including personal Reports BayerONE users have configured for their own desktops (report that will appear under the My Reports header for a BayerONE user). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0579" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0579&rsqb;</number> By checking a report, this is the step allowing the custom report to become a system report, a step in making it to the desktop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0580" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0580&rsqb;</number> Once the report(s) is(are) checked, click on the Save Changes button. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0581" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0581&rsqb;</number> Now the report is a system report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0582" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0582&rsqb;</number> The next step to add a system report to a user&apos;s desktop is to add the report to the system desktop. See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0583" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0583&rsqb;</number> To do this, click on the System Desktop link under the Desktop. This will open up a page called System Block Templates (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
