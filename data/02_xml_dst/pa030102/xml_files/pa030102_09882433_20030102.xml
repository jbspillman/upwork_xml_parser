<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to architecture for an Internet Protocol (IP) centric distributed next generation network that supports data and telecommunication services. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The legacy telecommunication systems are transforming into IP Centric distributed systems. End users are increasingly using mobile devices for their communication needs. Traditional uses of fixed devices for communication such as PSTN phones are diminishing. Expectations for services desired by end users are increasing with time. Due to exceptional growth in Internet <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> technology, possibilities of service offering have increased tremendously. In wireless communication network, each mobile device has to establish local wireless link between itself and local access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The local access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is the part of the hierarchy of the network layers. Each network layer of the system can be owned and managed by one network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or can be owned and managed by multiple network service providers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Most services provided to the end users are from independent IP application service providers <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Network service providers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are missing out on tremendous revenue opportunity. It is not feasible for Network service providers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to develop and integrate varieties of services for end users. Moreover, present network service providers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are concentrating on providing voice services to the end users. Similarly, in wireless environment, home and visited network service providers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are seeking to provide end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> services for revenue. Network service providers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can not design and develop hundreds and thousands of possible IP application services for their subscribed end users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Thus, IP application services that are independently developed to provide e-commerce, e-games and many unlimited possibilities of IP applications that need to be integrated and deployed on a mass scale with the evolving next generation network by the network service providers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This mandates for the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the development of unique mobile portal and use of complementors (others) for speedy IP application service deployment. This also mandates the development of special application servers that provide mobile portal services along with other management services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Inspite of having functional component capabilities within the network, it is necessary for the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to share and/or distribute certain management capabilities to such complementors. This mandates the development of the necessary APIs through which management capabilities that control security, policy management, accounting, network management, and quality of service for services provided can be achieved. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In contrast to the prior art as in legacy telecommunication networks that services offered to the end subscribers are tightly coupled within the network, the present invention is based on the distributed concept of the next generation network architecture. The next generation network architecture provides distributed functionality of the network in logically separated components. These components interface with each other using Internet Protocols. The present invention provides a method and apparatus for providing service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> facilitates service provisioning capabilities and service management activities that take place between network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and associated IP application service developer or providers. This invention provides the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that facilitates network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to distribute and share key control capabilities to associate other IP application service providers <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The service provisioning and service management aspects provide multiple functions (tasks) to control the services provided to the end users. Some of these functions include security <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, accounting <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>, policy management <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, mobile portal control <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, configuration and provisioning <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, and resource management control <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight> to name few for the provided IP application services. The security aspect provides security of the services provided to the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&apos;s end subscriber through the associated IP application service providers <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Accounting management activities that need to be accounted for the services provided by the IP application service providers. Policy management functions that need to be considered when providing such IP application service by the IP application service providers. Based on the IP application service requirements and to provide desired quality of service, management of associated resource control needs to be performed. Such activities are coordinated, distributed, and shared properly between the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and IP application service developers or providers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a solution to achieve the above-mentioned tasks that provides maximum value proposition based on innovation and infrastructure. A unique innovative property of the present invention that makes ease of integrating/associating third party IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> with the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Additionally, it achieves security for use of services, accounting capabilities per user for services, policy management, and managing quality of services for the end users. A unique relationship is established within infrastructure of the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> through the use of unique mobile portal between network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the IP application service developer. Independent development of protocol servers and suitable protocol interfaces that provide session invocation and session control capabilities for the above described service provisioning and service management activities established by the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The concept and model presented for the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that comprises service provisioning and service management activities provides several advantages. These advantages include integrating and deploying IP application services rapidly in the network service provider&apos;s <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> infrastructure, ease of invoking desired services by the end users, ease of invoking desired quality of service by the end users, and most importantly, it enables network service providers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to offer unlimited ideas of IP application services to their end subscribers. Such IP application services can be &ldquo;Interactive mobile commerce&rdquo;, &ldquo;Interactive games&rdquo;, and &ldquo;SIP based services&rdquo;. In addition, convergence of telecom with many other fields such as finance, commerce, realtors, etc. will offer many other service offering opportunities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Therefore, in accordance with the previous summary, objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to one skilled in the art from the subsequent description and the appended claims taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>: The network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, is the network system that provides terrestrial access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to the end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> or subscriber. The network system is distributed in hierarchical layers of network components. The layer that provides access point is the access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be a part of the whole network or an independent layer from the network hierarchy. The network hierarchy with network components can be own and managed by a single network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or can be own and managed by multiple network service providers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> IP application service provider: An independent instance of an IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> provides specific IP application service to the end user. Different IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may provide different IP application services. Such an IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is not necessarily associated with the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that provides access capability to the end user. The proposed service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> facilitates to establish association between the IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Next Generation Network: The next generation network is the term used to distingue new network that is more distributed functionally from the traditional tightly coupled legacy network. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Next Generation Network Architecture&mdash;Abstract View </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The next generation network architecture shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>:Next Generation Network Architecture &mdash;Abstract View represents an abstract view of the wireless network system and components. Network system consists of access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and hierarchy of network components <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> controls access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and hierarchy of network components <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The network hierarchy <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is used to distribute network tasks in different regional areas. Network components provide essential tasks to control network activities to facilitate end users&apos; need. An access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> facilitates connectivity for the end users <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> with the network system. A single network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may own and manage an access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> as well as hierarchy of network components <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Or, access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and hierarchical network components can be owned and managed by multiple network service providers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Essential tasks of the network components <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> include session management task, handoff-related activities, policy management, accounting management, authentication, authorization, resource control management, security management, and network management. The session management task <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> facilitates network provided applications and services. The handoff-related activities facilitate continuous connectivity of mobile with the network system. The policy management task <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> facilitates and enforces network policy requirements. An accounting management task <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> facilitates billing and charge activities for the services provided and network resources used by other entities. An authentication task facilitates validation and admission of other entities to the network system. An authorization task verifies and allows use of network services and resources to other entities. The resource control management task facilitates proper provisioning of network resources. The security management task <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> facilitates to establish secured access between network systems and entities. The network management task, typically in legacy network, consists of fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security management (FCAPS) functions. However, in the distributed next generation network architecture, some of these functions are distributed in network components. Thus, the FCAPS functions complement network management tasks that are not accommodated using other tasks mentioned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In addition, network system consists of many other related network components that are not mentioned here for simplicity. Such network components provides task such as to facilitate IP address assignment for each device attached to the system, etc. if the mobile device is roaming, then an attached network system facilitates appropriate communication related activities with the mobile user&apos;s home network to provide appropriate service in roaming area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> components of the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> provide access point to the network system for end devices and users. For wireless network, an access point of the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> facilitates Radio/Frequency channels and necessary bandwidth for communication for mobile devices. Also, an access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> facilitates cell management <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> activities for handoff and hand-over activities. For non-wireless devices <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, an access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is not required to facilitate cell management <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> activities described earlier. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Need for Service Delivery Platform and Benefits </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Once attachment of end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> is established with the network system and IP address assignment completes, then an end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> can reach out for any IP application services provided by any IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. An independent instance of an IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> provides specific IP application service to the end user. Different IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may provide different IP application services. An IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> provides specific service to the end user. Thus, once access is established with the end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> through the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, role of network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> becomes limited. The revenue generated from the specific service provided to the end users belongs to an IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is capable to develop and offer IP application services to the end-users as it has immediate knowledge about the end users&apos; whereabouts and up to certain extent their profile. However, the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can not design and develop unlimited IP application services and offers to their subscribers. Thus, inspite of having necessary network components and mechanism in place to provide IP application services to the end users, the network service providers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are unable to offer such services for revenue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In order to overcome this problem, the present invention proposes service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> architecture. This service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> architecture allows the network service providers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to integrate third party developed IP application services in their network and provide capability to offer unlimited IP application services to their subscribers. The proposed service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> provides service provisioning and service management capabilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> offloads critical responsibilities from the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that facilitates IP application services to the end users. The distribution of essential tasks that facilitate IP application services to the end users from the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> alleviates responsibility of developing individual IP application services within network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&apos;s network. It helps to deploy IP application services rapidly in network service provider&apos;s <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> infrastructure. Additional benefits include ease of invoking desired services and ease of invoking desired quality of service. It also enables network service providers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to offer unlimited ideas of IP application services. To name few of them include interactive mobile commerce, interactive games, and Session Initiation Protocol based services. Many more services derived from convergence of telecom with many other fields such as finance, commerce, realtors, entertainment, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> With such distribution, the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> assumes high-level aggregation responsibilities for the IP application services provided to their subscribers/users. Such capability will increase revenue potential for the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> tremendously. This will simplify network system operations and take advantage of offering newly ongoing developed IP application services by the third party vendors. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>: Service Delivery Platform Architecture, a service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is introduced as a system component. This platform interfaces with the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&apos;s network components and access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> components, IP application service provider&apos;s components <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. An interface with an access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is limited in scope to the extent that is pre-defined by the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> domain. As shown in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>: Service Provisioning and Management Model, the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> consists of many tasks that have counterpart in the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The essential tasks of the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> include session management control, policy management, accounting management, resource control management, security management, mobile portal control <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>, network management that include configuration and provisioning management <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, and pertinent data base <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> component. The proposed service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> provides IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> provisioning and service management capabilities. The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> facilitates service management activities between network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, end users, and IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> facilitates IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> provisioning, required enabling end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> service activation procedures, and required interaction activities between end users &amp; IP application service providers <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> &amp; end users <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> &amp; network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Each task of the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> communicates using appropriate Internet protocol, internally with the service delivery platform&apos;s components and externally to the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&apos;s network components and access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> as well as IP application service provider&apos;s components and finally to the end users. It uses firewall <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> for security for first line of defense to achieve secured accesses. For an example, policy management task <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> between the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&apos;s network component is done using standard COPS protocol. It is possible to support multiple well-known standard protocols defined for specific tasks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the proposed model, the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> assumes responsibility of provisioning subscribers and their desired services. The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> assumes responsibility of provisioning IP application service providers <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. In doing so, the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> follows network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&apos;s guidelines in provisioning IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Also, the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> keeps necessary records related to IP application service providers <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, in local database. It is also possible to keep such records at the central database of the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and update it at predefined interval. Once subscribers at the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> at the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are provisioned, the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> manages delivery of IP application services to the end users. The service delivery platform&apos;s counter parts at the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> manages aggregation of final results rather than managing specific details that is specific to the IP application services provided to the end users. The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> architecture is scaleable and allows the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the ability to expand specific service delivery tasks independently of other tasks. Also, the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is capable to plug and play with the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&apos;s infrastructure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Upon attachment to the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by the end user, the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> downloads end user&apos;s profile, policy requirements, subscribed services, along with necessary management data (e.g. accounting method, etc.) to the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The service delivery platform&apos;s tasks verifies availability of the subscribed services at the IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, sets ups security aspect for the end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> to access IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The service delivery platform&apos;s mobile portal control <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> task pushes necessary applets and service invocation capabilities to the end device. Upon service invocation by the end user, request goes to appropriate IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. An IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> validates the end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> using security mechanism facilitated by the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that was setup earlier by the security management task <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. In case of IP application service invocation request and/or any parameter dispute, the IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> interface with the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for resolution. The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> resolves issues using subscriber&apos;s profile, policy requirements, accounting methods used, and any other pertinent details. If invocation request demands setup of additional resources, the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> based on subscriber&apos;s data and guidelines provided by the network system, facilitates additional resources directly to the access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> within limited permission granted or facilitates through the network components. Upon completion of IP application service, the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> collects appropriate accounting data from the IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and reports it to the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for aggregate billing and charging to the subscriber. The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may use other techniques to collect usage data. For an example, the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> requests to the end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> or a client running at the end device that collects usage data. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Scenarios of Operations </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Provisioning and maintenance activities summarize the operations that take place at the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As discussed in the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> architecture and model earlier, the subscriber&apos;s provisioning takes place at the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The subscribers&apos; pertinent records are located at the central database at the network system of the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. As long as the subscribers/end users are using default services of the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> such as simple access through the network, the interactions with the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> does not take place. When the subscribers/end users subscribe to the special services that can be provided through the provisioned IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, the involvement of the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> takes place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The IP application service provider&apos;s provisioning activities take place through the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The majority of the service delivery management activities are taking place at the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> assumes majority of service management activities and provides final aggregate results to the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The following scenarios are identified: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> 1. New IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> associate with the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> interfaces with the new IP application service provider&apos;s components to exchange necessary information such as IP addresses and port numbers of the involved components and establishes an access agreement. The configuration and provisioning task <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> interfaces with the policy management task <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> for the pertinent network policy and guidelines provided by the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The IP application service provider&apos;s pertinent information is kept at the database managed by the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> accesses such data from the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> when needed in order to offer such IP application services to the new subscribers and provisioning them with the network system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> 2. New subscriber <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> signs up (provisions) for the IP application service offered by the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> uses IP application service provider&apos;s related services and pertinent data such as IP addresses, port number, type of service, billing method, mutually agreed policy between IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, etc., from the service delivery platform&apos;s database. Once service is offered and accepted by the end subscriber, the subscriber&apos;s profile is updated at the central database at the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may be informed at this time to flag for potential IP application service user. However, it is not necessary at this time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> 3. Subscriber/end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> becomes active (establishes attachment with the network system) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Upon establishing attachment with the network system, the network system performs all typical operations such as to register subscriber/end user, fetching subscriber&apos;s profile from the local network system or from the home network system <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, IP address assignment, authentication and authorization tasks, as well as necessary default accounting methods, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Once above-mentioned procedures are performed, the network system fetches necessary subscriber&apos;s profile that reflects subscribed IP application services, accounting methods to use, and relevant network and subscriber&apos;s policy information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> This information is passed to the appropriate component of the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The session management task <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> of the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> executes necessary steps by coordinating with the security management task <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, policy management task <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight>, and mobile portal control <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> task of the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. These steps include making sure of availability of the IP application services from the IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, setting up the security mechanism between the end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and the IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, meeting pre-defined policy requirements, enabling mobile device with the service invoking capabilities based on the type of mobile device used, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> 4. An end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> invokes an IP application service </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> When an end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> invokes any particular service, an invocation request goes to the appropriate IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. By this time, the IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is configured by the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> tasks with the appropriate security mechanism to apply and end user&apos;s capability to use network system&apos;s resources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> There are two scenarios an IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may face: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> a) Normal operation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In this scenario, an end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> sends request to the IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> matches all requested parameters and determines that it can fulfill all service requirements without changing resources allocated to the end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and the service scope is within the limit and guidelines provided by the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In this case, the IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> renders IP application service. Based on the accounting policy for the service, complete usage record is transferred once to the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> or interim record at pre-defined interval to the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, if chosen, the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> collects usage data from the client collecting data at the end user. Based on the policy, the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> transfers service usage data to the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for aggregation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> b) Special condition operation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In this scenario, an end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> sends request to the IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> matches all requested parameters and determines that it can not fulfill all service requirements without changing resources allocated to the end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> and service scope is not within the limit and guidelines provided by the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In this case, the IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> interacts with the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to facilitate appropriate network resources. The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> performs necessary steps to facilitate end user&apos;s need based on the policy and guidelines provided from the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for that particular subscriber. The session management task <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> controls the execution in coordination with the policy management task <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> and resource control management task. The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> interfaces with the network system in order to accommodate or change in provided network resources. The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> interfaces with the access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> components if direct access is provisioned by the network system, else the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> interfaces with the network components of the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Upon resolution with the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> renders IP application service. Based on the accounting policy for the service, complete usage record is transferred once to the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> or interim record at pre-defined interval to the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, if chosen, the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> collects usage data from the client collecting data at the end user. Based on the policy, the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> transfers service usage data to the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for aggregation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Service Management Functions </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> has the following important functions that facilitate service provider&apos;s provisioning and service management functions: </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Security Management <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The security management task <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> provides mechanisms such that only subscribed end users can access IP application services provided from the provisioned IP application service providers <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. One of the techniques that can be used as defined in kerberos. In that case, the key distribution center and ticket granting service responsibility is at the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Different techniques can be incorporated to secure the use of service. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Accounting Management <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The accounting management task <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> collects usage data from the IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> for each service provided to the end users. Also, it is possible to collect network usage data from the access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> up to certain extent if the access to access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is granted by the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Also, it is possible that the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> collects usage data from the end user <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> or an appropriate application running at the end device. In any case, the accounting management task <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> reports data to the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for the final aggregation for billing and charges purpose. The accounting method to be used for a specific subscriber is provided to the service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> at the time of end device&apos;s attachment to the network service provider I <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> has the capability to start an accounting client to collect usage data at the access network <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, at the end device, or at the IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. It has capability to report whole data usage record at one time or to report data usage in pre-defined time interval or upon certain amount of data collection. The most efficient and simplest way to data collection and reporting is based on start time, end time, and specific bandwidth and quality of service provided for that period. If the quality of service and/or bandwidth parameters are changed and appropriate resources are facilitated for service requested during the active session, then multiple start time and end time with specific QoS and bandwidth need to be reported. The service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> can use any well-known standard protocols for the accounting management interfaces. Such protocols include RADIUS, DIAMETER, etc. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">An Example of an IP Application Service </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>: IP application service provider providing session control configuration shows an example of an IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> takes the role as IP application service provider <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> providing session control configuration as defined in 3GPP for next generation network architecture. The IP application service is using CSCFs&apos;s configuration in visiting network <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and home network <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> environment to provide session control capabilities for multimedia (voice, data, and video) application as defined in standard. In order to design and develop such service by the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and integrate within the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&apos;s domain results in increased complexity and transforms distributed network back to the tightly coupled network. Imagine how much complexity would increase with additional support of another session management protocol such as H.323&quest; Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>: IP application service provider providing session control configuration, any number of protocols support can be added in the network service provider <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>&apos;s infrastructure (domain) by integrating and deploying capabilities developed by an independent IP application service provider <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Such integration and deployment capabilities can be achieved and easily facilitated by the proposed service delivery platform <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Other examples include integration of entertainment, finance, e-commerce, m-commerce, multimedia services, and many unlimited ideas of IP application services developed in future. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> It is understood that several modifications, changes and substitutions are intended in the foregoing disclosure and in some instances some features of the invention will be employed without a corresponding use of other features. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the appended claims be construed broadly and in a manner consistent with the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
