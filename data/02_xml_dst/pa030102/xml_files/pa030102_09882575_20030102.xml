<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates in general to battery power management and, in particular, to a system and method for managing battery power for battery powered devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Many modern day electronic or electro-mechanical devices such as cell phones, calculators, personal digital assistants (PDAs), electric vehicles and so forth are battery powered devices. While these devices tend to make life easier for their users, the need to replenish their battery power can be extremely inconvenient at times. If a user is not careful, the battery power of such a device may run out while the device is in operation and must be recharged or replaced before the device can operate again. Further, if the battery dies while the device is in operation, crucial user-entered data may be lost forever. Not being able to use the battery powered device at crucial times or the possibility of losing data entered into the device all discourage people from using these battery powered devices. Therefore, there has been a long time need in the marketplace for a system and method that can keep track of the amount of power left in a battery so a user of a battery powered device can conveniently schedule battery recharge time or obtain appropriate replacement battery before the battery power runs out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One way currently used to determine battery power level is through power test strips. These power test strips are sold in the marketplace along with disposable batteries such as Energizer&reg; brand batteries of the Eveready Battery Company, Inc. A user simply holds one end of the test strip to the positive end of the battery and another end of the test strip to the negative end of the battery. By pressing the ends of the test strip to the battery, a user can determine the amount of power left in the battery when an electro-chemical process changes a portion of the test strip&apos;s color, forming a bar graph indicating the amount of power left in the battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another way currently used to determine battery power level is through different types of visual displays on the battery powered device itself This second way of indicating battery power level is generally used with battery powered devices powered by rechargeable batteries. Such devices include, but are not limited to, cell phones and PDAs. Remaining battery power is often shown on the display windows of these devices as, for example, a bar graph without indication of units of measurement. Without units of measurement, the bar graph only tells relative battery power, and cannot tell the exact amount of battery power left. Since the power drainage rate of a battery changes depending on whether the device is in active mode or standby mode and depending on the temperature of the device, the bar graph does not give a very accurate picture of remaining battery power. For example, while the bar graph may indicate plenty of power left when the device is in standby mode, a user may be unpleasantly surprised when the same device is activated and the battery power is quickly drained in but a few minutes. In this case, the low power warning comes too late and the user is inconvenienced by an inoperable battery powered device with a dead battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Still another way currently used to determine battery power level is through a low power warning that appears when the battery is about to become fully drained. For example, some calculators display a low battery warning a few hours before the battery is to run out. However, this type of low battery warning cannot tell the user whether the battery has two hours or two minutes of power left. Thus, this third method of indicating battery power is also inconvenient for the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Much of the reason behind the difficulty in predicting remaining battery power in these prior art devices lies in the fact that, in these prior art devices, the remaining battery power is calculated based on the voltage change of the battery. Voltage change, however, is not linear over the entire discharge time of the battery. With battery power also dependent on the operating temperature of the device, it becomes very difficult to accurately predict the remaining battery power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a new and improved method and system for managing battery power of battery powered devices is needed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a system and method for managing battery power of battery powered devices. The invention can be divided into a product portion and a battery pack portion. The product portion may be a cell phone, a PDA, an MP3 player, an electric vehicle, or any other battery-powered electronic or electromechanical device. The battery powered device&apos;s battery power management system has a system processor that runs a battery fuel gauge algorithm. The battery power management system also has at least one battery fuel cell electrically connected to the system processor. A battery data collector is electrically connected to the battery fuel cell, collects electrical power data from the battery cell, and transmits the electrical power data to the fuel gauge algorithm, where the electrical power data is converted to active and standby battery power information using a combination of the coulomb counting method and actual battery fuel cell data. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a system and method for battery power management. The method and system of the present invention can be used on any battery powered device such as, but not limited to, cell phones, PDAs, calculators, MP3 players, electric vehicles and so forth. However, for illustration purposes, the following detailed description will describe the present invention as being used on a cell phone. It should be understood that the present invention can easily be applied to other battery powered devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a perspective view of cell phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that uses a prior art battery power management system and method. Cell phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally has a casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a battery pack <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that is removably attached to casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and an antenna <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> that is also attached to casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Casing <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a data entry interface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a data display <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Data entry interface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has various alphanumeric entry keys as well as soft keys for scrolling through various menu features of cell phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The various cell phone functions are displayed on data display <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. For example, a battery power bar graph <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a signal strength bar graph <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>&mdash;both displayed without measurement units&mdash;are shown on cell phone <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Battery power bar graph <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a simple bar graph and does not indicate the precise amount of battery power available nor does it indicate the precise length of active or standby time remaining in the battery pack <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows a perspective view of a cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> using the battery power management system of the present invention. Cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a casing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a battery pack <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is removably attached to casing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and an antenna <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> that is also attached to casing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> Casing <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> also has a data entry interface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with various soft key and alphanumeric data entry buttons for dialing the cell phone and/or for performing other data entry or menu manipulation tasks. Information entered from the data entry interface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> or received from other sources can be displayed on data display <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>shows battery power information <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> being displayed on data display <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The battery power information <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may include remaining standby energy in percent and/or minutes and/or the remaining active energy in percent and/or minutes. The units of measurement of time or energy may change over the discharge time of the battery. For example, battery power information <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may first be displayed in units of hours of battery power left. At, for example, two hours of battery power until full drainage, the display may automatically change to minutes of battery power left. Additionally, embodiments of the present invention can display simple information as does the prior art device of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, even though much more complex or detailed information is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a graphical representation of the system and method for managing battery power of the present invention. Power management system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> generally has a portable product portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a battery pack portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A system processor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is located in the portable product portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. In addition to being used for managing battery power in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, system processor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is also used to run one or more programs or subroutines controlling the other aspects of cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> operation. Fuel cells <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are located in the battery pack portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Though only one fuel cell is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it should be understood that the battery pack portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may contain a plurality of fuel cells. In this embodiment of the present invention, a battery pack data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is also located in the battery pack portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Though <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> placed on cells <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, it should be understood that the physical location of battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is unimportant so long as it can collect battery fuel data <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of fuel cell <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> collects battery fuel data <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and sends the battery fuel data <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to a fuel gauge algorithm <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> located in the system processor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, or in addition, the battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> can store the collected battery fuel data <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and send the battery fuel data <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to the fuel gauge algorithm <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> at a later time and/or it can otherwise transmit stored data. The fuel gauge algorithm <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> converts the battery fuel data <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> into active and standby battery fuel information. Fuel gauge algorithm <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is a part of the software used to operate cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The system processor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the portable product portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can be any computer processor typically used in battery powered products. These system processors are readily available in the marketplace and therefore will not be described in further detail in this disclosure. System processor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> should be able to run computer programs including a program running the fuel gauge algorithm <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which will be described in more detail later below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> may be located in the battery pack portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> The battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> collects battery fuel data <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of cell <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by tracking the net current flow into and out of cell <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, by measuring the voltage of the battery pack portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and by measuring the temperature of battery pack portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> has a memory device used to store the measured battery fuel data <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> before the battery fuel cell data <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is transmitted to the fuel gauge algorithm <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> located in system processor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The memory device of battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> can be, but is not necessarily limited to, an EEPROM Many data collection devices currently available in the marketplace can be used as the battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the present invention. For example, battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> can be the High Precision Li-Ion Battery Monitor DS2760 manufactured by Dallas Semiconductor. However, other equivalent devices can also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The memory device of the battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> can store at least two types of data&mdash;real time battery power data and semi-permanent battery characteristic data. The real time battery power data can include, but is not limited to, net current flow into and out of cell <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, voltage drop across battery pack portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and real-time temperature measurement of battery pack portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The real time battery power data usually changes each time battery power information is sampled and is generally used to calculate the latest battery power of information in conjunction with the semi-permanent battery characteristic data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Unlike the real time battery power data, the semi-permanent battery characteristic data does not change every time the battery power information is sampled. The semi-permanent characteristic data contains at least the various battery full and battery empty points matched with a full range of different temperatures. The initial battery fill and battery empty points are preferably first obtained experimentally and stored in the battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Battery full and battery empty points are necessary because, since rechargeable batteries become gradually full and gradually empty, there must be a defined point where, for various battery maintenance purposes, the battery powered device must know whether the battery is full or empty. Artificially defined yet definite fully charged and fully empty points allow the battery powered device to know when the battery is fill or empty Since battery capacity is temperature and rate dependent, each battery full and battery empty point is associated with a specific temperature and stored in the battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The semi-permanent battery characteristic data is occasionally changed. As rechargeable batteries age, the battery loses its ability to store charge. Thus, battery full and battery empty points must be redefined periodically and then stored as new semi-permanent characteristic data, replacing the old semi-permanent characteristic data. Various methods of determining the new battery full and battery empty points exist and any one of which can be used for the present invention. However, for illustration purposes, one method of determining new semi-permanent characteristic data will be disclosed later below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The software that forms a part of the system and method of the present invention runs on system processor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the portable product portion <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Fuel gauge algorithm <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> may be a part of the main operations software of cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The main program of the software may control other cell phone functions such as, but not limited to, processing the incoming and outgoing voice data, dialing the cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, displaying caller ID, and performing various other typical cell phone functions. Either the fuel gauge algorithm or the main program can control displaying the fuel cell power information on the data display <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The fuel cell power information may include, but is not limited to, percent of power available if cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in standby and/or active mode, time until full power drainage of battery pack <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> if cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in active mode and/or standby mode, and any other battery power related information. The display can also appear in different measurement units, with the measurement units able to change as time passes. For example, the remaining battery power can first be displayed in units of hours. As battery power becomes depleted to a certain point&mdash;for example, to two hours of battery power left&mdash;the display may switch to units of minutes. The battery power information can be displayed periodically, constantly, and/or whenever requested by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The fuel gauge algorithm <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>, as has already been described above, can easily be written by one skilled in the art, based upon the foregoing teachings. For illustration purposes, however, one embodiment of such an algorithm will be disclosed below. It should be noted that the embodiment disclosed below is not the only method to carry out the present invention. Rather, any equivalent algorithm that can be written by one skilled in the art should be viewed as a part of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, the fuel gauge algorithm <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is written as one computer program function that can perform one of five different tasks. The function is called from the main computer program, with the main computer program instructing the function on which one of the five tasks to perform. Note the fuel gauge algorithm <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> can also be constructed as five separate functions, with each one of the functions capable of being called by the main program at the appropriate time. The five tasks that can be performed by the fuel gauge algorithm <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are FPINIT, FPUPDATE, FPEMPTY, FPFULL, and FPLEARN. Table 1 below shows a brief summary of the operation performed by FPINIT, FPUPDATE, FPEMPTY, EPFULL, and FPLEARN.

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a flowchart summarizing at what point each task is to be called by the main program FPINIT is called before any of the other tasks are called. The precise order for checking for the condition precedent before calling FPEMPTY, FPFULL, or FPLEARN is unimportant, and the order does not necessarily have to be the same as those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the main program calls FPINIT one time after cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is powered up. FPINIT is not called again until cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shut down and then reactivated or until a change in the power supply to the system is made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> step <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, FPINIT initializes all the variables to be used by the other four tasks of fuel gauge algorithm <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> before the battery fuel data <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is transferred from the battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> so that the variables will not cause an error in later calculations. These variables include, but are not limited to, expected full points over temperature, expected active empty points over temperature, and expected standby empty points over temperature. The values for these variables may, but do not necessarily have to be, stored in local arrays in units of milliamp-hours. If at any time there is an error initializing the variables in FPINIT, FPINIT returns an error message to the main program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Turning back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, while cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is turned on, the task FPUPDATE can be called by the main program as needed to update battery fuel information. Depending on programming needs, FPUPDATE can be periodically and automatically called by the main program, can be called by the user, or can be called an unlimited amount of times before the cell reaches the battery empty point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, FPUPDATE reads battery fuel cell data <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> transmitted from battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and calculates from the battery fuel cell data <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> various battery power information such as, but not limited to, remaining milliamps-hours, remaining energy in joules, and remaining standby/active runtime. At step <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, various battery fuel cell data <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is read from battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. The battery fuel cell data <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> includes, but is not limited to, voltage, temperature, current, and accumulated current (ACR). Then, at step <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, these battery power information can be calculated using linear interpolation of between two expected battery full and/or empty points, both stored as the semi-permanent battery characteristic data, to find the full and empty points at a specified temperature (remaining battery power is temperature dependant). The remaining milliamp hours is then calculated by subtracting the expected empty point from the current reading. The remaining energy and remaining runtime can then be calculated using the real time voltage and current measurements in accordance with familiar equations known to those skilled in the art The battery power information calculated can be passed to the main program for display or can be displayed immediately after the calculation of the information without first passing the information to the main program. If an error occurs at any time during the reading or calculation of battery data information, FPUPDATE returns an error message to the main program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, FPEMPTY may be called just before cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> completely shuts down due to reaching the battery empty point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, FPEMPTY resets the ACR to the expected empty point for a particular temperature. The reset is necessary to adjust for errors in the current accumulator due to factors such as quantization errors in the current measurement. Preferably, though not required, FPUPDATE is called just prior to FPEMPTY to increase the accuracy in estimating the power management system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> temperature. FPEMPTY should preferably not be called under extreme temperature conditions when rechargeable cells tend to act unpredictably, causing erroneous readings to the data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. When FPEMPTY is called, at step <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, the new expected empty point for that temperature is the linear interpolation of the expected empty points between the new expected empty point and another expected empty point at the next temperature increment. After this new accumulated current value is calculated, at step <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the new value replaces the old ACR. If an error occurs at any time during the calculation of data in FPEMPTY, FPEMPTY returns an error message to the main program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, FPFULL can be called just after the battery pack <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is charged from partially empty to the battery full point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, FPFULL resets the ACR to the expected full point for a particular temperature. When the main program determines that a full charge has been reached, it can call either FPFULL or FPLEARN (FPLEARN will be discussed in further detail below). FPFULL is the standard routine that is called most of the time. The reset is necessary to adjust for errors in the current accumulator due to factors such as quantization errors in the current measurement. For best accuracy, FPUPDATE should (but does not necessarily have to be) run just prior to FPFULL for an accurate estimation of the battery pack <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> temperature. Preferably, PFFULL is not called under extreme temperature conditions when rechargeable cells tend to act unpredictably. The new expected full point for that temperature is calculated at step <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and is the linear interpolation of the expected full points between the new expected full point and another expected full point at the next temperature increment. At step <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, this new accumulated current value then replaces the old ACR. If at any time an error occurs in the operation of FPFULL, FPFULL returns an error message to the main program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, FPLEARN is called when the accumulated charge reading is believed to be most accurate, generally when charging from an expected empty point to an expected full point. Unlike FPFULL, FPLEARN resets the expected full point stored as semi-permanent characteristic data in battery collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Instead of adjusting ACR to existing data, FPLEARN adjusts all expected full points for the entire range of temperatures to the ACR. To do so, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> at step <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, after calculating the new expected full point by using the interpolation method already described above, a multiplier is obtained by dividing the new expected full point by the old expected full point at that temperature The multiplier is then used to adjust all the expected full points for all temperatures. Finally, at step <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, the newly adjusted expected full points are stored in the battery data collector <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> as semi-permanent characteristic data. While FPLEARN can be called at any time, it is preferably called when a user is most confident in the fuel gauge reading The recommended best time would be after a complete, uninterrupted charge from completely empty to completely full at room temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an overall description of the battery data update process is as follows. At step <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is turned on. Sometime after cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is turned on but before any of the other four tasks of fuel gauge algorithms <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> are called, the main program calls FPINIT at step <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. After FPINIT is called, the main software may enter into a loop at step <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> so that FPUPDATE can be repeatedly called at step <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. After FPUPDATE is called and while still in the loop, the main program determines at step <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> whether battery pack <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is completely drained. If battery pack <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is completely drained, then the main program calls FPEMPTY at step <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. If step <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is called, the main program exits the loop at step <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> because cell phone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then completely and automatically shut down due to lack of battery power. If battery pack <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is not completely empty, the main program checks at step <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> whether there has been a partial charge of battery pack <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. If there has been a partial charge at step <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, then the main program calls FPFULL at step <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. If there has been no partial charge at step <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>, then at step <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> the main program determines whether there has been a full charge of battery pack <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. If there has been a full charge, then the main program calls FPLEARN at step <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. If there has been no full charge at step <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, then at step <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> the main program determines whether or not the loop is to continue. If the loop is to continue at step <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, then the main program goes back to the beginning of the loop at step <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. If the loop is not to be continued, then the loop ends at step <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
