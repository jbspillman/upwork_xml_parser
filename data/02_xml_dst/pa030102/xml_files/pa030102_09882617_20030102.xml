<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to memory devices and in particular to the circuit design, device design, and processing technology of the high speed, high density, and low power physical constructs for memory cores, IO data buffer arrays, and control blocks. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventional high speed and low power buffer storage systems have evolved over time. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a first generation buffer storage system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. There are 2 NFET pass transistors and 2 CFET, which formed a latch. The system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> uses no pull-up transistors for the latch portion of the cell. The problem with this type of system is that it was slow and unreliable to hold information. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a second-generation buffer storage system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In this system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> the SRAM cell using high value resistor pull up. The resistor consumes DC current, and is slow when a large array capacity is involved. As the density gets higher, it consumes large DC current and the circuit is slow. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a third generation buffer storage system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which uses thin-film Poly PFET (TFT) as active pull-ups. The TFT is attractive as the PFET and intra circuit connecting stacked in vertical space, hence the cell elements overlaps in the horizontal dimension yielding smallest bulk area. But like its predecessors, it is also slow, and suffers from leakage. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is the latest generation of conventional buffer storage systems <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> uses 2 bulk PFET as pull-up in the latch portion of the cell. The problems with this type of system are large cell area, and it is difficult to scale down in operating voltage because of fixed high VT in the CFET. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The more recent configuration uses the topology of 6 transistor cell. All of them are in the Si bulk. The cell size is bulky, but it has been successfully implemented with the latest CFET 0.15 um technology as photolithographic rules for layout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is important to realize that the IC cost is closely related to the horizontal cell size as one wishes fit more dice in a wafer. The cell pitches in each cell dimensions are related to the length of the bit lines and word lines hence to the array sizes. The capacitances associated with every main circuit element intra and/or inter cell wise play an important role in speed considerations, and the noise margins are often compromised by the designers with speed in conjunction with the dc/ac power consumptions in the determination of Vcc supply, and signal and acceptable noise levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, what is needed is a buffer storage system, which overcomes the above-identified problems. The present invention addresses such a need. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> An improved buffer storage cell configuration is disclosed. The buffer storage cell comprises four (4) CFET and two (2) Schottky diodes. It is suitable for voltage and physical scale-down and is inherently superior to the conventional six transistor (6T) SRAM cell. This device can be utilized to minimize area and power, increase speed and improve reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The cell can be a basic circuit element to form a core or can be utilized in arrays for various applications. The cell can be a standalone memory product or can be mixed with other products in the System On a Chip (SOC) environment. Applicable categories of commercial products include but are not limited to SRAM, DRAM, Flash, CAM, PLD and ASIC controllers or micro-processors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A cell configuration in accordance with the present invention is compatible with existing CFET/BiCFET, GaAs, or SiGe processes, which means it has the least entrance barrier for its acceptance by the foundries and to the system users. The 2-Diode and 4 CFET FET structure can be extended to include a PN junction diode where the device is totally insulated without utilizing biasing wells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A system and method in accordance with the present invention provides for an efficient solution for data storage and access. The constructs can be in the form of standard IC commodities of any organization, which contains the arrays employing the cells and/or techniques in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Still other fields of possible functional uses include but not limited to the buffer units of all main stream emerging IC products in digital telecommunication equipment, wire or wireless Telephony devices, CPU and disk cache, Digital Signal Processors (DSP). It can be used in CFET, BiCFET, GaAs, or SiGe processes or any compatible technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The means of providing various cost-performance memory solutions are many. For any system, the speed grade ranges from low to high are, Disk devices with search time in mS, Flash device read/write in uS, DRAM in 50 nS, and SRAM in near ns, 16Mb of &times;16 configuration, i.e. 1M&times;16, in 2-5 nS. It is always critical to provide options to a system designer with the basic memory cell and organizations of various high speed, low area, and low power to fit ones system unit application. In the digital RAM domain of semiconductor devices including DRAM, Flash, and SRAM, the trend is to scale down the physical size of the cells on chip, operating voltage and currents are less for each generation of advanced solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> A more efficient circuit means has been proposed as viable approach to implement control logics with Diode Transistor Logic. Previously in the 1980s, DTL was once the backbone technology in Bipolar transistors. This invention teaches concepts to realize control functions and levels by various CFET and SBD configurations in additional to Buffer cell applications. Therefore is cost-performance attractive as a generic logic and memory tool- box suitable for any SOC applications. This design approach, using pulsed diode decoding and CFET inverter for NAND gates, takes less area, more stable load curve, and faster than CFET designs.</paragraph>

</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Table I illustrates the Latch Mode </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Assuming the latch state was set previously, and the bit-lines are at &tilde;0.75 V (&frac12; VDD), the latches of the unselected or partially selected cells are stable when WLW is at either 1.5V or 0.75V and WLR are at either 0V or 0.75V. The SBDs are not conducting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The butterfly curves shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates the concept of the latch operation and state transition traces. Two sets of state transition traces are plotted for 1.5V and 5.0V supplies. Balanced SRAM cells require that P and N FET sizes held width ratio of &square;&equals;wp/2.5 wn approximately <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows that the latch can be held more or less stable by decreasing or increasing the width ratio of &square; in the cell. Table I shows the storage node voltage transfer traces during the bi-stable and switching operations. The latches are bi-stable at either states with bit lines at &tilde;0.5V, and if WLR swings at 0V or 0.75V, and WLW swings accordingly at 0.75V or 1.5V respectively. The stored 1 node will latch at 1.5 V or 0.75 V respectively and vice versa for the stored 0 node. Both diodes are reverse biased or slightly forward biased. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Read Mode (Table I) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Table 1 also shows typical node voltages at read, write and standby modes. During read operations, assume node one is a &ldquo;1&rdquo;, and WLW at 1.5V. The selected/unselected WLR is at 0V or 0.75V respectively, Vn<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is nearly 0.1V or less above WLR, Vn<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is at 1.5 V. d<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is off and d<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is conducting/off for the selected/unselected cells respectively. So there is a differential voltage across b and v/b of 250 mV due to the selected n<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> state. The lowering action of WLR is actually enhancing the states of the selected latch, and the reading won&apos;t cause any disturbance for the unselected cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The read current and transition is controlled by the bus line discharging from its recharged state of 0.75V toward 0.4V. The transient rate is dependent on the combined on-resistance of the NFET plus SBD and related bus line capacitance. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Write Mode (Table 1) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> To write a &ldquo;1&rdquo; state, the selected WLW pulls down to 0.75V, the unselected remains at 1.5V. This will reduce the latch hold condition to let it be overwritten by the bit-line bus signals. The write circuitry will bias the BL rising toward 1.5V and /BL to 0.1V or less. This will force the selected Vn<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to 1.0V, enough to topple the state. The unselected cells, however, hold its state since the &lsquo;1&rsquo; node sees 1.5V and is always stronger than the cathode node of the diode drive regardless of the bit line conditions. So the TWLC has a built-in protection scheme from write-disturb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Further protection of write disturb can be obtained by adjusting the SBD barrier heights. Contact metal of Pt will yield more offset than TiW. So depending on applications, the designer can gain approximately 200 mV margin by adjusting Vtsbd. FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> show typical I-V curves of SBD and the NFET. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">Stand-by mode (Table 1) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> For fast switching reasons. The standby BLs are biased at VCC/2&equals;0/75V or at 0.6 V which can be conveniently derived. At this level all latches will be stable to hold in their previous logic states. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Table II shows the waveforms of the cell terminals for consecutive write and read operations of 2 adjacent cells of 2 words sharing the same bit line bus. The sequence showed the pattern of write 0 and 0 read 0 and 1, and reverse the pattern.

<heading lvl="1">Other Useful Control and Driver Circuits </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Numerous useful circuit embodiments can be formed using the combination of CDTL&trade; of CFET transistors and SBD. We simply demonstrate a few of its generic applications; namely, functional gates of level shifter and driver, decoder, operational amplifier, etc., and special effect such as to suppress latch-up action of the closely separated NFET and PFET transistors. Still another effect is to program the device thresholds with logic conditions, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Some of the above circuit constructs are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. They serve as set of control circuitries to form a custom circuit library supporting the DSRAM,&trade; operations. It also demonstrates that SBD can be used as a general active element with conventional CFET/BiCFET/GaAs/SiGe techniques, thus adding a powerful option and flexibility for circuit designer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The Twin Word Line Driver (TWLD) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> uses the SBD (consider a high VB device of VF&equals;0.7V) to achieve desirable level offset from main supply to form two totem pole ports; the word line for write (WLW) and the word line for read (WLR) for each word decode of the DSRAM cell array. Now for the WLR portion, when the input signal at node <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> governs the mode of operations. When it is at 0 V, the circuitry is in write mode. When it is at 1.5V, the circuitry is in read mode. During the write mode, node <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is high, if node <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is low (selected decode) it will make node <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> high, and node <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (WLR) goes to low. If node <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is high (unselected), it will make node <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> low, and node <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> goes to high. For the WLW portion, if node <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is high (unselected), it will make node <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to low, and node <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (WLW) to high. If node <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is low (selected), it will make node <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to high, and node <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (WLW) to low. Note that the low state of WLW is 1 diode drop above the ground of T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the high state of WLR is one diode drop below the VDD of T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Still another variation, which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is that D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be moved to the source side of T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and shared with of all decoders in the bank of the N FETs, so does that the D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be moved to the source side of T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and shared with of all decoders in the bank of the P FETs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> During the read mode operation, node <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is at high state. This will make node <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to low, and node <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>(WLW) to high. For the WLR portion, node <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> will be at low state. If node <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is low (selected), it will make node <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to high, and node <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(WLR) to low. If node <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is high (unselected), it will make node <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to low, and node <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(WLR) to high (0.75V). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The above circuit is only one of the solutions for the control logic. There may be other solutions which can be implemented by synthesis software to yield similar circuit functions, but may not be as efficient as we illustrated. The output pair signal levels are shown in Table I. Other state machine synthesis techniques can be used to yield similar logic functions but will not be as efficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The important concepts demonstrated are that </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> 1) TWLD is efficient in using about &frac12; VDD swings, and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> 2) It is faster and consumes only &frac14; of full swing word lines, and that </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> 3) It separates the word line currents into two portions; one feeds the PFET sources which has less current requirement, the other feeds the NFET sources, which carry the heavier part of the ac switching current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> 4) The cell array well has much less current spikes than the 6T SRAM constructs, therefore it reduces the noise level in the wells and improved array reliability. And since the well noise level is greatly reduced, it allows tighter spacing and less tapings between N type (for PFET) and P-type (for NFET) wells, this is an important area saving feature. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">The NFET Totem Pole Drivers for &frac12; VDD Swing </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Still other techniques are proposed, in later sections, to offer NFET totem poles for the TWL drivers. The above CFET totem pole configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> offers by default a partial signal swing desirable for this application. The drivers output levels may also be formed by various combinations of active CFET, NOMS drivers and diode offset adjustments as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. These constructs will offer voltage resources at no dc power from rail to rail to any intermediate levels at the designer&apos;s discretion. In our case they can be VCC/NVSS&plus;&minus;Vtn,/NVtp and VDF; i.e. 0V, 0.3V, 0.4V, 0.5 V, 1.1V, 0.75V etc. These solutions are adequate and flexible to realize any level shifting functions. They are highly valuable circuit techniques for a wide range of ASIC and memory product applications including DRAM, SRAM, CAM, Flash, PLD, and u-processors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows the pre-charge control circuitry for the bit-line buses. Diodes A-D and T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> form one of the 16 4-way nand decoders, and output nodes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> provide control signals and biasing voltage for the array bus lines for restoration to a pre-charged state. Diode A and other 3 way diodes receive other (address) decoding inputs. If all the inputs are high then node <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> goes to high, hence node <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> goes to low, otherwise node <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> clamps to low, hence node <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> remains at high. The assumption is that the diode conducts below 450 mV and Vt of T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is around 600 mV, and the sub-threshold current of Ti at 450 mV is nil. If this is invalid then one must use higher threshold NFET. T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has enable signal at its gate. When it is at Vss level, T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will provide source bias current to feed the diode circuitry and perform decoding function. The enable signal can also be a higher order decoding output, such as 1-of-8 code from logic signals E,F,G to expand the decoders from 4-ways to 7-ways (16 decoders to 128 decoders). T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> output node <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> provides out of phase logic signals from node <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to control biasing functions (part of the Bit-Line Bus, drawing <highlight><bold>1910</bold></highlight>). Nodes <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> provide both phases of internal logic for the NFET totem pole of T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Outputs at <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> make both the &frac12; VDD biasing voltage source (Read Prech) and the control signals to gate it to the bit line bus pairs (BL, /BL). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Prior to the beginning and after the ending of the pulsed period, node <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is driving at 0.75 (or 0.6 with controlled variations) volt, T<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-T<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are conducting, so both bus wires are pre-charged to &frac12; VDD. During the pulsed period for write or read, T<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>-T<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> transistors are not conducting, and the bus wires are released to Hi-Z state from pre-charged state for other circuit activities described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shows a circuit configuration variation of the same function. The decoding diode tree is formed and biased by a dual logic of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> circuit. So instead of NAND decoding, the NOR decoding is performed. NFET is used for T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and a limited biasing current is sinking to VSS. The SDB will clamp the PFET of T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> from conduction. The advantage of this configuration is that all diodes can be integrated into T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> It is an important concept here that this circuit offers static intermediate voltage sources by circuit configuration using NFET totem pairs rather than CFET totem pairs, which provides rail to rail swings. This circuit offers reference voltage(s) regulator without dissipating any DC power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> If other intermediate levels are desired for applications, we can add SBD diode padding schemes between the drains of T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> similar to the situation described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> in the previous section. Therefore, with the level shifting schemes illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, assume VDD&equals;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>.<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>V, and Vt_fet_lo&equals;0.3V, Vt_lo_sbd&equals;0.3V, Vt_hi_sbd&equals;0.5V, Vt_fet_hi&equals;0.5V, we can derive several discrete voltage source levels any where between VDD and Ground; i.e., Vsource equals 0v (VSS_nfet), 0.3V (VSS_nfet&plus;Vt_lo_sbd), 0.7V (VDD_nfet_hi_Vt_lo_sbd), 0.9V (VDD_Vt_nfet_Lo&minus;Vt_sbd_lo), 1.2V (VDD_pfet_lo&minus;Vt_lo_sbd or VDD_nfet_lo), 1.5V (VDD_pfet). When ever possible, it is recommended to use NFET totems because of the area and speed advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Now, after the pr-charge is done, the bit line buses are let-go, i.e. Write-Data (<highlight><bold>1907</bold></highlight>) and/or the sense amplifier (circuitry SA <highlight><bold>1908</bold></highlight>) takes over control to read the bus signals during the designated pulse period, when the sense amplifier is also active for the selected bit channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Table 2 shows the waveforms of two bits of the array switching operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The signals are listed in order to show critical timing relationships of a complex switching sub-system. The write and read streams are illustrated of two cells in the same bit-line buses <highlight><bold>1910</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. In the test pattern of 8 consecutive 5-ns cycles, cell <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> of word <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> and cell <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of word <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are alternately written by a 0-1 sequence and read out, then followed by a reverse written and read action by a 1-0 pattern. The simulated results show that not only the array cells (of Scell) can each be successfully operated in the defined high-speed schemes, but their information will not be disturbed by opposite operations nor any cross-talk activities from the adjacent Scell. Each channel can process information at 200 MHZ cycles, so in a 16 bit wide chip using this core array, say 1M&times;16 SRAM, it may achieve 3.2 GBPS bandwidth. For a 256K&times;64 chip organization the bandwidth is 12.8 GBPS. It is believed that a fine tuned design the speed or bandwidth would be even higher. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is the implementation of a diode decoder in comparison with the conventional CFET transistor decoder (i.e. NAND<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by stacked transistors). Two circuit concepts are demonstrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> 1) The DCFET logic and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> 2) Level conversion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Node <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may receive a low-level logic input with partial swing. This level may be 0-0.75 V or 0-1.5 V depending on the application. Therefore node <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be half or full swing dependent on the VCC setting of the inverter of TI and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Node <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> drives the SBD decode bank at node <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. When all nets at A, B, C, D are at &ldquo;1&rdquo; state then node <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will go to &ldquo;1&rdquo; state, which will drive the output node <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> to ground. If any of the diode inputs held at &ldquo;0&rdquo; state node <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> will maintain at &ldquo;0&rdquo; state, thus node <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> will be fully charged up to 1 state. The diode can be integrated into the input driver T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or being discrete clustered at node <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The circuit design trade-off is the wiring capacitance of node <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or at node <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. So high speed large decoders favor the discrete version while low power high density applications favor the integrated decoders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> form a rail to rail totem pole inverter, which can be replaced by a NFET totem pole driver if in-phase half swing logic is desired as we discussed in the situation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> serves both the biasing and logic extending functions explained in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> above. The diodes clamp the &ldquo;0&rdquo; state of node <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to a level just a little below the Vtn of T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, therefore it inherently guarantees its off-state of T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at all temperature ranges yet assures fast turn-on switching when decoding is ready. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> The above diode decoding schemes offer tremendous advantages over the conventional CFET nand/nor decoding. Because the CFET NAND devices are both bulky and suffer seriously in performance due to RC losses with staggering transistors and associated gate loading. Switching transients of NAND gates degrade drastically beyond 3 stacking transistors and/or large fan out wiring and gate loads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> shows various circuit configurations to derive interface voltage levels. It shows a great flexibility to design the CDTL&trade; circuits for proper interface level while achieving area savings, and leakage controls. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows sub-groups of DSRAM cells sharing common resources <highlight><bold>1910</bold></highlight>; bit-line bus, pre-charge, write-data gate etc. The sense amplifier, decoder, and IO circuitry are conventional and hence are beyond the scope of this presentation. However, the cell operation modes described above are sufficient for accessing the large array of cells with burst read/write cycles of 5 ns (data rate will be 200 Meg Bauds) per channel. In a 1M&times;16 array sub-system, the bandwidth will be 3.2 GBPS, 12.8 GBPS for a&times;64 chip. We now present the physical design concepts. </paragraph>

Array Physical design constructs (Reference <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> A, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>B, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) Some of the layout details are illustrated here for completeness. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</cross-reference> shows layout arrangement for a sub-array group of a large array implementation. These designs considered the area efficiency as well as performance and reliability issues comprehensively with given device rules from process definitions. Repeating array constructs are shown in the left (drawing <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>). Again, the wiring layouts here demonstrates concept only, they are not optimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> There are banks of cells in a row, which composed of cells detailed by region <highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1901</bold></highlight> shown in the right. The adjacent cells are first making a pair by left/right mirror images along the left edge of region <highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight>, then repeating pair wise along the right side of the pair to form a quad. Sub-region <highlight><bold>1900</bold></highlight> basically groups all NFET of the array cells as they all share one contagious P-well region, which has periodic well contact (<highlight><bold>1902</bold></highlight>, PWC).

<heading lvl="1">The SCFET Technology (FIGS. <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> The SBD CFET (SCFET) is derived with the standard CFET technology with deviations in adding a mask step to select the anode hole openings, and barrier metal preparation. The cathode resistance implant is an option to lower its series resistance for tailoring a desirable I-V curve. The diode can be separated from the NFET by itself, and can also be incorporated in multiple anodes sharing the same cathode contact region. Other applications include but not limited to the decoders, well biasing, VT lowering or enhancing, ESD and latch-up protection. The anodes are made in various embodiments such as in the source/drain regions, well regions and/or near the guard ring regions of an IO block. These features are disclosed in this section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> The process steps and conditions are elaborated. This is depicted in region <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, a</cross-reference> typical embodiment is presented for the NFET FET and its integrated Schottky barrier diode. These are key elements to form the latch, T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> (Circuitry <highlight><bold>1906</bold></highlight>), described in the previous section. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Following the conventional CFET processes, we prepare a P- type <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>-crystal substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the wafer is about <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> mils thick, the Boron concentration is approximately 10<highlight><superscript>15 </superscript></highlight>atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. Then we prepare the device isolation walls( thick &tilde;2 um, and/or thin &tilde;0.4 um, layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) with enhanced P-type diffusions at their bottom (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>). In the mean time, diffused N-well (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, C&equals;1E16 level) and P-well (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, 10E16) sub-regions are formed during the oxide drive-in thermal cycles. Several schemes in the industry are well known; the LOCOS and TRENCH approaches can both be considered depending on cost-performance and other functional requirements in the specific product applications. Here we cite our case on the conventional Thick and shallow Trench isolations <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The conventional wafer process then calls for gate region threshold (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) and punch through protection (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) implants. After oxide removal, thick gate oxide GOX 7 nm is grown (not shown, but similar to <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>), then thin gate oxide (GOX layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, 3.5 nm) and Poly Si Gate deposition (<highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) and their formation for the internal 1.5 V devices and external 3.3 V devices used for the high performance products. Other higher GOX thickness are well characterized in the literature for higher voltage operations and cost-performance applications. The gate-polys are delineated by the RIE method with gaseous etch agent, then coated by the low temperature CVD oxide, RIE again to form the gate sidewall spacer (<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>). The spacer RIE also forms the self-aligned contact openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> The FET source drain regions then are treated with p<highlight><superscript>&minus;</superscript></highlight> implants in the N FET P-well region to reach and the N- type donor concentration at 1-5.0E16 atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>in the source and drain region (layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and 16 for the P-FET). This is the desirable background for making SBD anodes as well as yielding NFET LDD side diffusions to lower the lateral electric field intensity near the drain. The N&plus;&plus;implant <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> concentration is about 2.0E20 atoms/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, is done near the surface, to further lowering the source/drain resistances to &tilde;30 ohm/square surrounding the contact opening region. The SBD Anode region (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>) would be blocked out from receiving N&plus;&plus;implants, so contact metal silicide (TiW/Pt at 650&deg; C. or lower) is formed at the designated anode contact hole opening (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>). Elsewhere, the same contact metal will form ohmic contacts at the N&plus;&plus;(<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>) or P&plus;&plus;(15, for PFET) regions of the source/drain contact hole openings. The SBD cathode region (N- background) started from underneath the anode contact area, extended laterally all the way to the NFET source/drain N&plus;&plus;region. This region, &tilde;0.3 um deep, may also receive optional buried N&plus;&plus;implant, thus an optional mask can be used, to lower cathode resistance of the said SBD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Related metal processes are well known by conventional approaches. The preferred embodiment cites Titanium W/Platium thin film depositions &tilde;0.02 um depth, silicide sintering, and etching. This Ti&mdash;Si layer can also be used for short runs and light currents to connect the S/D to the top Poly openings in the non-critical area (layer <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, local inter-connect, described in later sections), W and/or Al deposition and etching etc. to form SBD with various barrier heights or ohmic contacts, and interconnecting 1<highlight><superscript>st </superscript></highlight>metal wirings &tilde;0.4 um thick. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SBD Structure, Integration to NFET, and Device Curves (FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>A) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> The method of making a SBD device in a bipolar NPN transistor structure were disclosed by Chang in U.S. Pat. No. 4,005,469. Here we redefine it and apply to the MOS N-type transistor embodiment. The fabrication processes of making the integrated NFET/SBD are essentially compatible to CFET processes for the part of diffusion and isolation, implants, contact opening, contact metal and inter layer metal wiring steps described above. The major deviations involve the pre-contact preconditioning, barrier metal selection, and 1 or 2 (optional) masking steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> The I-V characteristics are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. At low current levels, the barrier height determines the cut-in voltages. The very contact metal work function and the N- type Si impurity concentration level in the silicide proximity determines barrier difference. It is well known in the field to use Pt or Al to make SBD conducting at 0.6 V level. The Ti&mdash;Si diode cuts in at 350 mV. Still another means to adjust forward I-V curve is the contact sizes, buried cathode resistances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> The key process steps (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>) are to select proper contact metal for deposition, sintering and etching, make ion implant beneath the contact region to lower the cathode series resistance, this region is extended to the MOS drain contact area, and forms an integrated NFET/SBD device pair. This integrated structure has minimum anode-cathode area, and its packet capacitance, compared with a discrete pair. Multiple SBD can be efficiently embedded in a common drain/cathode region such as in a decode logic input signal drive situation. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> cites an embodiment applying the most aggressive implementation with the Silicon On Insulator (SOI) scheme. In this device architecture, there is no diffused wells (N and P wells) involved, so in addition to SBD diodes, the PN junction diode can be used as options to construct the 4-Tx cell. Two circuit configurations are proposed. One uses diode with integrated NFET pointing inward to the internal nodes of the latch (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</cross-reference>), the operation is similar to our DSRAM case. The other uses diode with integrated PFET pointing outward from the internal nodes of the latch (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</cross-reference>), A dual operation with respect to this invention can be developed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</cross-reference> shows the respective circuit schematics for the P-N junction diode implementations. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Latch-up Protection (FIG. <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, Region <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows the parasitic PNPN latch-up circuit model of the unprotected CFET circuits in the core or IO area. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> shows conventional means for protection by well tapping. It costs a lot of spacing to place guard rings to keep NFETs separated from PFETs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> We devised a scheme in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> to form SBD and connect it between the hot wells and GND/VDD source contacts. This practice can cause two circuit effects. First, the SBD suppresses the well to the bulk FET parasitic P-N junctions in each well, so the PNP/NPN parasitic device actions are eliminated by the SBDs. Second, if the hot wells are charged up for the P-well, or pushed down for the N-well, to the clamped diode voltage, it will cause the main FET devices in the localized regions VT shift toward lowering values. Therefore, one may take advantage of this situation by biasing the wells with either cold or hot by logic switching circuits. This feature is demonstrated in concept in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> We have a totem pole driver pull-up device T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, its well is connected to logic circuitry which vary according state of the related signals. The circuit nodes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are identical to a decoder discussed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The difference is that we need a partial swing logic levels. Node <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has the rail-to-rail signal, the WLR output at node <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> requires for 0.75 V when idle and 0 V when selected. This is obtained by a NFET totem pole output there (T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> pair). More to this point, the high level is obtained by the Vtn drop from VCC of T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Its P-well node <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is controlled by a biasing circuitry from nodes <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> When the driver is unselected, node <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> (P-Well of T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) is biased at 0.5V via T<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and node <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and SD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are on, T<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is off, so node <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is at 0.8 V (T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, hot-well, Vtn&equals;0.7V). When the driver is selected, Node <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> goes low, node <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is biased at 0V via T<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and node <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, T<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and SD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are off, so node <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is at 0.7 V (assume T<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> Vtn &equals;0.8V). We have thus achieved dynamic Vtn control, which gives different active device characteristics by circuit means rather than by process (Ion Implant). In a situation of making a mid-level voltage source generator without consuming dc power, this fine tweak may be an important technique. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> Still another advantage of this invention is the size of related hardware. Since WLR has heavier current load than WLW, It is important to use a NFET to drive than PFET which is slow, larger and more process variation. So the NFET totem is much more efficient than the CFET totem. And the related well control circuitry can be implemented with minimum rule devices. Thus this scheme can be incorporated to all decoders around the peripheries. And we have achieved all advantages in speed, and savings in power and area. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">ESD Protection (FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Still another application of this invention (SCFET) is to use SBD in the input circuitry for ESD protection. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference> shows an ESD scheme, whereby SBD are used to discharge excess charges stored externally without damaging the input gates and without speed degradation. The excitation model is a 2000 pf &plus;/&minus;2000 V with series resistance 2000 &square;; a typical human body contact environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Unprotected inputs will see huge current spike of 1A and time constant of 4 uSec. This arc will strike the IC and destroy wiring, any device connected to the input pads. Conventional protection uses PN junction diodes of FET diode configurations for series resistance and current surges. However, the side effect is it comes with heavy speed penalty. The parasitic capacitances and series impedance easily added the Cin to several pf, the slew rate at the input gates degrades severely when receiving signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> We propose using SBD for the ESD protection. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> diode curves, we can see that the VF of a 0.5&times;0.5 um ideal SBD is very effective to handle huge currents. The series cathode resistance can be very high for it was made by a shallow N- layer near the surface. If the parasitic junction is grounded, The combined SBD of DU and DL should be adequate for ESD protection. The added input capacitance is nil, and the area is much smaller than conventional designs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> 3. Summary of the Advantages </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> 3.1 The Schottky-CFET Technology </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> Process compatibility: It is 95% compatible with existing CFET processes. Therefore the cost barriers of process changes are minimum. The main deviation from CMOS are Schottky device formation; the Schottky-contact select masking, the barrier metal deposition, and the surface concentration preparation, which are compatible in nature but need to be fine tuned for the desired device properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> 3.2 DSRAM&trade; 4T-cell (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>) and its Control Peripherals </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> The primary advantage of the cell is its reduced area in the bulk and cell stability. This is based on circuit and device architecture hence is independent of process rules. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> shows side-to-side layout comparison to the 6-T cell using same feature features and rules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> In the DSRAM circuit configuration and device topology, we replaced the pass transistors of the conventional 6-T cell with the SBD diodes, and achieve many Area, Speed, and Power advantages from the Cell Array and its Control Logic: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> 1. The 4T&plus;2 SBD architecture only takes &frac23; area of the conventional 6T&times;implementations. 25-30% density a n d speed advantage is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> 2. The cell topology provides special write/read protection by diode isolation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> 3. The bulk area saving comes mainly from the elimination of poly word line. Instead, the word decode function is provided by complementary signals to the sources of the FET. And the three terminal pass transistors are replaced by a two terminal integrated diodes. Although two word line signals are required, they are absorbed into the supply lines, and they may be distributed in the stacked metal layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> 4. The new Twin Word Line Driver ports only see FET source pocket capacitances and the source to gate overlap capacitance, which are much less than the full gate load of two pass transistors. Besides, WLW only sees PFET load, and WLR sees NFET load, therefore the total and each twin driver load, are greatly reduced. The decode sub-driver sizes may be smaller. Designer may be able to handle more cells in the word line direction, improve speed, or do both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> 5. SBD decoder is faster and uses less stages, and less total areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> 6. The TWLW and TWLR signals have reduced signal swing from rail to rail to VDD/2. Power saving is 75%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> 7. Both WLW and WLR are using negatively going pulse, area efficient and speedier circuit can be implemented since it uses a N-Type pull-down driver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> 8. Repetitive P-well contacts may be moved to less critical area. Since there are no pass transistors, and the WL pitch is &frac13; less, it follows that along the bit lines, there are no more drain capacitance, and drain to gate overlap capacitance with each cell. So the BL capacitance is much smaller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> 9. For the shorter run of bit-line bus nets, the designer can either increase the word size dimension (higher array capacity) or gain faster speed or both. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> 10. Both the PFET and NFET can now use minimum width. The cell size is further reduced.
