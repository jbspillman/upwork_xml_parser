<summary-of-invention>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a feed conveyance system, specifically a unique means of delivering animal feed from a hopper by pneumatic conveyance to an elevated animal feeder in a remote field location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The problem to which this invention is directed is developing a system by which a user can efficiently load an elevated animal feeder. Traditionally, loading an elevated animal feeder in a remote field location is accomplished by carrying bagged feed up a ladder, lifting the heavy bag above the user&apos;s shoulders and manually dumping the contents. The present invention replaces the current method of carrying and lifting with convenient and practical pneumatic conveyance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A primary concern of those interested in promoting animal populations for recreational hunting is the supplementation of nutrient sufficient food supplies during those times when naturally occurring forage is not adequate to support dependent animal populations. This is especially true during the fall and winter months; the time for most recreational hunting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Over the years, automated remote animal feeders have been developed which are intended to automatically dispense a predetermined quantity of feed to the availability of the animals over time. Animal feeders are elevated by design above a height where there might be interference by a foraging animal. Such animal feeders may be wind powered or powered by small electric devices using common batteries. While these feeding systems are efficient at dispensing the feed, the feeding systems have to be periodically recharged manually with feed. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,926,441 to Zinsmeyer et al. (1999) and 5,873,326 to Davet (1999) dispense feed by means of an electric motor and timer. The timer activates the motor and the motor provides the means to distribute animal feed on the ground or in troughs on set intervals. While efficient at dispensing the feed, this type of design does not provide any means for loading the feeder, only the dispensing of loaded feed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other animal feeding systems are wind- or movement-powered, thereby eliminating the need for electricity or batteries as described above. With the foregoing in mind, there is a pressing need for an efficient means to load these elevated animal feeding systems. All the above referenced systems, provide a system for disbursing feed. All have the disadvantage of having to be manually loaded. There is no system for non-manual loading of an animal feeder. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a conveyance system for loading a remote animal feeder hopper, more safely, efficiently, conveniently, and in less time than the traditional manual method. The referenced art provides no means for loading the animal feeder hopper. The present invention&apos;s emphasis is on the loading of the animal feeder hopper. The employed equipment can remain in the bed of a truck or on the ground and provides an efficient method for loading a feeder hopper. A predetermined amount of feed will be placed in the Speed Feed hopper. Then, a flexible hose will be extended into the feeder hopper, the blower started, and the feed pneumatically conveyed into the elevated feeder hopper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the present invention is safety in that it does not require an individual to climb a ladder while lifting a heavy feed bag above one&apos;s shoulders. Injuries often occur while loading elevated feeder hoppers in this manner; an individual may lose their balance and fall off of a ladder or otherwise sustain injury because of the required lifting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is another advantage of the present invention to provide a new and improved apparatus for avoiding the intense manual labor of loading feeder hoppers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a new and improved apparatus for loading a feeder hopper which may be easily and efficiently manufactured and marketed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved apparatus for loading a feeder hopper which is of durable and reliable construction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> An even further object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved apparatus for loading a feeder hopper which is susceptible of a low cost of manufacture with regard to both materials and labor, and which accordingly is then susceptible of low prices of sale to the consuming public, thereby making such apparatus for loading a feeder hopper economically available to the buying public.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In using the Speed Feed delivery system, an individual places feed into the loading hopper <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The Speed Feed delivery system may be placed on the ground or the bed of a truck. This keeps the user from having to lift the feed bag beyond waist height. The inclined bottom <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> insures the feed is gravity fed to and collects in the opening <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> where the feed flows into the y-joint <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The flexible hose <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is manually extended to and placed in receiving position in an elevated feed hopper. The flexible material of the flexible hose <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> allows the hose to be raised, lowered, and/or located in various elevations to supply feeder hoppers of varying elevations. A self powered air movement device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> or blower is attached to the air supply pipe <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Once the seal has been made between the air supply pipe <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and the air wand reducer/seal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the user will then start the air movement device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The position of the exit end of the air supply pipe <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is manipulated longitudinally within the y-joint <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> by the operator to control the feed conveyance. The feed is conveyed through the barrel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> into the flexible hose <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and discharged into the elevated feeder. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Conclusion, Ramifications, and Scope </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The reader will see that this Speed Feed delivery system can be used to efficiently supply or load an elevated feed hopper. The present invention is of relative light weight, convenient, easily assembled, conveniently stored, and practical. In addition, the system focuses on providing a compact and effective system for the filling elevated hoppers. Furthermore, the Speed Feed delivery system has additional advantages in that </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> it permits an immediate delivery of feed to differing heights via the flexible hose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> it permits a user to efficiently fill successive feeder hoppers as the system can be transported on the bed of a pickup truck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> it provides a rapid and efficient feed flow for filling a feed hopper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> it provides the user with a safe alternative to climbing a ladder with a heavy feed bucket or bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> it requires limited storage space due to its compact size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> it requires a safe range of lifting for filling the loading hopper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> While the above description contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification of one preferred embodiment thereof For example, the method of dispensing the feed via the flexible hose can be modified to include varying lengths, rigidity, or other similar means. The loading hopper can be modified in shape, size, construction material, or design. The supporting leg structures may be modified with wheels including a wheel locking mechanism. These potential alternative modifications have been anticipated, however, they are not consider important enough to be shown in the drawing and or detailed description sections. </paragraph>
