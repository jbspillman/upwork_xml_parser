<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to coating systems suitable for protecting components exposed to high-temperature environments, such as the hot gas flow path through a gas turbine engine. More particularly, this invention is directed to a multilayer thermal barrier coating (TBC) system characterized by a low coefficient of thermal conductivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The use of thermal barrier coatings (TBC) on components such as combustors, high pressure turbine (HPT) blades and vanes is increasing in commercial as well as military gas turbine engines. The thermal insulation of a TBC enables such components to survive higher operating temperatures, increases component durability, and improves engine reliability. TBC is typically a ceramic material deposited on an environmentally-protective bond coat to form what is termed a TBC system. Bond coat materials widely used in TBC systems include oxidation-resistant overlay coatings such as MCrAlX (where M is iron, cobalt and/or nickel, and X is yttrium or another rare earth element), and oxidation-resistant diffusion coatings such as diffusion aluminides that contain aluminum intermetallics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Ceramic materials and particularly binary yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) are widely used as TBC materials because of their high temperature capability, low thermal conductivity, and relative ease of deposition by air plasma spraying (APS), flame spraying and physical vapor deposition (PVD) techniques. TBC&apos;s formed by these methods have a lower thermal conductivity than a dense ceramic of the same composition as a result of the presence of microstructural defects and pores at and between grain boundaries of the TBC microstructure. TBC&apos;s employed in the highest temperature regions of gas turbine engines are often deposited by electron beam physical vapor deposition (EBPVD), which yields a columnar, strain-tolerant grain structure that is able to expand and contract without causing damaging stresses that lead to spallation. Similar columnar microstructures can be produced using other atomic and molecular vapor processes, such as sputtering (e.g., high and low pressure, standard or collimated plume), ion plasma deposition, and all forms of melting and evaporation deposition processes (e.g., cathodic arc, laser melting, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In order for a TBC to remain effective throughout the planned life cycle of the component it protects, it is important that the TBC has and maintains a low thermal conductivity throughout the life of the component, including high temperature excursions. However, the thermal conductivities of TBC materials such as YSZ are known to increase over time when subjected to the operating environment of a gas turbine engine. As a result, TBC&apos;s for gas turbine engine components are often deposited to a greater thickness than would otherwise be necessary. Alternatively, internally cooled components such as blades and nozzles must be designed to have higher cooling flow. Both of these solutions are undesirable for reasons relating to cost, component life and engine efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, it can be appreciated that further improvements in TBC technology are desirable, particularly as TBC&apos;s are employed to thermally insulate components intended for more demanding engine designs. A TBC with lower thermal conductivity would allow for higher component surface temperatures or reduced coating thickness for the same surface temperature. Reduced TBC thickness, especially in applications like combustors which require relatively thick TBC&apos;s, would result in a significant cost reduction as well as weight benefit. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a thermal barrier coating (TBC) and method by which a low thermal conductivity of the TBC is maintained or even decreased as a result of a post-deposition high temperature exposure. The TBC is part of a TBC system that includes a bond coat by which the TBC is adhered to a component surface. The TBC of this invention preferably comprises an inner layer on the bond coat and an insulating layer overlying the inner layer. According to one aspect of the invention, the inner layer preferably contains yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), while the insulating layer contains barium strontium aluminosilicate (BSAS; (Ba<highlight><subscript>1&excl;x</subscript></highlight>Sr<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>)O&mdash;Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) The thermal conductivity (T<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>) of BSAS is approximately equal to that of YSZ. However, the thermal conductivity of BSAS has been surprisingly observed to decrease with sufficiently high temperature exposures, with the result that, though having similar as-deposited thermal conductivities, BSAS can become a better thermal insulator than YSZ if it undergoes an appropriate thermal treatment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Because BSAS has a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) (about half that of YSZ), and therefore a BSAS coating may not adequately adhere directly to a metal substrate. In addition, alumina (Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>) scale that forms on aluminum-containing bond coats may react with the silica content of the BSAS coating to form silicate-type phases that would further diminish the adhesion of the coating. Therefore, the present invention provides the YSZ-containing inner layer, which has a sufficiently high CTE to mitigate the CTE mismatch between the BSAS-containing insulating layer and the underlying metal substrate (e.g., bond coat). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, the present invention provides a TBC with a low-T<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>outer coating (BSAS) whose thermal conductivity is reduced from its as-deposited T<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>through an intentional high temperature thermal treatment. While not wishing to be held to any particular theory, the thermal conductivity of BSAS is believed to decrease with temperature exposure as a result of grain shape changes driven by the surface energy reduction, which causes pores to form in the BSAS coating. The resulting porosity decreases the thermal conductivity of the BSAS coating, with the result that the BSAS coating has significantly lower thermal conductivity than a conventional YSZ coating of the same thickness. As a result, a TBC containing a BSAS insulating layer in accordance with this invention is particularly suitable for thermally insulating components intended for demanding applications, including advanced gas turbine engines in which higher component surface temperatures are required. Alternatively, the lower thermal conductivity of the TBC allows for reduced coating thicknesses for the same surface temperature, resulting in a significant cost reduction as well as weight benefit. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention is generally applicable to components subjected to high temperatures, and particularly to components such as the high and low pressure turbine vanes (nozzles) and blades (buckets), shrouds, combustor liners and augmentor hardware of gas turbine engines. The invention provides a thermal barrier coating (TBC) system suitable for protecting those surfaces of a gas turbine engine component that are subjected to hot combustion gases. While the advantages of this invention will be described with reference to gas turbine engine components, the teachings of the invention are generally applicable to any component on which a TBC may be used to protect the component from a high temperature environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> TBC systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in accordance with three embodiments of this invention are represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference>. In each embodiment, the TBC system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is shown as including a metallic bond coat <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that overlies the surface of a substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the latter of which is typically a superalloy and the base material of the component protected by the TBC systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As is typical with TBC systems for gas turbine engine components, the bond coat <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably an aluminum-rich composition, such as an overlay coating of an MCrAlX alloy or a diffusion coating such as a diffusion aluminide or a diffusion platinum aluminide of a type known in the art. Aluminum-rich bond coats of this type develop an aluminum oxide (alumina) scale <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which is grown by oxidation of the bond coat <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The alumina scale <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> chemically bonds a multilayer TBC <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> to the bond coat <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The TBC&apos;s <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are only schematically represented. As known in the art, one or more of the individual layers of the TBC&apos;s <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> may have a strain-tolerant microstructure of columnar grains as a result of being deposited by a physical vapor deposition technique, such as EBPVD. Alternatively, one or more of the layers may have a noncolumnar structure as a result of being deposited by such methods as plasma spraying, including air plasma spraying (APS). Layers of this type are in the form of molten &ldquo;splats,&rdquo; resulting in a microstructure characterized by irregular flattened grains and a degree of inhomogeneity and porosity. In each case, the process by which the layers of the TBC <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> are deposited provides microstructural defects and pores that are believed to decrease the thermal conductivity of the TBC <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides compositions and structures for the TBC&apos;s <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> that further reduce thermal conductivity as a result of including a layer that contains barium strontium aluminosilicate (BSAS; (Ba<highlight><subscript>1&minus;x</subscript></highlight>Sr<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>)O&mdash;Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&mdash;SiO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) Similar to YSZ, BSAS is not volatile in water vapor at high temperatures, and therefore would be expected to be capable of surviving the hostile environment of the hot gas path within a gas turbine engine. However, while preliminary data indicated that the thermal conductivity (T<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>) of BSAS is slightly lower than YSZ, the CTE of BSAS is about half that of YSZ. The T<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>and CTE data for YSZ and BSAS are summarized in Table 1 below (&ldquo;RT&rdquo; stands for &ldquo;room temperature,&rdquo; or about 25&deg; C.).

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Because BSAS has a significant CTE mismatch with metal surfaces, a BSAS coating would be expected to be prone to spallation from the bond coat <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or metal substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Another problem with the use of BSAS in a TBC system is that the alumina scale <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that forms on the surface of the bond coat <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> would be expected to have a tendency to react with the silica content of a BSAS coating, forming silicate-type phases that could promote interface degradation and failure from thermal fatigue. In view of these concerns, and because BSAS would be expected to provide only a modest improvement in thermal insulation, BSAS has not been utilized as a thermal-insulating layer for high temperature (e.g., gas turbine engine) applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Notwithstanding the above concerns, the present invention provides several different approaches to incorporating a BSAS-containing layer into the TBC systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of this invention. Contrary to the thermal data of Table 1, it was unexpectedly determined that the thermal conductivity of BSAS actually decreases with prolonged exposures to elevated temperatures. In one investigation, the thermal conductivity of air plasma sprayed (APS) BSAS coatings was measured in the as-deposited condition, after aging for about five hours at about 1482&deg; C., and after aging for about fifty hours at about 1482&deg; C. The measurements were made at temperatures of about 820&deg; C., 890&deg; C. and 990&deg; C. The averages of these measurements are summarized in Table 2 below. It should be noted that the conductivities of the as-deposited BSAS specimens in Table 2 are lower than the conductivity indicated in Table 1 because Table 1 is based on bulk BSAS at room temperature, while Table 2 is based on plasma sprayed BSAS at elevated temperatures.

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The above results indicated that a significant improvement in thermal insulation could be achieved by the incorporation of BSAS into a TBC if the BSAS coating was subjected to an appropriate thermal treatment. While not wishing to be held to any particular theory, the basis for the decreasing thermal conductivity of BSAS evident in Table 2 is believed to be related to increased porosity created as a result of changes in grain shape driven by surface energy reduction during high temperature excursions. Thermal treatments sufficient to significantly decrease the thermal conductivity of BSAS (i.e,. below about 1.5 w/mK) are generally believed to be at least about 1200&deg; C. if held for at least two hours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> On the basis of the above results, the present invention provides the several approaches represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference> for incorporating a BSAS-containing layer into the TBC systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the TBC <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is shown as comprising an inner layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> lying directly on the bond coat <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a single outer layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> lying directly on the inner layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A preferred composition for the inner layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is based on binary yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), a particular notable example of which contains about 6 to about 8 weight percent yttria, with the balance zirconia. Other zirconia-based ceramic materials could also be used with this invention, such as zirconia fully stabilized by yttria, nonstabilized zirconia, or zirconia partially or fully stabilized by ceria, magnesia, scandia and/or other oxides. According to one aspect of the invention, a particularly suitable material for the inner layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is YSZ containing about 4 to about 8 weight percent yttria (4-8% YSZ). In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the outer layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is entirely BSAS. According to a preferred aspect of the first embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the inner layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is deposited to a thickness that is sufficient to provide a suitable stress distribution within the TBC system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to promote the mechanical integrity of the coating. A suitable thickness for this purpose is generally on the order of about 3 to about 30 mils (about 75 to about 750 micrometers), which is also believed to be sufficient to provide a physical barrier to a possible reaction between the alumina scale <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the silica content of the BSAS outer layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The BSAS outer layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is sufficiently thick to provide the desired level of thermal insulation in combination with the YSZ inner layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. While coating thickness depends on the particular application, a thickness ratio of YSZ/BSAS of about one is believed to be suitable, such that a suitable thickness for the BSAS outer layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is also about 3 to about 30 mils (about 75 to about 750 micrometers). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the TBC <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> differs from the TBC <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> by having a multilayer outer coating <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. As before, an inner layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> lies directly on the bond coat <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the outer coating <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> lies directly on the inner layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. A preferred composition for the inner layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is again based on YSZ, preferably 3-20% YSZ. In contrast to the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the outer coating <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is formed to include a graded region of alternating thin YSZ and BSAS layers <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, respectively, followed by an outer layer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> formed entirely of YSZ. The YSZ layers <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> may have the same composition as the inner layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (3-20% YSZ), though it is foreseeable that their compositions could differ. For example, a higher yttria content may be desired in the outer YSZ layer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to improve high temperature phase stability, or a lower yttria content may be desired to improve erosion resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the YSZ inner layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> promotes stress distribution between the bond coat <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the TBC <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, the BSAS layers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> serve to reduce the overall thermal conductivity of the TBC <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, the YSZ outer layer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> promotes the erosion resistance of the TBC <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, and the thin YSZ layers <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> provide a grading effect between the BSAS layers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the YSZ inner and outer layers <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. As such, the YSZ inner layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can have a thickness similar to that of the YSZ inner layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The individual thin layers <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> preferably have thicknesses of about 2 mils (about 50 micrometers) for a combined thickness of about 10 to about 30 mils (about 250 to about 750 micrometers), though thicknesses of as little as 5 (about 125 micrometers) and as much as 50 (about 1250 micrometers) are foreseeable. The combined thickness of the BSAS layers <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> preferably constitutes at least about one-third of the combined thickness of the YSZ layers <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> in order for the TBC <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to contain sufficient BSAS to have a significant impact on heat transfer. Any number of YSZ and BSAS layers <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> can be combined to form the graded region of the outer coating <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. However, the layers <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are preferably arranged so that the layer contacting the YSZ inner layer <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is YSZ to promote mechanical compliance. The YSZ outer layer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> should be sufficiently thick to provide erosion protection to the graded layers <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. A suitable thickness for this purpose is generally on the order of up to about 10 mils (about 250 micrometers). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the TBC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> is similar to that of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> by the inclusion of a YSZ inner layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and a multilayer outer coating <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> that includes a YSZ outer layer <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. However, the TBC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> differs in that the outer coating <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> comprises a BSAS/YSZ composite layer <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> between the inner and outer YSZ layers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. A preferred composition for the composite layer <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is a uniform mixture of about 25 to about 75 weight percent BSAS, with the balance 4-8% YSZ. Equal parts of BSAS and YSZ in the composite layer <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> are believed to provide an adequate stress field. The stated range for the BSAS/YSZ ratio is believed to achieve stress distribution for varying relative thicknesses of the YSZ inner and outer layers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. A suitable thickness for the composite layer <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> is up to about 10 mils (about 250 micrometers), preferably about 4 to about 7 mils (about 100 to about 175 micrometers). The composition and thickness of the composite layer <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> provide a sufficient amount of BSAS to significantly lower the thermal conductivity of the TBC <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. For the same reasons discussed above, suitable thicknesses for the YSZ inner and outer layers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> are again up to about 10 mils (about 250 micrometers). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, it can be appreciated that each of the TBC systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of this invention employs a TBC <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> whose thermal conductivity is reduced by the addition of a constituent having a lower thermal conductivity than YSZ and other conventional TBC materials. Because a larger CTE mismatch exists with a metal bond coat <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> when BSAS is used as the low thermal conductivity material, each of the TBC&apos;s <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> includes an intermediate YSZ layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> that reduces the CTE mismatch. The TBC&apos;s <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> also employ an outer layer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> that is entirely or predominantly YSZ, whose erosion resistance properties are better than BSAS and conventional TBC materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in terms of a preferred embodiment, it is apparent that other forms could be adopted by one skilled in the art. Therefore, the scope of the invention is to be limited only by the following claims. </paragraph>
