<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for computed tomographic (CT) imaging and other scanning imaging systems, and more particularly, to methods and apparatus for decreasing image artifacts and for retaining spatial resolution in systems providing increased volume coverage with limited data acquisition hardware. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> To reduce the total scan time required for multiple slices, a &ldquo;helical&rdquo; scan may be performed. To perform a &ldquo;helical&rdquo; scan, the patient is moved in a z-axis direction synchronously with the rotation of the gantry, while the data for the prescribed number of slices is acquired. Such a system generates a single helix from a fan beam helical scan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In at least one known CT imaging system, the detector array is segmented into a plurality of rows of detector elements, each row extending in an x-direction and defining an x-y &ldquo;slice&rdquo; out of a volume. Such imaging systems can acquire and process a plurality of slices of projection data to construct a plurality of images. Each of the reconstructed images corresponds to a different slice though the volume. Such CT imaging systems are referred to as &ldquo;multislice&rdquo; systems. Multislice systems provide more data available for reconstructing an image. In one exemplary embodiment of a multislice imaging system, N rows, e.g., N slices, of projection data are acquired for each view angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> At least one known CT imaging system utilizes a detector array and a &ldquo;data acquisition system&rdquo; (DAS) for collecting image data. The detector array includes detector elements that individually produce an analog intensity signal representing impinging x-ray energy. The analog signals are then converted by the DAS to digital signals, which are used to produce image data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In many applications of CT imaging systems such as cardiac imaging, it is desirable to increase the volume of an object imaged during a gantry rotation. One method for increasing imaging volume is to increase z-axis detector coverage, for example, by increasing the number of detector rows. To accommodate a larger number of detector rows without substantially increasing the size and complexity of the DAS, adjacent groups of detector elements in a detector row can be ganged. &ldquo;Ganging groups of detector elements&rdquo; (also called &ldquo;ganging detector channels&rdquo;) refers to combining outputs of more than one detector cell adjacent one another in the x-direction. A detector having ganged detector elements requires less bandwidth than the same size detector array having separate detector outputs. Each ganged group of detector elements produces an output that requires only a communication path or channel through the DAS equivalent to that required by a single, unganged detector output. For example, a ganged group of detector elements produces data that can be sent via one multiplexed data slot position. Spare detector channels of the DAS can then be used to increase the number of detector rows from which data is acquired. When increased volume coverage is not needed, the channels and detector elements can be &ldquo;unganged&rdquo; or used individually. In this mode, the DAS accommodates the same amount of data, but processes fewer detector rows, so that less z-axis coverage is provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Ganging of adjacent detector elements in a detector row allows a hardware-limited imaging system to provide increased volume coverage. However, computer simulations of phantom scans has shown that ganging of detector elements in this manner results in a significant loss of spatial resolution and in increased aliasing artifact levels. Attempts to improve spatial resolution by boosting the image reconstruction kernel have resulted in worsened aliasing. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a scanning imaging system, represented by computed tomography (CT) imaging system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is shown including a rotating gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> representative of a &ldquo;third generation&rdquo; CT scanner. An x-ray source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (e.g., an x-ray tube) on rotating gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> emits a fan-shaped beam of x-rays <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in an x-y plane toward a detector array <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> on the opposite side of gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Detector array <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (often referred to simply as a &ldquo;detector&rdquo;), also on rotating gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is formed by detector elements or cells <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that together sense the projected x-rays that pass through an object, such as a medical patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Each detector element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> produces an electrical signal that represents the intensity of an impinging x-ray beam and hence the attenuation of the beam as it passes through object or patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. During a scan to acquire x-ray projection data, gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the components mounted thereon rotate about a center of rotation <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Detector array <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is a multislice detector array having detector elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> arranged in parallel rows, only one of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The parallel rows extend in and define an x-direction. Thus, projection data corresponding to a plurality of parallel slices can be acquired simultaneously during a scan. When increased z-axis coverage (and thus, volume coverage) is desired during a scan, outputs from pairs of adjacent detector elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are electrically combined to produce a single output signal per combined pair or detector element outputs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Rotation of gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the operation of x-ray source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are governed by a control mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of CT system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Control mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes an x-ray controller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that provides power and timing signals to x-ray source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a gantry motor controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that controls the rotational speed and position of gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A data acquisition system (DAS) <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in control mechanism <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> samples analog data from detector elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and converts the data to digital signals for subsequent processing. Each digital signal representing a detector output is transmitted by DAS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to image reconstructor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which receives the sampled and digitized x-ray data via separate channels and performs high speed image reconstruction. In one embodiment, each channel corresponds to a recurring time slot in one of a plurality of multiplexed signal paths. The reconstructed image is applied as an input to a computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that stores the image in a mass storage device <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> also receives commands and scanning parameters from an operator via console <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that has a keyboard. An associated cathode ray tube display <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> allows the operator to observe the reconstructed image and other data from computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The operator supplied commands and parameters are used by computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to provide control signals and information to DAS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, x-ray controller <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and gantry motor controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In addition, computer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> operates a table motor controller <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that controls a motorized table <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to position patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Particularly, table <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> moves portions of patient <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through gantry opening <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> When increased z-axis coverage is desired, outputs from combined pairs of detector elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are ganged. By rearranging electrical connections in DAS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the same number of DAS <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> channels can process data from a greater number of detector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> rows because the ganging of detector element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> outputs results in fewer signals being produced per detector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> row. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, imaging system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is configured to perform axial scans. In another embodiment, imaging system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is configured to perform helical scans. In one embodiment, imaging system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is selectively configurable to perform either an axial or a helical scan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, a quarter-quarter offset (also known as a detector quarter offset or &ldquo;QQ&rdquo;) is used to double the sampling density and an image reconstruction algorithm having a kernel (a &ldquo;standard reconstruction kernel&rdquo;) with a cut-off frequency of half of the Nyquist spatial sampling rate is used to process the double density data. An &ldquo;iso-center&rdquo; of CT imaging system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is defined as the center of rotation <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of gantry <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> &ldquo;iso-channel&rdquo; is defined by an intersection of detector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with a straight line passing through the iso-center and a focal spot of x-ray beam <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. To combat aliasing, a location of a center detector element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of detector array <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is offset by &frac14; of the detector element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> width to the iso-channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a representation of quarter-quarter offset for unganged detector elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of a single row of detector array <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows four detector elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a single row at the center of detector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Detector elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are shown at a first position (top row) <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at 0&deg; gantry rotation and at a second position (bottom row) <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> at 180&deg; gantry rotation. An effective data channel position <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of each detector element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is represented by &ldquo;x&rdquo; in the center of each element. Referring in particular to detector element <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, at 0&deg; gantry rotation, iso-channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is offset to the right by &frac14; of the width of detector element <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> with respect to its effective data channel position. However, at 180&deg; gantry rotation <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, each element <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is offset by &frac12; of an element width. Thus, iso-channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, when scanning without ganging groups of detector elements, is offset by &frac14; element width to the left of detector element <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The distance between the detector element <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> positions between gantry angles 0&deg; and 180&deg; is one-half element width, which allows sampling at mid-position between two detector elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and effectively doubles the sampling rate of a single projection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a representation of detector array <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> showing pairs <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or groups of adjacent detector elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> ganged together in the x-direction, to increase a volume of an object <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> scanned to acquire projection data. As in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, position <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> represents detector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the 0&deg; gantry rotation position and position <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> represents detector array <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the 180&deg; gantry position. Effective sampling positions <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for each paired combination <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are now exactly halfway between individual elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The distance of the closest paired combination <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> sampling position <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to iso-channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is now &frac38; of a paired combination <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> width. The 180&deg; gantry position conjugate sample is now &frac34; detector cell away from the previous position at 0&deg; gantry position. Although two samples are still obtained within each paired combination width (one at each position <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for each combination <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>), the second sample no longer straddles the previous sampling positions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, to combat aliasing artifacts and to increase image resolution, detector iso-channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is realigned or adjusted after cell ganging. In one embodiment, double-ganged detector elements are used for scanning with a quarter-quarter offset. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the focal spot of x-ray beam <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is shifted or deflected so that a new iso-channel <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is shifted &frac14; detector element width. (This shift is relative the position of iso-channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>.) In this embodiment, the offset distance between the conjugate samples is now &frac12; the width of a double-ganged group <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of detector elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. An image of an object scanned with the ganged detector elements is reconstructed utilizing projection data acquired in the scan and the adjusted iso-channel <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, which is different from iso-channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> prior to ganging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Iso-channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is realigned to a new iso-channel <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> by x-ray focal spot deflection (e.g., magnetic or electrostatic deflection, such as in x-ray source tube <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> itself) or by a mechanical adjustment. In one embodiment employing mechanical adjustment, X-ray controller <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> includes additional components to control a motor <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> mechanically coupled to x-ray source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The adjustment or realignment of iso-channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is by an amount effect to reduce artifacts in the reconstructed image. In one embodiment, iso-channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is shifted to a new iso-channel <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> by &frac18; of the width of a ganged group of detector elements. In one embodiment, rather than shifting x-ray source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, an equivalent iso-channel adjustment is made by mechanically shifting detector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> For certain types of examinations, detector elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can remain double-ganged during the entire examination. Therefore, there is no need to make dynamic adjustments of iso-channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> during these examinations. Focal spot deflection (or mechanical shift) is performed only once before the examination if needed, and once after the examination, if required for a subsequent examination or if it is desired to return the focal spot to a standard position after each examination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Reconstructing an image of the object <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> utilizing acquired projection data and an adjusted iso-channel <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of multislice detector array <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> different from a first iso-channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is possible without physical adjustment of detector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and x-ray beam <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> configuration. In one embodiment, an original sampling configuration (for example, the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) is kept. Rather than deflecting x-ray beam <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, an adjustment is made to effect an iso-channel adjustment in the backprojection to combat aliasing. A &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; adjusted iso-channel <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> results that is different from iso-channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The adjustment is somewhat similar to adjustments used to effect an adjustment for a misaligned CT system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. However, rather than assuming that the iso-channel is at an oppositely biased position during reconstruction as for adjustments of misaligned systems, the present invention sets a reconstruction iso-channel a fraction of the difference between the actual position <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) and an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; position <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). Thus, the adjustment is made in an opposite direction from that which would be made were the adjustment made for misalignment rather than for alising correction. In one embodiment, a backprojection is performed on the acquired projection data utilizing an selected, adjusted iso-channel <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> offset from an unganged iso-channel of detector array <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Adjusted iso-channel <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is selected so as to be offset from the first, unganged iso-channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by at least a portion of the distance between first iso-channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and an iso-channel offset by &frac12; of the width of a double-ganged group <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of detector elements <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, a backprojection is performed on acquired projection data, and the iso-channel of the detector array is adjusted in the backprojection by an amount effective to reduce artifacts in the resulting image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to minimize the effect of iso-channel <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> adjustment on spatial resolution and to reduce the number of mathematical operations required. Therefore, in one embodiment of the present invention and referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, no interpolation is performed prior to filtering, so that filtering is performed on uninterpolated projection data. The ganged-cell projections are padded with zeros <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to avoid inter-period interference and then filtered <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> with a kernel having a cutoff frequency nearly twice the Nyquist spatial sampling frequency of the ganged detector. By &ldquo;nearly twice,&rdquo; it is meant that the cutoff frequency is between 1.6 and 2.0 times the Nyquist spatial sampling frequency. For example, in one embodiment, the cutoff frequency is 1.8 times the Nyquist spatial sampling frequency. Frequency domain interpolation <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is then performed during the filtering step by padding more zeros <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to the filtered projections prior to performing an inverse-Fourier transform <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A computer simulation was used to test the effectiveness of the present invention. For this study, simulated scans of a dense wire 0.2 mm in diameter were simulated, assuming the scanning geometry of General Electric Medical Systems, Inc. CT/i Imaging System. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the resulting reconstructed image of the thin wire using direct double channel ganging without adjustment of the iso-channel. The cutoff frequency for the filter kernel is 1.8 times the Nyquist spatial frequency of the ganged cell. No polynomial boost was performed. A resulting aliasing artifact is clearly evident in the reconstructed image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Next, a computer simulation was performed in which the x-ray focal spot was shifted by &frac14; of a single cell width to enable double sampling. The reconstruction process was identical to the one used to produce <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. The resulting image, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, illustrates the reduction in aliasing artifacts that is achievable with embodiments of the present invention. An actual measurement of a wire using a CT/i Imaging System (available from General Electric Medical Systems, Inc., Milwaukee, Wis.) was performed to determine the effect of embodiments of the present invention on spatial resolution impact. The measured curves are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Double-ganging without iso-channel readjustment is shown by a thick gray line <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, while double-ganging with realignment is shown by a solid line <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Performance was found to be quite comparable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Next, a computer simulation was performed to show the effect of introducing an iso-channel bias. In this simulation, the iso-channel for the backprojection was moved by &frac18; of a detector cell. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, aliasing artifacts are significantly reduced as compared to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, although the artifact is somewhat higher than <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, an actual measurement of a wire (dotted line <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>) shows a slight loss of spatial resolution. </paragraph>
