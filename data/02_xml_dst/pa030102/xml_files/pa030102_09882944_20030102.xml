<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to athletic bras and in particular to bras that prevent discomfort, pain and injury of some women from breast bounce. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Sports bras are well known and highly developed. However, like conventional brassieres, none prevent breast bounce adequately. This lack of adequate bounce prevention appears to result from primary concern about aesthetic breast adornment without due regard for bounce prevention caused by vigorous running, jumping, exercising, playing games, dancing, physical work, fighting and other dynamic activities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> No known prior art describes or teaches a breast-top barrier to upward movement for preventing breast bounce in a manner taught by this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Examples of most-closely related known but different bras are described in the following patent documents:

<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The Corrado patent describes a chest dressing with a flexible bandage-material band on breasts of post-operative breast-surgery patients, but comprehensively limited it from having structure, elasticity or resilience pressure that would impede any breast bounce whatsoever. A single breast movement would distort the bandage-material flexibility. It provides only sedentary breast protection that is completely opposite from breast protection from dynamic body action. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Like most shoulder-strap athletic bras, the cited Ekins patent has breast-top restriction with shoulder straps. This leaves a bounce gap between a strap and base portions of breasts, which requires cup fitting and tie-down that are further different. Fundamentally, bras with shoulder straps mostly press inwardly without restricting upwardly bouncing movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention should become even more readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings wherein there is shown and described illustrative embodiments of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Objects of patentable novelty and utility taught by this invention are to provide a breast-bounce inhibitor which: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> prevents upward movement of breasts for preventing breast bounce from vigorous body activity; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> can be worn for separate bounce prevention in combination with conventional athletic or non-athletic bras; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> can be built integrally into an athletic bra for two-way bounce prevention; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> can have resilience-pressure adjustment independently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> This invention accomplishes these and other objectives with a breast-bounce inhibitor having a bounce-prevention strap articulated for suspension laterally over tops of a woman&apos;s breasts and having bounce-resistant resilience intermediate back-strap attachments. The bounce-resistant resilience can be adjustable and the bounce-prevention strap can be joinable intermediate the breasts. A back strap can include a conventional bra strap. Bottom bounce-prevention structure with coacting bounce prevention can be included.</paragraph>
