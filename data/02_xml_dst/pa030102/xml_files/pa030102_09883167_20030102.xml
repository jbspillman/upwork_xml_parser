<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to model-based predictive control technology for boiler control.

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The classical approach to combustion air control is to use the measurement of oxygen concentration in flue gas for feedback control of the amount of combustion air. This reactive approach does not guarantee exact air-fuel ration during fast transients. While the standard air-fuel interlock provides acceptable steady-state performance, the solution based on conventional controllers may not be fully satisfactory during the transients, e.g. for boilers operating in cycling regimes, particularly if low-NO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>burning with reduced excess air is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Lang U.S. Pat. No. 5,367,470 is one of many patents describing the method of analyzing combustion for improved performance, in this case focusing on repetitive adjustment of assumed water concentration in the fuel until actual and calculated values for efficiency reach steady state. Okazaki et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,764,535 uses two-dimensional or three-dimensional cells in a furnace as part of a system employing a gas composition table to simplify the calculation Carter. U.S. Pat. No. 5,794,549 employs a plurality of burners to form a fireball to optimize combustion. Likewise, Khesin U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,946 converts a fluctuational component of a signal to an extreme point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Chappell et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,520,123 and Donais et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,626,085 both disclose systems relating to NO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, using oxygen injection into an afterburner and windbox-to-furnace ratios, respectively. Waltz U.S. Pat. No. 5,091,844 and Blumenthal et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,450 both relate to methodology for control relating to sensor feedback. Finally Stevers et al U.S. Pat. No. 5,501,159 teaches the use of a jacketed vessel with multiple chambers and air flows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> None of the prior art recognizes the potential for application of model-based predictive control technology for boiler control that will enable tight dynamic coordination of selected controlled variables, particularly the coordination of air and fuel during the transients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It would be of great advantage in the art if predictive control technology could be developed that would take into account relatively fast dynamics of boilers and rate limits imposed by the plant life-time considerations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It would be another great advance in the art if a system could be developed that would focus on power and heat generation to use predictive control technology and rate optimal control to have tight dynamic coordination of selected control variables to result in improved boiler efficiency and reduced NO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>production. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It has now been discovered that the above and other objects of the present invention may be accomplished in the following manner. Specifically, the present invention employs inferential sensing to estimate the total amount of combustion air for predictive control of air-fuel ratios for pulverized-coal fired boilers and other boiler systems using other fuels. The invention is useful for any fuel burning system, and has been found to be particularly suited for pulverized coal burning boilers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Using the estimate of the relation between the total air in the boiler rather than just the measured combustion air added to the boiler, the amount of air can be controlled by a predictive controller. The air to fuel ratio is accomplished in fast transients since the system does not have to wait for real-time feedback from analysis of the exhaust gases. The present invention allows the system to use minimum necessary excess air, thus providing low NO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>. Production and increased efficiency by at least one percent. The invention contemplates the use of what is termed cautious optimization (cautious optimization is related to the uncertainty in CO and NOx), in which the uncertainty of air entering the system from sources other than directly controlled and measured input is inferentially sensed or estimated from the concentration of O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>measured in the flue gasses, which represents all of the air in the boiler. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The controller system of this invention is based on predictive control technology. Taking into account relatively fast dynamics of boilers and rate limits imposed by the plant life-time considerations, the present invention focuses on power and heat generation applications. The basic idea behind the use of predictive control technology and rate optimal control (ROC) is to enable tight dynamic coordination of selected controlled variables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A typical application of the MIMO ROC controller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> for pressure control with simultaneous combustion (air/fuel ratio) optimization is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, where air and fuel are inputted into a boiler <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the fuel (pulverized coal) input <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and primary air input <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are controlled by controller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In addition to these two essential factors that make up the air to fuel ratio of the boiler, secondary air dynamics input <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and, when appropriate, tertiary air dynamics input <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are used as part of the control of the boiler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Besides the controlled and measured air (the sum of measured primary, secondary and tertiary air are those sources of air around the boiler other than the intentionally introduced air, they represent air that is pulled into the boiler at joints, junctions and other mechanical portions of the boiler. It has been discovered that measurement of the total air in the system is essential for optimum control of the combustion process. While it is not possible or practical to measure air as it is pulled into the boiler, it is relatively easy to measure the amount of air exiting the boiler in flue <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> as part of the flue gasses. These flue gasses contain quantities of CO and NO<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, as well as O<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, as noted at sensor <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Controller <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> calculates the total amount of air in the combustion process. From the total air in combustion and the known air input via measured air input <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, values for additional, or sucked-in air coming in can be calculated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Based on the data obtained and calculated, the controlled portions of the air to fuel ratio, fuel input <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and total air <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are adjusted to reflect this calculated additional amount of air illustrated at <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to optimize the combustion, producing less NO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>and increasing the efficiency of the boiler by significant amounts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the present invention, experiments were performed on a commercial boiler. Performance tests were performed on a commercial boiler system using pulverized coal as a fuel, producing superheated steam at a nominal flow of 125 tons per hour. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Presented below in Tables I and II are the results of test before and after the present invention was implemented. The constants were the boiler itself, the fuel as pulverized coal (adjusted for moisture content) from commercial sources, and the control equipment used to adjust the air to fuel ratio. The variable was the use of a sensor to determine oxygen excess in the flue gas, which in turn was used by the control equipment to adjust the air to fuel ratio to include all air rather than input air.
