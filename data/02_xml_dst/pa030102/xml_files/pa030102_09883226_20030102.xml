<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a removable bezel for personal computer, especially to a bezel fastened by bolts on the inner side thereof hooked with lock sockets on the chassis of the personal computer for easy assembling and removing of the bezel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The general housing of computer includes a chassis, a cover and a bezel. A disk bay is installed in the front side of the chassis for accommodating various kind of disk devices such as FDD (floppy disk drive), HDD (hard disk drive), CDROM (compact disk read-only memory) and removable HDD. The motherboard is disposed on the frame inside the housing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When disposing various kind of disk devices, each disk device is inserted through the bezel and put into the disk bay. Screws are used on two lateral sides of the disk bay for fastening the disk device. The front side of the disk device is integrated into the bezel and become part of the bezel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The general way for fixing the bezel is by screws or by a plurality of protruding rods mounted on the inner surface of the bezel melt into rivet shape after being inserting through the hole on the chassis. While the bezel fastened on the chassis by these ways is inconvenient for assembling and removing, not only laborious but also time-consuming. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> &amp; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the present invention is composed of a chassis <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> mounted in the front side of a bezel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A plurality of slots <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is arranged on the inner side of the bezel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Corresponding to each slot, a bolt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inserted into the slot <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A plurality of rectangular hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is installed in the front side of the chassis <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the location corresponding to the bolt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for accommodating lock sockets <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. According to the structure above, the bezel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected with the chassis <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> firmly by the bolt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> on the inner surface of the chassis <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> hooked with the lock socket <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on the front side of the chassis <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Since the bezel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is fastened by the bolt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> hooked with the lock socket <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the bezel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be pulled out from the chassis <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> directly for easy assembling and removing. Thus the manufacturing cost is reduced and the products are more competitive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the bolt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> includes an inserted board <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on the bottom side thereof, and a hook <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> installed on the lateral side of the inserted board <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. A pin <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is arranged on the lateral side of the slot <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on the bezel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The inserted board <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on the bottom of the bolt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is inserted into the slot <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on the bezel <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the hook <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> on the lateral side of the inserted board <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is hooked with the pin <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> on the lateral side of the slot <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Thus the bolt <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is fastened on the slot <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> With reference of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the lock socket <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is &OHgr;-shaped with two flutes <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> arranged on two lateral sides respectively. The lock socket <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is installed on the rectangular hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by the two flutes <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> hooked with two lateral sides of the rectangular hole <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
