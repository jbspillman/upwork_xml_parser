<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to cryogenic air separation processes for the production of oxygen and nitrogen products, and in particular to processes for the production of nitrogen in quantities up to 40 mole % of the incoming air flow and the production of oxygen at a purity greater than 95 mole %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Many cryogenic air separation plants that supply oxygen as the main product also are required to produce some nitrogen. This requirement is common in various industries, such as steel production. In the well known double-column distillation configuration, nitrogen can be conveniently produced from either the lower pressure column or the higher pressure column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Producing nitrogen as a vapor from the top of the higher pressure column decreases the amount of nitrogen that can be condensed on the top of that column and thereby decreases the amount of boilup that is produced for the lower pressure column in the thermally integrated reboiler-condenser. This action can decrease the oxygen recovery and, therefore, can increase the power consumption of that process. The increase in power consumption is due to the increased air feed flow associated with a reduction in oxygen recovery. Much of the increase in power consumption is offset by reduced nitrogen compression power, which results from recovering the nitrogen product at a pressure essentially that of the higher pressure column. If, in addition to oxygen, the plant also is producing argon, then argon recovery also decreases due to the reduced boilup in the lowest section of the lower pressure column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> If nitrogen is produced as a vapor from the top of the lower pressure column, then the boilup in the lowest section of the lower pressure column is unaffected and high levels of both oxygen and argon recovery can be maintained. However, a nitrogen product compressor typically is required to boost the nitrogen product to the desired pressure. This increases both the capital investment and the power consumption of the process. If the nitrogen requirement is relatively high (e.g., nitrogen to-oxygen product ratio of more than 1.5), this may be the preferred option, as the oxygen recovery penalty for producing nitrogen from the higher pressure column becomes more significant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Japanese Pat. No. 07-270064 discloses a process aimed at nitrogen production from an oxygen plant with an argon column. A portion of the higher pressure column liquid nitrogen is reduced in pressure and vaporized to drive an intermediate-condenser located in the rectification section of the lower pressure column (above the point at which the oxygen-enriched stream from the higher pressure column is introduced). The nitrogen product is derived from the liquid vaporized in the intermediate-condenser. This nitrogen can be produced at a slightly higher pressure than the lower pressure column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,817,394 (Erickson) and 4,854,954 (Erickson) both disclose distillation systems where nitrogen is produced at a pressure greater than the lower pressure column by vaporizing a portion of higher pressure column liquid nitrogen in an intermediate-condenser attached to the argon column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> European Patent Application No. 0 639 746 (Sweeney) discloses an air separation process where a portion of the higher pressure column liquid nitrogen is vaporized to drive a condenser on top of the lower-pressure column to generate reflux for the lower-pressure column and to produce gaseous nitrogen product. In this case, the nitrogen is produced at a pressure less than that of the lower pressure column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is desired to have a process having a lower pressure column and a higher pressure column whereby nitrogen is produced from the process at a pressure greater than the pressure of the lower pressure column without reducing the boilup in the bottom section of the lower pressure column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is further desired to have a more efficient and improved process for the production of nitrogen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is still further desired to have a process for the production of nitrogen which overcomes the difficulties and disadvantages of the prior art to provide better and more advantageous results. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A modification of a typical two-column oxygen-producing cryogenic air separation process allows nitrogen production at a pressure between the pressures of the two columns by vaporizing liquid nitrogen product from the higher pressure column against a condensing lower pressure column stream. Such an arrangement increases oxygen recovery, thus reducing energy consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment of the invention is a process for separating air to produce an oxygen product and a nitrogen product. The process uses a distillation column system having at least two distillation columns, including a higher pressure column at a first pressure and a lower pressure column at a second pressure lower than the first pressure. The lower pressure column has a stripping section and is in thermal communication with the higher pressure column. Each of the distillation columns and the stripping section have a top, a bottom, and at least one intermediate location between the top and the bottom. The process includes multiple steps. The first step is to provide a stream of compressed air. The second step is to feed at least a portion of the stream of compressed air to the distillation column system. The third step is to withdraw a nitrogen-enriched liquid stream from the higher pressure column. The fourth step is to withdraw a vapor stream from the lower pressure column at an intermediate location of the stripping section of the lower pressure column. The fifth step is to heat exchange at least part of the vapor stream with at least part of the nitrogen-enriched stream, thereby at least partially condensing at least part of the vapor stream to form a condensate and at least partially vaporizing at least part of the nitrogen-enriched liquid stream to form a nitrogen-enriched vapor, at an intermediate pressure between the first pressure and the second pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> There are several variations of the first embodiment. In one variation, the nitrogen-enriched liquid stream is withdrawn from the top of the higher pressure column. In another variation, the nitrogen-enriched liquid is withdrawn from an intermediate location of the higher pressure column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In another variation of the first embodiment, at least a portion of the nitrogen-enriched vapor is withdrawn from the distillation column system as at least a portion of the nitrogen product. There are several variants of this variation. In one variant, the portion of the nitrogen product that is the nitrogen-enriched vapor is less than or equal to about 40 mole % of the stream of compressed air. In another variant, the nitrogen product has a third pressure between about 1.5 times the second pressure and about 0.9 times the first pressure. In another variant, the process includes an additional step of compressing the nitrogen-enriched vapor at a temperature near an ambient temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> There are several additional embodiments of the invention. One such embodiment is similar to the first embodiment but includes an additional step of feeding at least a portion of the condensate to the lower pressure column at or above the intermediate location. Another embodiment also is similar to the first embodiment but includes an additional step of feeding at least a portion of the condensate to an argon distillation column at or above the bottom of the argon distillation column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention is a process for separating air to produce an oxygen product and a nitrogen product using a distillation column system having at least three distillation columns, including a higher pressure column at a first pressure, a lower pressure column at a second pressure lower than the first pressure, and an additional column. The lower pressure column has a stripping section and is in thermal communication with the higher pressure column. Each of the distillation columns and the stripping section have a top, a bottom, and at least one intermediate location between the top and the bottom. The process includes multiple steps. The first step is to provide a stream of compressed air. The second step is to feed at least a portion of the stream of compressed air to the distillation column system. The third step is to withdraw a nitrogen-enriched liquid stream from the higher pressure column. The fourth step is to withdraw a vapor stream from the lower pressure column at an intermediate location of the stripping section of the lower pressure column. The fifth step is to feed a first part of the vapor stream to a feed location at or adjacent the bottom of the additional column. The sixth step is to heat exchange a second part of the vapor stream with at least part of the nitrogen-enriched liquid stream, thereby at least partially condensing at least part of the second part of the vapor stream to form a condensate and at least partially vaporizing at least part of the nitrogen-enriched liquid stream to form a nitrogen-enriched vapor, at an intermediate pressure between the first pressure and the second pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> There are several additional embodiments of the invention which are similar to the previously discussed embodiment but include an additional step. In one such embodiment, the additional step is to feed at least a portion of the condensate to the additional column. In another embodiment, the additional step is to feed at least a portion of the condensate to the lower pressure column at or above the intermediate location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is a cryogenic air separation unit using a process as in any of above described embodiments or variations thereof.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a cryogenic air separation process for the production of oxygen and nitrogen. The process consists of a distillation system that comprises at least a higher pressure column and a lower pressure column. A nitrogen-enriched liquid stream is recovered from the higher pressure column and is eventually at least partially vaporized by indirect heat exchange at a pressure intermediate that of the higher pressure column and the lower pressure column. A vapor stream is withdrawn from an intermediate location of the stripping section of the lower pressure column and at least partially condensed by indirect heat exchange with the nitrogen-enriched liquid stream. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;stripping section&rdquo; is defined to mean that section of a distillation column which resides below the location at which the feeds to that column are introduced. The associated term &ldquo;intermediate location&rdquo; is defined to mean a location which is not at the bottom. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present invention is applicable for the production of oxygen at a purity greater than 95 mole % and more preferably for the production of oxygen at a purity greater than 98 mole %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the practice of the present invention at least some of the nitrogen product may be recovered from the vapor that results from the at least partial vaporization of the nitrogen-enriched liquid. The present invention is appropriate for the production of nitrogen in such a manner in quantities up to 40 mole % of the incoming air flow. The present invention is particularly attractive if the pressure of the nitrogen product is required to be greater than approximately 1.5 times the pressure of the lower pressure column and less than approximately 0.9 times the pressure of the higher pressure column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The vapor stream which is withdrawn from an intermediate location of the stripping section of the lower pressure column typically contains less than 3 mole % nitrogen and less than 15 mole % argon, with the balance being primarily oxygen. After this vapor stream is at least partially condensed, it may be returned to the lower pressure column or alternatively, in the event that an argon column is associated with the process, it may be passed to the argon column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Feed air <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is compressed in main air compressor <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, purified in purifier <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and divided into three streams: stream <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, stream <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and stream <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Stream <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is, optionally, compressed in air booster <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, is partially cooled in main heat exchanger <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to form stream <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, which is expanded in air expander <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, and introduced to lower pressure column <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as feed <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Stream <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is partially cooled in main heat exchanger <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and then introduced into higher pressure column <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> as feed <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Stream <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is increased in pressure in air booster compressor <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. The resulting pressurized stream <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is cooled and at least partially condensed in main heat exchanger <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and introduced to higher pressure column <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> as stream <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Liquid stream <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, which typically has a composition similar to that of air, is removed from an intermediate location of the higher pressure column <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and eventually reduced in pressure across valve <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> and introduced into the lower pressure column <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as a feed. An oxygen-enriched stream <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is removed from the bottom of the higher pressure column and eventually reduced in pressure across valve <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> and introduced into the lower pressure column as an additional feed. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that other pressure reduction devices may be used in place of valve <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, including but not limited to dense fluid expanders and ejectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Higher pressure column overhead vapor stream <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is condensed in reboiler-condenser <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to produce liquid stream <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The heat rejected by the condensation provides boilup for the bottom of the lower pressure column <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. A portion of liquid stream <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> provides reflux for the higher pressure column <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Another portion, nitrogen-enriched liquid stream <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, is eventually reduced in pressure across valve <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and at least partially vaporized in heat exchanger <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. The pressure of vaporization is intermediate the pressure of the higher pressure column and the pressure of the lower pressure column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, heat exchanger <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> is enclosed in vessel <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> to facilitate the separation of vapor and liquid fractions. Heat exchanger <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and vessel <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> may be incorporated into the higher pressure or the lower pressure column design in a vertically stacked arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> That portion of the at least partially vaporized nitrogen-enriched stream which remains liquid is removed from vessel <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> as stream <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Stream <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is eventually reduced in pressure across valve <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> and introduced to the lower pressure column <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as a top feed. The vapor portion from vessel <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, stream <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>, is warmed in main heat exchanger <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and recovered as medium pressure gaseous nitrogen product <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The heat required to at least partially vaporize the nitrogen-enriched liquid stream <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and thereby produce vapor stream <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> is provided by at least partially condensing vapor stream <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the invention, stream <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is withdrawn from a location in lower pressure column <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> below the locations at which the lower pressure column feeds enter but above the bottom reboiler-condenser <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> of the lower pressure column. In other words, vapor stream <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is withdrawn from an intermediate location of the stripping section in the lower pressure column. Stream <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is at least partially condensed in heat exchanger <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> to form stream <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. Stream <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> is returned to the lower pressure column at a location at or above the location from which stream <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is withdrawn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Liquid oxygen is removed from the lower pressure column <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as stream <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, is raised in pressure by pump <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> to form stream <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, is vaporized and warmed in main heat exchanger <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and is recovered as gaseous oxygen product <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. Lower pressure column vapor overhead stream <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> is a waste stream that is warmed in the main heat exchanger and eventually vented into the atmosphere as stream <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the field of distillation, the condensation of a vapor stream from the stripping section of the lower pressure column (in the section below the column feeds) is counter to the conventional wisdom. Traditionally, intermediate-condensation is performed in the rectification section (in a section above the lowest feed). The present invention is able to depart from conventional practice due to the recognition that the stripping section of the lower pressure column is really performing two separations. In the lowest region of the stripping section, a relatively difficult oxygen-argon separation is taking place&mdash;a separation which requires a high level of boilup. As one moves up in the stripping section, a less difficult oxygen-nitrogen separation takes place and, consequently, less boilup is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates another embodiment of the invention. For brevity, streams in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> common to those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are omitted from the discussion below. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the application of the invention when the recovery of argon is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> An argon-enriched vapor is withdrawn from the stripping section of the lower pressure column <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as stream <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>. Stream <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> is split into two fractions: stream <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> and stream <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. Stream <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> is introduced to the bottom of the argon column <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Argon-enriched stream <highlight><bold>298</bold></highlight> is recovered off the top of the argon column <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Argon-depleted liquid stream <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> is returned to the lower pressure column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an oxygen-enriched stream <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is removed from the bottom of the higher pressure column <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. However, in this embodiment at least a portion of stream <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is eventually reduced in pressure across valve <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight> and at least partially vaporized to form stream <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. The vaporization energy is used to provide the refrigeration necessary to drive condenser <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of argon column <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, stream <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>, which is derived from a vapor stream <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> taken from an intermediate location of the stripping section in the lower pressure column <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, is at least partially condensed in heat exchanger <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> to form stream <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight>. Stream <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> is introduced to argon column <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> at a location at or above the location to which stream <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> is introduced; alternatively stream <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> may be returned to the lower pressure column at a location at or above the location from which stream <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> is withdrawn.

<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The efficacy of the present invention is best illustrated through an example. The process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is selected to represent the present invention. Prior art process 1 is the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> with heat exchanger <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> removed and nitrogen product recovered as a vapor from the higher pressure column <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Prior art process 2 is the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> with heat exchanger <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> removed and nitrogen product recovered as a vapor from the lower pressure column <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The basis of comparison is as follows: 1) oxygen product is produced at a pressure of 65 psia and purity of 99.5 mole % oxygen; 2) nitrogen product is recovered at a pressure of 35 psia, 55 psia, or 100 psia and a purity of 50 ppm oxygen&mdash;the flow of nitrogen is equal to the flow of oxygen; 3) crude argon product is recovered as a liquid at a purity of 2 mole % oxygen&mdash;the flow of argon is approximately 3% of the oxygen, this represents an argon recovery level of approximately 65%; and 4) the lower pressure column operates at approximately 18 psia at the top and the higher pressure column at approximately 72 psia at the top. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> For the comparison basis defined above, only prior art process 2 requires post compression of the nitrogen product if required at 35 psia or 55 psia; all three processes require post compression of nitrogen product if required at 100 psia.

<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> For producing nitrogen at 35 psia, the present invention saves 3.2% power compared to prior art process 1 and 0.7% power compared to prior art process 2. For producing nitrogen at 55 psia, the present invention saves 3.2% power compared to prior art process 1 and 5.2% power compared to prior art process 2. For producing nitrogen at 100 psia, the present invention saves 0.7% power compared to prior art-process 1 and 4.7% power compared to prior art process 2. Compression power includes the power to compress all the air feeds, plus the power to boost the nitrogen to delivery pressure (when required). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The results show that the present invention saves power over prior art process 1 even when the pressure of the nitrogen product exceeds that of the higher pressure column. The results also show that the present invention saves power over prior art process 2 when the pressure of the nitrogen product exceeds approximately twice that of the lower pressure column. Even in those cases where the power of prior art process 2 is less than that of the present invention (when nitrogen pressure is approximately less than 30 psia), the present invention has an advantage over prior art process 2 in that the costly compression machinery for the nitrogen product can be eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Numerous modifications or additions may be applied to the embodiments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> For example, the discussion has centered around processes that produce oxygen by pumping the oxygen liquid and vaporizing it in the main heat exchanger <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. However, persons skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention also is applicable when the liquid oxygen pressure is increased without the use of a pump <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> prior to vaporization. Furthermore, the oxygen product need not be vaporized in the main heat exchanger nor is it essential that pressurized air stream <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> be at least partially condensed&mdash;some other suitable pressurized stream may be employed. In addition, the oxygen product need not be withdrawn from the lower pressure column <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> as a liquid. Rather, the oxygen may be withdrawn from the lower pressure column as a vapor, in which event pressurized air stream <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> would not be necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In the preceding discussions, the liquefied air feed stream <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is shown to be directed to the higher pressure column <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Persons skilled in the art that will recognize some or all of the air feed stream <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> also may be sent to the lower pressure column <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. In such an event, liquid stream <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> would not be required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Refrigeration for the process has been illustrated by the expansion of a portion of air to the lower pressure column <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. However, persons skilled in the art will recognize that other refrigeration means exist. Examples include but are not limited to: 1) expansion of a portion of air to the higher pressure column <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>; 2) expansion of waste stream <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> from the lower pressure column; and 3) expansion of a vapor from the higher pressure column, such as a portion of stream <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, it is entirely feasible to expand vapor stream <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> in a turbo expander to provide some or all of the refrigeration required by the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In the discussion of the embodiments shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, reference is made to &ldquo;eventually reducing in pressure&rdquo;. It will be understood that this implies other processing steps may exist before the pressure reduction. For example, it is common practice to cool liquid streams prior to their introduction to the lower pressure column <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. This cooling is provided by warming cold returning vapor streams, such as stream <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The focus of the discussion has been on the production of a single oxygen product and a single nitrogen product. However, persons skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention also is applicable when multiple oxygen products and/or multiple nitrogen products are produced. Furthermore, these products need not be the same purity. With regard to multiple nitrogen products, one may elect to produce a portion of nitrogen from either or both of the higher pressure column <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and/or the lower pressure column <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in addition to the primary, intermediate pressure nitrogen product stream <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The reflux, or top feed, for the lower pressure column <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is shown as stream <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Other optional reflux streams exist. Examples include but are not limited to: 1) a liquid from an intermediate location of the higher pressure column <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>; and 2) a portion of liquid stream <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> (liquid from the top of the higher pressure column). In such an event, stream <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may or may not be optionally required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Nitrogen-enriched liquid stream <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is shown to be recovered from the top of the higher pressure column <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. It is within the scope of the present invention to remove stream <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> as a liquid from an intermediate location of the higher pressure column. Typically, this location will be above that point from which stream <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Although illustrated and described herein with reference to certain specific embodiments, the present invention is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown. Rather, various modifications may be made in the details within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims and without departing from the spirit of the invention. </paragraph>
