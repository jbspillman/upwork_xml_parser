<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention herein resides in the art of sealed bearings. In particular, the invention relates to a sealed bearing that prevents water or moisture-laden air from contacting the internal surfaces of the bearing. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Presently, some types of cleaning equipment are subjected to water or moisture. In particular, wet/dry vacuum cleaners, such as those known as utility vacs and carpet extractors, operate in an environment in which the debris that is extracted from the surface being cleaned is laden in a mixture of air and water. In order to prevent the moisture-laden air from entering the vacuum generating motor, bypass motors are typically used. As is well known, a bypass motor/fan assembly is one in which the working air, generated by a working air fan, is moved by the motor, but is totally isolated therefrom. The motor itself has a separate motor cooling air fan which draws cooling air over the motor&apos;s armature and field. In any event, the working air and the motor cooling air take totally separate paths and do not mix&mdash;except possibly in an exhaust area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Bypass motors typically have a working air fan at an end of a motor/fan shaft, with the fan rotating within a fan shell. One end of the fan shell has an air intake, with the circumference or periphery of the shell having a plurality of spaced-apart exhaust apertures or a tangential exhaust tube. The intake aperture communicates with a vacuum chamber in the cleaning device, while the exhaust ports communicate with the ambient air. The fan shell defines a chamber in which the fan rotates. Once that chamber becomes pressurized, the air therein eventually finds it way to the exhaust ports. Accordingly, the working air fan takes the moisture-laden air from the vacuum chamber and disperses it to the ambient air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It has been found, especially in applications where moisture is prevalent in the working air, that the moisture migrates into the motor housing and causes failures. In particular, these failures typically occur where the shaft is journaled within a bearing. The moisture contacts the bearing and eventually causes lubricating-grease degradation and loss, rust, and which, in turn, causes the bearing to fail and, in turn, the motor shaft to lock up and burn out the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There have been numerous design modifications attempted to prevent moisture from entering the bearing area. One modification utilizes a grease and/or oil-lubricated synthetic rubber seal disposed on the shaft between the airflow path and the bearing. The lubricant is required as the motor shaft typically rotates at very high speeds. But, the moisture-laden air may have a certain amount of very strong detergent that emulsifies the grease, drying out the lubricating material, and attacking the seal so that moisture eventually migrates along the shaft to the bearing. Moreover, the detergent mixes with the lubricating oil and is then exhausted out the ambient exhaust ports, causing dirt spots or oil spots on the floor upon which the cleaner is used. This is quite upsetting to the user and considered a major product failing of the cleaner. Accordingly, use of synthetic rubber seals as a bearing protection system has been found to be somewhat ineffective. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One attempt at overcoming the aforementioned problem is to employ expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) seals disposed on the shaft in place of a rubber seal. This general concept is disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 09/716,145 which is entitled &ldquo;Bearing Protection Assembly For Motors.&rdquo; This application is assigned to the Assignee of the present invention and is incorporated herein by reference. Although tests have shown the various embodiments disclosed in that application to be effective, the embodiments require added costs for caps to secure the seal and labor for clamping the seal in position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> There have also been attempts in the bearing art to improve the sealing properties of the bearing itself as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,480,235; 5,882,121; and 5,711,616. Generally, the sealing components in these disclosures have a rigid member that has molded thereto a flexible elastic sealing member that attempts to protect the rolling elements contained within the bearing. However, these elements are still susceptible to excessive wear, high temperatures and detergent contained in the moisture-laden air. Eventually these seals are rendered ineffective and break down in much the same manner as the seals positioned into contact with the shaft. Seals disposed on the shaft of the motor assembly or those that are part of the bearing&apos;s sealing component are typically made of rubber materials such as Neoprene. Neoprene is the generic name for polymers of chloroprene (CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>CHCCl&boxH;CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>; 2-chloro-1,3-butadiene). They are available as dry solids and latices, and are vulcanizable to tough products with good resistance to oil, solvents, heat and weathering. Neoprene rubber is a family of elastomers with a property profile that approaches that of natural rubber, but has better resistance to oils, ozone, oxidation, and flame. Neoprene rubber ages better and does not soften upon exposure to heat, although its high-temperature tensile strength may be lower than that of natural rubber. Neoprene can be used to make soft, relatively high-strength compounds. One important difference is that neoprene rubber does not have the low-temperature flexibility of natural rubber, which detracts from its use in low-temperature shock or impact applications. Properties of Neoprene and other common elastomers are shown in Table 1.

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings and, in particular, to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it can be seen that a motor assembly is designated generally by the numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Although a bypass motor assembly is shown, the present invention could be employed with any motor assembly or other device where a sealed bearing is required. In any event, the motor assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which rotates a shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The motor assembly includes a working air fan assembly <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which provides a shroud <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The shroud <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes an axial inlet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a plurality of radial outlets <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A fan <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is carried and rotated by the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> within the shroud <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for the purpose of drawing working air in through the inlet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The fan redirects the air radially in such a manner that it is directed through a diffuser <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which directs the air out through the outlets <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As discussed previously, the working air may contain moisture or other contaminants. Accordingly, there is a very strong desire to keep this moisture and contaminant-laden air from migrating along the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> To facilitate operation of the motor assembly, a sealed bearing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is captured between the diffuser <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Although the diffuser provides some moisture migration protection, the sealed bearing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is exposed to elements such as moisture, dust, and other contaminants. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, an end bracket <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be provided at an opposite end of the motor assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Another sealed bearing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be provided between the end bracket <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the motor shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> detailed description of the sealed bearing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will be provided. The bearing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes an outer ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that rotatably receives an inner ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The inner ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> provides a shaft opening therethrough which is press fit upon the shaft <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or other rotating member. Depending upon the particular embodiment, the inner ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may have some other internal structural configuration to facilitate rotation of the inner ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with respect to the outer ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Rolling elements <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are provided between the outer ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the inner ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and may be a ball, a cylinder, a tapered element, or whatever shape is appropriate for the particular end application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The inner ring has exposed surfaces <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from which extends an outer diameter edge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Extending annularly outwardly from the edge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is a pair of annular lips <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which face the same direction as the exposed surface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The annular lips <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> function to retain the rolling elements <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> within and between the rings <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The outer ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> provides exposed surfaces <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> with an inner diameter edge <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that face the outer diameter edge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Extending inwardly from the inner diameter edge <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is a pair of annular lips <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that each annular lip <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> faces in the same direction as the adjacent exposed surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and is aligned with the corresponding annular lip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The inner diameter edge <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes annular notches <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that are partially formed by the annular lip <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Opposed from each annular lip <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is a rim <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> such that the lip and rim are substantially parallel with one another. Depending upon the particular end application, it will be appreciated that structural features of each annular notch <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the rim <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may be provided as part of the inner ring <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> instead of the outer ring <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Positioning of the annular notch <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may also be dependent upon the particular end application in which the bearing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is to be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A semi-rigid seal frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is inserted into and carried by the annular notches <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. As shown, two seal frames <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are provided. Of course, if desired, only one seal on one side of the bearing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be provided. The frame, which may also be referred to as a carrier, includes a C-shaped member <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> with opposed, spaced apart, plates <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The opposed plates <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are connected at one end by an end plate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> so as to form a receptacle area <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. A seal ring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is received in the receptacle area <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The seal ring has an inner diameter <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and an outer diameter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The inner diameter <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> includes an edge <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, wherein the edge <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> has a thickness slightly larger than the gap between the plates <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, when the seal ring is received in the seal frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, an outer periphery portion of the seal ring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is slightly compressed. The portion that is not compressed is referred to as a flange and is designated generally by the numeral <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The inner diameter <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the exposed flange <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is preferably in uniform frictional contact with the outer edge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. In other words, the entire inner diameter <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> contacts the inner ring without gaps or openings therebetween. In the event the annular notch is provided by the inner ring, the outer diameter <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> would contact the inner diameter edge <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the ring which rotates, either the inner ring or the outer ring, is the member that is in frictional contact with the exposed portion of the seal ring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. It will also be appreciated that the seal frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> does not have to be C-shaped. The only structural requirement of the seal frame <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that it is able to carry the seal ring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> such that it positions the appropriate edge of the seal ring into frictional contact with the rotating member of the bearing assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Selection of the material used for seal ring <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has been found to be an important feature of the seal bearing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As noted in the background art, rubber materials and the like have been somewhat effective in providing a seal for the rolling elements contained within the bearing. But, it has been determined that improved performance can be obtained by a seal material that has improved properties such as evidenced by a material like expanded polytetrafluoroethylene provided by companies such as W. L. Gore and Associates. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is the oldest of the fluoroplastic family, and was first marketed under the Du Pont trade name &ldquo;Teflon.&rdquo; PTFE is characterized by its extreme inertness to chemicals, very high thermal stability, low coefficient of friction, and ability to resist adhesion to almost any material. Although PTFE is generally accepted as an important engineering material due to its properties, it has an inherent creeping property under load, especially at high temperatures. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) is made by stretching the PTFE as it is extruded. Shaped articles of ePTFE are useful when the following properties are required: chemical resistance, corrosion resistance, low frictional properties, non-stickiness, electrical insulating properties, heat resistance, compression creep resistance, compression resistance, impact strength, dimensional stability, gas barrier properties and tensile strength. The tensile strength for a sheet of ePTFE is on the order of 14,500 psi in the x and y directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In comparison to Neoprene, ePTFE has superior resistance to water and other chemicals, can operate over a wider range of temperatures, and has an extremely low coefficient of friction. Typical properties of ePTFE are shown in Table 2.

<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It is also known that expanded polytetrafluoroethylene is hydrophobic and does not degrade from excessive exposure to moisture and/or detergent-type materials. Moreover, the material can withstand frictional heat generated by contact with a rotating shaft and it has also been demonstrated to have superior wear properties. Accordingly, by providing a seal that can withstand the rigors of bearing operation, the seal precludes entry of contaminants into the rolling element area. As such, those rolling elements are protected and last longer. Accordingly, the bearings have a longer life and, since the bearings are one of the first elements to fail in a motor assembly, the motor assembly has a longer life. Another advantage of the present invention is that alternative ways for modifying the bearings and other systems for precluding moisture from entering the bearing area are avoided, thus reducing the overall cost of the construction and assembly of a motor assembly. Although the sealed bearing disclosed herein is used in the context of a bypass motor assembly, it will be appreciated that the sealed bearing could be used in any application where a bearing is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Thus, it can be seen that the objects of the invention have been satisfied by the structure and its method for use presented above. While in accordance with the Patent Statutes, only the best mode and preferred embodiment has been presented and described in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited thereto or thereby. Accordingly, for an appreciation of the true scope and breadth of the invention, reference should be made to the following claims. </paragraph>
