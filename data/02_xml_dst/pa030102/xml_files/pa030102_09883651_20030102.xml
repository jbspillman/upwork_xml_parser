<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to communications systems utilizing M-ary modulation formats and, more particularly, to an apparatus and method for efficiently communicating through a peak-power-limited, non-linear channel. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In high data rate communications systems, such as selected satellite communications systems, data transmission typically employs high power amplifiers such as traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs) or solid state power amplifiers (SSPAs). Such high speed communications systems typically require a relatively high output power so that the signal being transmitted can travel greater distances before being significantly attenuated. However, such power is limited by several considerations, including the limited energy generation and storage in the satellite vehicle. In these types of communications systems, low frequency digital baseband signals comprising the stream of digital data bits are transmitted after being modulated onto a high frequency carrier wave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Various modulation schemes exist and distinguish between the digital bits. Examples of digital modulation schemes include amplitude-shift keying (ASK), binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature-phase shift keying (QPSK), and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Further, the digital baseband signal may be multi level (M-ary) signals requiring multi level modulation methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Quadrature modulation schemes provide both amplitude and phase modulation of the carrier because both complex and imaginary representations of the signals are used. In quadrature amplitude modulation schemes, such as QAM, each bit is converted through a bit symbol representing a complex value having an in-phase, real component and a quadrature-phase, imaginary component. Each bit is represented on a graph having an imaginary axis and a real axis to form a constellation pattern representing a group of signals positioned within a circle around the origin of the axes. The distance from the origin represents the amount of power being transmitted. For example, four bits transmitted at a particular time may be represented as 16 symbols. Each symbol of the pattern identifies a complex voltage value having an in-phase component and a quadrature-phase component and represents the complex voltage value for a particular symbol, which is the time during which each symbol is transmitted. The symbols of the constellation pattern are geometrically spread so that they are more equally spaced apart to more readily distinguish the symbols and reduce bit errors. The constellation patterns are processed through the transmitter without being distorted so that the bits are readily distinguishable from each other at the receiver end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> High power amplifiers are desirable in high speed communications applications because they provide high gain over wide bandwidths. However, the input signal to a high power amplifier must be controlled because the high power amplifier exhibits non-linear transfer characteristics. At lower input powers, the output-input power relationship of the high power amplifier is approximately linear. At peak power output, the high power amplifier saturates, and further increases the input power beyond the saturation point actually decrease the output power of the amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Non-linear amplifiers are inherently more power efficient at creating radio frequency (RF) energy from direct current (DC) energy but create distortions in the process. Such distortions significantly complicate utilizing traditional signal constellations, such as M-ary QAM. Non-linear channels cause the constellation to rotate and expand non-uniformly. Various methods are available to compensate for this expansion and rotation, but such methods are complex and may be difficult to implement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The non-linearity of the high power amplifier affects the position of the true-invention is particular at predistortion symbols in the constellation pattern by moving them away from the origin. It is known to provide amplifier predistortion techniques in the amplifier when the transmitter is being operated in its non-linear range near peak output power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thus, it is desirable to provide an efficient communications system utilizing a peak-power-limited, non-linear channel which compensates for distortion. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a block diagram of communications system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for exchanging modulated data between a transmitter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via a communications link <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Communications link <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be an air link for satellite communications or hard-wired interconnection, such as an electrical connection or fiber optic connection. Transmitter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a modulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Modulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> receives a data stream at a baseband frequency and modulates the data stream utilizing a quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) format. In particular, modulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> modulates the data utilizing a M-ary QAM modulation format. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Typically modulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> modulates data bits of the data stream onto an analog carrier wave using mixer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. During modulation, modulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> identifies for each bit pattern a symbol that includes a in-phase and quadrature-phase component, and maps the symbols into a M-ary constellation pattern, as will be described in greater detail herein. Modulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be any quadrature amplitude modulator suitable for implementing the M-ary constellations as described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Modulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> outputs a radio frequency (RF) signal at a baseband frequency. Typically for satellite communications, the RF signal is up-converted to a high frequency for transmission. A mixer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> up-converts the baseband frequency with a high frequency signal, such as cos(&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>t). Mixer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> up-converts the in-phase and quadrature-phase representation of the complex voltage from modulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to a single high frequency RF signal. The up-converted RF signal is then applied to amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to significantly increase the signal gain for transmission. Operation of the mixing step and amplification step for a transmitter of this type is well understood by those skilled in the art. The up-converted, amplified signal from amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is applied to RF filter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for subsequent RF filtering, such as may be required by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requirements. The filtered signal is output to an antenna <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for transmission to receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> introduces a distortion into the signal output by modulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The output for amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which is applied to RF filter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has an inherent distortion. As will be described in greater detail herein with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, modulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> operates so as to introduce a predistortion into the signal output by modulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and applied to mixer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> thus adjusts the predistorted signal to output a distortion compensated signal input to RF filter <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Antenna <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> receives the filtered signal and outputs over communications link <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> a communications signal which is received by antenna <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of transmitter <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Antenna <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is connected to an amplifier <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which is preferably a low-noise, linear amplifier. Note that although communication system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown as having a wireless communications link <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, communications link <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be a hard-wired connection, as described above. In such a situation, antennas <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The signal received by antenna <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> at receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is input to a filter <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Filter <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> provides initial filtering of the received signal to filter channel noise and the like. Typically, filter <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is closely matched to the transmitted signal frequency. The output of filter <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is applied to a mixer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to down-convert the RF signal to an intermediate frequency signal by mixing the RF signal with a high frequency cos(&ohgr;<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>t) signal. The down-converted signal from mixer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> includes baseband in-phase and quadrature-phase components. The down-converted signal is applied to low-pass filter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to provide filtering at baseband frequencies. Thus, in receiver <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, filter <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> acts as a course filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The filtered baseband signal from low-pass filter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is applied to a demodulator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Demodulator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> demodulates the received signal in accordance with the M-ary QAM format implemented in modulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Demodulator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> thus outputs the data initially modulated by modulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In a particular feature of the subject invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts a 24-ary QAM constellation arranged on a Cartesian coordinate system defined by an in-phase axis <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and quadrature-phase axis <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The 24-ary constellation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> includes an upper amplitude level <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a lower amplitude level <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Upper amplitude level <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and lower amplitude level <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> represent differing power levels for driving amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Upper amplitude level <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> represents the peak power of amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and lower amplitude level <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> represents a power level less than the peak power of amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A plurality of upper amplitude symbols <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are arranged on upper amplitude level <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a plurality of lower amplitude symbols <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are arranged on lower amplitude level <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the 24-ary constellation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, </cross-reference>16 upper amplitude symbols <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are arranged along upper amplitude level <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and 8 lower amplitude symbols <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are arranged along lower amplitude level <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Amplitude levels <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the 24-ary constellation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> define two concentric circles with the upper amplitude level <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> having an amplitude greater than lower amplitude level <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Upper amplitude level <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has a unit radius of 1, and inner amplitude level <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has a radius of 0.54. Upper amplitude symbols <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are separated along the upper amplitude level <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by 22.5&deg; with one upper amplitude symbols <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> located at cartesion coordinates x&equals;1 and y&equals;0, (1,0). Similarly, lower amplitude symbols <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are arranged along lower amplitude level <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and are separated by 45&deg;, with one lower amplitude symbol <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> located at Cartesian coordinate x&equals;0.54 and y&equals;0, (0.54, 0). The 24-ary constellation enables modulation of an average 4.58 bit word or symbol. To implement a practical 24-ary system requires mapping of a large number of binary bits(M) to a number (M/4.58) of 24-ary symbols. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The arrangement of symbols of upper amplitude level <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and lower amplitude <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is particularly selected to maximize the number of points in which amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can operate at saturation. In particular, by placing the maximum number of points on upper amplitude level <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> operates in saturation mode for transmission of the maximum number of symbols. The symbols placed on lower amplitude level <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> represent operation of amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a backed-off mode. However, due to signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) considerations, not all points can be placed on upper amplitude level <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Arranging and placing symbols on each of upper amplitude level <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and lower amplitude level <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> preferrably maximizes the number of symbols for which amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> operates in saturation mode while pursuing good performance in the presence of noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts a constellation similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, but shows a 32-ary constellation for use by modulator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The 32-ary constellation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> enables modulation of up to a 5 bit word or symbol. The 32-ary constellation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> includes three amplitude levels: a first amplitude level <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a second amplitude level <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and a third amplitude level <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. First amplitude level <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has an amplitude greater than second amplitude level <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and second amplitude level <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has a greater amplitude than third amplitude level <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Each amplitude level <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> defines three concentric circles. First amplitude level <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes first amplitude symbols <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, second amplitude level <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> includes second amplitude symbols <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and third amplitude level <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> includes third amplitude symbols <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. First amplitude level <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a unit radius of 1, second amplitude level <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has a radius of 0.662, and third amplitude level <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has a radius of 0.25. First amplitude level <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes 16 first amplitude level symbols <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, second amplitude level <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> includes 12 second amplitude symbols <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and third amplitude level <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> includes four third amplitude symbols <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
