<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a chest catheter water barrier and more particularly, to a substantially waterproof chest catheter water barrier which is selectively wearable by a user and which is effective to reduce the likelihood of infection or discomfort to the user of a chest catheter. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A central line catheter or chest catheter generally comprises a substantially plastic tube which is inserted into a large vein of an individual&apos;s chest. These chest catheters are used to transfer various intravenous fluids (e.g., chemotherapy solutions) to an individual and to allow blood to be obtained from the individual. In order to facilitate this transfer of intravenous fluid, one open end portion of the chest catheter must project out of the user&apos;s chest. Due to the fact that chest catheters involve maintaining an exit site out of the chest, a user must be particularly careful to keep the projecting catheter and the catheter exit site clean and dry to avoid infection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Because the exit site and catheter need to be kept dry, showering presents difficulties to a person with a chest catheter. Current methods and devices which permit a person with a chest catheter to shower involve applying a sheet of waterproof material to the person&apos;s chest over the catheter and using an adhesive to attach the material to the person&apos;s skin (i.e., applying tape around edges of the sheet). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> While these current methods and devices are intended to prevent water from reaching the catheter and/or catheter exit site, they do have several drawbacks. One drawback is that the tape or adhesive oftentimes loses its adhesive ability when water is applied to it and subsequently, water will enter or intrude upon the area sought to be protected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another drawback to applying a waterproof sheet using an adhesive is that individuals who require chest catheters are often in a relatively fragile physical condition. This is particularly so with individuals who are receiving chemotherapy (oftentimes through the chest catheter). The chemicals used in chemotherapy often result in side effects such as, but not limited to, extreme sensitivity and fragility of the skin. By using an adhesive to hold the sheet to the body which must later be pulled off or &ldquo;torn away&rdquo; from the wearer&apos;s skin/chest, current methods and devices cause great discomfort and/or pain to the individual it is applied to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there is a need for a new and improved substantially waterproof catheter water barrier which overcomes at least some of the previously delineated drawbacks of prior methods and devices, which provides an effective and safe means to keep a chest catheter and its exit site dry, and which may be removed from a user with no resulting physical discomfort or pain. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is a first advantage of the present invention to provide a catheter water barrier which overcomes at least some of the previously delineated drawbacks of prior catheter waterproofing devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is a second advantage of the present invention to provide a catheter water barrier which overcomes at least some of the previously delineated drawbacks of prior catheter waterproofing devices and which, by way of example and without limitation, provides a waterproof barrier which may be tied or strapped on to a wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is a third advantage of the present invention to provide a catheter water barrier which overcomes at least some of the previously delineated drawbacks of prior catheter waterproofing devices and which substantially prevent water from being introduced to the protected region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to a first aspect of the present invention, a catheter water barrier is provided. The catheter water barrier comprises a section of waterproof material having two channels along opposing edges and a relatively long tie down strip which is disposed through the two channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> According to a second aspect of the present invention, a catheter water barrier is provided. The catheter water barrier comprises a generally rectangular waterproof polymer barrier portion having two channels and a relatively long nylon tie strip which is disposed through the two channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> According to a third aspect of the present invention a method for using a catheter water barrier on a user having a chest catheter is provided. The method comprises the steps of providing a catheter water barrier having a barrier portion, at least two channels, and a relatively long tie down strip; forming a loop by inserting the tie down strip through the at least two channels; placing the head of the user through the loop; disposing the barrier portion over the chest catheter; and tying the ends of the tie down strip together, thereby causing the tie down strip to hold the barrier portion to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment of the invention and by reference to the following drawings.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, there is a catheter water barrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is made in accordance with the teachings of the preferred embodiment of the invention. Particularly, the catheter water barrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a barrier portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a tie down strip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Barrier portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and strip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> cooperatively act to form a watertight barrier against the intrusion of water <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> or any other outside possible contaminant (e.g., soap or shampoo) into the region around the chest catheter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of an individual user <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Barrier portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is comprised of a generally rectangular section of relatively thin, substantially waterproof, and non-toxic material such as, but not limited to, a polymer material. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, barrier portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> further comprises a pair of channels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which are formed along opposing edges <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Channels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be created by folding over and sealing edges <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (e.g., by using a conventional adhesive) or alternatively, may be integrally formed within the barrier portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Tie down strip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a relatively long thin piece of material which, in one non-limiting embodiment, is constructed of a nylon material. Tie down strip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is of sufficient length to allow strip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be placed through channel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, around the neck of a user <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and through channel <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, while allowing barrier portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to remain over the catheter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and while leaving sufficient length to allow the opposing ends <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to be tied together behind a user&apos;s back (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) or to be wrapped around the back of the user <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and tied in front of the <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> user <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> (not shown). Tie down strip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> further comprises a pair of caps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are disposed upon the respective ends <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to prevent the tie down strip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from being separated from or &ldquo;pulled out&rdquo; of channels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of barrier portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In one non-limiting embodiment, caps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are physically coupled to ends <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are integrally formed with the down strip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> When catheter water barrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fastened securely to a user <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The tie down strip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> acts to physically hold barrier portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> against the skin of user <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and thereby creates a watertight seal to prevent water <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> from reaching catheter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In one non-limiting embodiment of the invention, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, catheter water barrier <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is comprised of substantially all the elements of catheter water barrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, but further includes a set of flaps <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which forms a pouch portion <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> which may be used to substantially envelop catheter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to provide additional protection against the intrusion of water <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Flaps <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be attached to barrier portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using a conventional adhesive or alternatively, may be integrally formed with barrier portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The longitudinal axes of flaps <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are positioned substantially perpendicular to channels <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. It should be noted, however, that while the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts the longitudinal axes of flaps <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> substantially perpendicular to channels <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, alternate embodiments (not shown) may include having flaps <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> running substantially parallel to channels <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In another non-limiting embodiment of the invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, catheter water barrier <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is substantially similar to catheter water barrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, but instead of having channels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> run along opposing edges <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, catheter water barrier comprises a pair of channels <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which form an &ldquo;X&rdquo;-shaped pattern across the barrier portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In this alternate embodiment, channels <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> intersect at the approximate center of generally rectangular barrier portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, by placing the intersection point <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> of channels <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> above the position of catheter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, this embodiment provides additional protection against intrusion by water <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> when tie down strip <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is tied tightly and thereby causes strip <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to push barrier portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> securely against the skin of user <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the exact construction or method which has been previously delineated, but that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and the scope of the inventions as are set forth in the following claims. Examples of such modifications include, but are not limited to: providing additional tie down strips <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>; applying a barrier cream (e.g., petroleum jelly) substantially around the catheter <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to cooperate with the barrier portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; or increasing the rigidity of the edges orthogonal to edges <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. It should be appreciated that barrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be selectively used to cover substantially any part of the body and that nothing in this Application is meant to limit the use of the barrier <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to only the chest area. </paragraph>
