<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to information handling, and more particularly to methods and systems to improve handling of personally identifiable information. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Many approaches to information handling have been proposed in the past. Regarding approaches to storing data in a way that is useful for some process, examples include U.S. Pat. No. 5,109,337 (Ferriter, et al., Apr. 28, 1992), which relates to a manufacturing effort or hardware design. It discloses a &ldquo;conceptual design tool method&rdquo; that involves storing manufacturing information in a database, and generating a parts list. Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 6,223,094 B1 (Muehleck et al., Apr. 24, 2001), which relates to manufacturing (of vehicles, for example) and discloses a data structure, with multiple layers, for products, components, and manufacturing processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Regarding approaches to storing data in a way that allows control over access and use of the data (e.g. access is allowed or not allowed, according to a rule), examples include U.S. Pat. No. 6,112,181 (Shear et al., Aug. 29, 2000), which relates to the transmission (&ldquo;narrowcasting&rdquo;) of selected digital information, associated with &ldquo;rights management information&rdquo; or rules and controls. The &ldquo;rights management information&rdquo; mainly concerns commercial use: e.g. payment, membership cards, creation of an audit record, creation of a derivative work. Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 6,138,119 (Hall et al., Oct. 24, 2000), which discloses a descriptive data structure, and data packaged with rules in a secure container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, the above-mentioned examples address substantially different problems, and thus are significantly different from the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In light of laws and public concern regarding privacy, there is a need for systems and methods to improve the handling of personally identifiable information. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Regarding the present invention, one set of features involves handling personally identifiable information, by (1) providing in a computer a first set of object classes representing active entities in an information-handling process, wherein a limited number of privacy-related actions represent operations performed on data; (2) providing in the computer a second set of object classes representing data and rules in the information-handling process, wherein at least one object class has rules associated with data; and (3) handling transactions involving personally identifiable information, using the computer and object classes. A second set of features involves using the above-mentioned objects in constructing a model of an information-handling process, and providing output that identifies ways in which personally identifiable information could be better handled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One advantage of the invention is that it provides a way to enforce privacy policy at the process level either manually or via automation. For example, a model could be constructed on paper first. Then the instantiated object model could be used as the basis for a design that could be implemented via computer. As another example, an information-handling process could be improved by using the model. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention uses terminology from International Business Machine Corporation&apos;s Enterprise Privacy Architecture (EPA). This architecture describes a model and a terminology for describing and handling personally identifiable information (PII). The present invention may apply to any process of handling PII by any person or organization, including those engaged in commerce, medicine, science, education, government, law enforcement, insurance, and finance. The concepts of an empty form for gathering data under a specified policy, and a filled form for representing the gathered data along with the policy, are used when describing data actions. The concept of the empty form may be implemented by various techniques for gathering data and specifying policy, such as printed policy statements and email or phone contact. The concept of the filled form may be implemented in any way of capturing input data and storing it, associated with the policy. The main actors in EPA are a data subject (i.e. the person who is described by the PII) and one or more data users (e.g. different organizations or individuals). EPA uses a limited set of privacy-related actions : access, disclose, release, notify, utilize, update, withdrawConsent, giveConsent, delete, anonymize, depersonalize, and repersonalize.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The examples that follow involve the use of computers and a network. The present invention is not limited as to the type of computer on which it runs, and not limited as to the type of network used. Various implementation methods may be used for the present invention. The examples that follow involve information that is communicated between computers; this information could be in hypertext markup language (HTML), or extensible markup language (XML), or some other language or protocol could be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> XML provides a way of containing and managing information that is designed to handle data exchange among various data systems. Thus it is well-suited to implementation of the present invention. Reference is made to the book by Elliotte Rusty Harold and W. Scott Means, <highlight><italic>XML in a Nutshell </italic></highlight>(O&apos;Reilly &amp; Associates, 2001). As a general rule XML messages use &ldquo;attributes&rdquo; to contain information about data, and &ldquo;elements&rdquo; to contain the actual data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The following are definitions of terms used in the description of the present invention and in the claims: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Attribute: The term that is used to describe the passive aspects of classes/objects in Object Oriented Design/Programming. It may be seen as the equivalent of a data field in a database record (which is called attribute since the introduction of relational databases). An attribute can take values of a certain type (like integer number, string etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Class: In Object Oriented Design/Programming, the term class is used to describe the type of an object. It is defined by its properties (mainly the attributes and methods) and the action of actually creating an object in concrete cases is called instantiation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;Computer-usable medium&rdquo; means any carrier wave, signal or transmission facility for communication with computers, and any kind of computer memory, such as floppy disks, hard disks, Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), CD-ROM, flash ROM, non-volatile ROM, and non-volatile memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Data Subject: The party (individual or under some legislation also legal entity) whose data is being collected and processed and whose privacy we are dealing with </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Data User: The party who is processing data (processing in the sense as defined by the European Data Protection Directive covering all steps from collection to deletion.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> EPA: Enterprise Privacy Architecture. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is defined as &ldquo;Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (&lsquo;data subject&rsquo;).&rdquo; An identifiable person is one who can be &ldquo;identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social category.&rdquo; (From the EU Data Directive.) &ldquo;Storing&rdquo; data or information, using a computer, means placing the data or information, for any length of time, in any kind of computer memory, such as floppy disks, hard disks, Random Access Memory (RAM), Read Only Memory (ROM), CD-ROM, flash ROM, non-volatile ROM, and non-volatile memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a simplified example of an information handling system that may be used to practice the present invention. The invention may be implemented on a variety of hardware platforms, including personal computers, workstations, servers, and embedded systems.

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating an example of a method for improving the handling of Personally Identifiable Information, according to the teachings of the present invention. On one hand is an information-handling process, at block <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, (a business process for example) which is modeled by an object model at block <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. On the other hand exist laws or contracts, at block <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, from which a rules set at block <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is derived. At block <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, object model <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and rules set <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> are compared; actions taken at block <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> are checking for compliance, and identifying ways to improve the information-handling process.

There may be feedback to the object model at block <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> for adaptation purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating an example of a method for handling Personally Identifiable Information, along with key terms and concepts, according to the teachings of the present invention. The concepts of an empty form, <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, for gathering data under a specified policy, and a filled form <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> for representing the gathered data along with the policy, are used when describing data actions. The concept of the empty form, <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, may be implemented by various techniques for gathering data and specifying policy, such as printed policy statements and email or phone contact. The concept of the filled form <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> may be implemented in any way of capturing input data and storing it, associated with the policy. The main actors in EPA are a data subject <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> (i.e. the person who is described by the PII ) and one or more data users, <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (e.g. different organizations or individuals). Initially, a data user <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> asks a data subject <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> to release data, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. This done by first sending an empty form <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> that contains fields to fill in, as well as a privacy policy. Then the data subject <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> returns a filled form <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> that contains his or her PII along with the associated policy. PII always is associated with policy. Later, a data user <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> may want to send the data to another data user <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. This is called disclosure, <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>. A data user <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> sends an empty form <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> including a policy. The data user <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> checks to see whether a disclosure to this data user <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> under the given policy is allowed. If so, the data is filled into the empty form <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and the resulting filled form <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is sent to the other data user <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. A privacy policy contains a set of rules that are specific to a data user such as <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. Each rule allows a privacy action on personal data within specified constraints. EPA defines twelve privacy actions. The privacy actions described by the policy rules define the purpose for which data can be utilized and disclosed. Constraints may require consent from the data subject <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> before the action is allowed, or rules may allow consent to be withdrawn. This supports opt-in or opt-out choices for the data subject <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating an example of a method for improving the handling of Personally Identifiable Information, along with key terms and concepts, according to the teachings of the present invention. The present invention provides an object called an Empty Form, shown at <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, that describes what is allowed to happen to data. The present invention provides an equivalent entity called a privacy agreement, shown at <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, to capture real life privacy relationships. Privacy agreements <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> are derived from natural language privacy policy set <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, which may include regulations, business policies, and customer preferences, for example. Rules set <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> also is derived from natural language privacy policy set <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>, through translation to object modeling representation. Empty Forms <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> are derived from rules set <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. A privacy agreement <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is a subset of the natural language privacy policy set <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> that constitute an organization&apos;s privacy policy; the subset is specific to a particular situation or purpose, just as an Empty Form, shown at <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, is a subset of the rules set <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> specific to a particular situation or purpose. The difference is that the privacy agreement <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> is specific to the two parties involved, whereas the Empty Form, shown at <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, is specific to the data. Rules set <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, Empty Forms <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>, and privacy agreements <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> are useful for analyzing and improving the handling of Personally Identifiable Information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating an example of a method for handling Personally Identifiable Information, along with key terms and concepts, according to the teachings of the present invention. The twelve privacy-relevant actions, according to the teachings of the present invention, describe the actions that can be taken on the different categories of data, and three of them actually provide a mechanism for transforming data between three main categories as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is defined as &ldquo;Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (&lsquo;data subject&rsquo;).&rdquo; An identifiable person is one who can be &ldquo;identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social category.&rdquo; (From the EU Data Directive.) PII <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> is any data, or combination of data, that can be used to identify a person. In an online bookstore, for example, any record that contains the subscriber&apos;s full name or exact address is PII <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> De-Personalized Data <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is PII where the link to the data subject is not visible, and cannot be established without knowing some additional information <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> (like the correspondence between a pseudonym and the real name and address of the data subject). Data can be already collected in depersonalized form (e.g., under a pseudonym), or generated from PII <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> by detaching all identifying elements <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, on a temporary basis. This can facilitate analysis, reporting and other uses of information that do not require the ability to specifically identify the data subject. Knowing the additional linking information <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, depersonalized data <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> can be reconstituted into a PII <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In an online bookstore, for example, an order number together with the list of books in that order would be depersonalized data <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, while this data together with the information on which subscriber created that order would be PII <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Removing all identifying elements, by process anonymize <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, transforms PII <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> and depersonalized data <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> into anonymized data <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight>. This type of information is often aggregated for reporting purposes. Since it can still provide a transaction level view, an enterprise is able to plan and understand their customer set and operations effectively while ensuring a high level of protection for the data subject. In an online bookstore, for example, this would be data that can be held by the marketing department to identify the top book sold in a particular city. The Marketing Department would not need the actual name of the subscribers who bought that book, just that &ldquo;subscribers&rdquo; bought that book in, say, Chicago. The PII <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> would have to be cleansed of all identifiers by another department (e.g. Billing Department) before the Marketing Department would gain access to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In addition to this categorization of data, the EPA Data Model provides the following sub-categories for various types of contextual data that constitute PII <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> when connected with a name (this is consistent with the framework introduced by P3P, Platform for Privacy Preferences, an industry consortium working on automated communication of privacy preferences). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> These sub-categories have been defined in detail and provide a basis for data de-personalization and provide additional useful terminology that can be used in designing specific EPA objects (e.g., privacy agreements) in a standardized and reusable way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a class diagram illustrating objects to be used in a process for improving the handling of Personally Identifiable Information, according to the teachings of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> uses Unified Modeling Language (UML), the de facto standard in Business Object Modeling. In particular, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows classes representing active entities like human beings or legal entities. Inheritance relationships are shown by lines that have a triangle on the end by the parent or superclass. Regarding <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the term &ldquo;method&rdquo; has a special meaning. The term &ldquo;method&rdquo; is used for active aspects or behaviors of classes or objects in Object-Oriented Design or Programming. Usually a method is looked at as a service that is being provided by the object in question and requested by another object sending a message to the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The twelve privacy-relevant actions by active entities are shown as services being provided by the objects in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Notify( ): This method is present at the Party <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> level, that is, all subclasses of Party <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> are capable of performing the corresponding action. The method executes in the object receiving notification (and could therefore be called &ldquo;receive_notification&rdquo;). In the model, the method is triggered (or its execution is requested) by the DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> whereas the method itself executes in the object receiving notification (DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> or PrivacyAuthority <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>). Consider the following examples; execution by DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>: Many laws obligate physicians to report cases of infectious diseases (e.g. tuberculosis) to health authorities. Now, for reasons of transparency and in the interest of a good relationship between patient and physician, the doctor will let his patient know what data is being transmitted to whom and for what purposes (he will notify the patient about this fact). The notify( ) method will be executed by the patient. Consider execution by Guardian <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>: According to COPPA (Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act) the DataUser who is running a website targeting children must make notify the parents about the fact that he is collecting information from their child and about the purposes of processing. The notify( ) method is executed by the Guardian <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> and triggered by DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. Consider execution by PrivacyAuthority <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>: The Swiss Data Protection Law (article 6 &sect;2) asks the DataUser to notify the Data Protection Commissioner about certain cases of transborder communication of personal information. The notify( ) method is executed by the PrivacyAuthority <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. Consider execution by DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>: When a DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> finds out that some personal information he processes is erroneous, he may find it appropriate to notify( ) the source from where he collected this information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> GiveConsent( ): This method is present in the classes DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, Guardian <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> and PrivacyAuthority <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>. In the model, its execution is requested by a DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. Executing this method means expressing consent for a specified use of a certain set of personal information. Consider the following examples execution by DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>: The customer (DataSubject) of a shop (DataUser) agrees that his address may be used for marketing purposes by this data user. Consider execution by Guardian <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>: According to COPPA (Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act) the DataUser who is running a website targeting children must make an effort to obtain parental consent for the collection, use and disclosure of child&apos;s personal information. If this effort is successful, the Guardian <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> can giveConsent( ) for the proposed purpose. Consider execution by PrivacyAuthority <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>: In some countries PrivacyAuthority <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> has the power to authorize the processing of personal information. One might argue that this is not exactly an act of giving consent, but basically what the PrivacyAuthority <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> does in this case, is to substitute the consent of the DataSubject which is why the giveConsent( ) is present in the PrivacyAuthority <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> class. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Release( ): This method is specific to the DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> in the sense that only objects of this class contain it. The execution of the method may be triggered by the DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>&apos;s own will or by a request from a DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. The execution of the method is the DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>&apos;s action of releasing his personal information to a Data User. Consider the following example: When applying for car insurance DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> fills out a form and sends it to the insurance company (DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>) and thereby releases personal information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Disclose( ): This method is only present in objects of class DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. It is triggered by the request coming from another DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> and its execution is the action of communicating data to that other DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. Note that the method can stand for a communication across enterprise boundaries as well as for communications internal to an enterprise. Consider the following examples: A physician reports cases of tuberculosis to the public health authorities thereby disclosing patients&apos; information. An HR employee is being asked by a clerk of the accounting department to communicate to him all information he has on a certain other employee. This example shows a) that it makes sense to have rules concerning disclosures internal to an enterprise and b) that it makes sense to have an enterprise modeled as more than one single DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Update( ): This method is present in the DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> class and corresponds to the action of modifying data. Consider the following example: The owner of a shop (DataUser) updates a customer&apos;s (DataSubject) address. Note that this update can take place upon request by the DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> or by the DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> autonomously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> WithdrawConsent( ): When the DataSubject withdraws his consent, e.g. with respect to a certain purpose of processing (cf. example below), then this method is executed by the DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> (upon request from the DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>). The method may, however, also be triggered by another DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> who has the obligation to propagate the consent withdrawal. The counter-intuitive name of this method deserves a comment: In the real world, it is obvious that the withdrawal of consent is an action that the DataSubject is executing. It does, however, not make a great deal of sense to introduce this method into the model (because it is never triggered by another method, but always by the individual&apos;s own free will). On the other hand, the naming follows a pattern frequently encountered in system design: If an object performs a method, which again triggers a method of another object, then they frequently are given the same name. This does not lead to misunderstandings, because the full names of methods are always composed like this: &lt;objectname&gt;.&lt;methodname&gt;. Consider the following example: When a DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> asks a DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> to stop sending her marketing material (DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> opts out), the latter modifies his rules with respect to the DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> in question. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Access( ): This method is the DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>&apos;s action of granting the DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> access to her information. The method will always be invoked by the DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> (or Guardian <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>). Consider the following example: After a customer (DataSubject) has asked and proved her identity, the online bookstore (DataUser) grants the customer access to her information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Utilize( ): This unary method is present in the DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> class and corresponds to the action of using a certain piece of information the DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> is holding. The qualifier &ldquo;unary&rdquo; means that this action&mdash;as opposed to the previously mentioned ones&mdash;does not imply the participation of two parties, because it is executed by the same Party that has triggered the execution. Note that on their own, the words utilize or use do not have a precise meaning in this context. In the real world the central and most meaningful element of a utilize action is its purpose (cf. the example given below). In the real world, the execution of this method is requested implicitly by the DataUser himself (and there may be cases where it is requested explicitly by legislative texts). Consider the following example: It may be acceptable that an enterprise installs video cameras at particular places in order to guarantee their employees&apos; safety; the material gathered with this equipment may therefore be used with this purpose in mind, but not for other purposes (like surveillance of employees&apos; behavior). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Anonymize( ): The method is only contained in objects of class DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>. It is the first special case of the utilize action which is modeled separately because of its special relevance in the privacy context. Its execution is the action of taking a set of personal information and stripping off all the elements that would possibly allow the information to be related to specific DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>&apos;s. Consider the following example, of records containing the fields name, address, as well as age in years, and blood pressure; if the name and address fields are stripped off, the set of age and blood pressure may be called non personally identifiable information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Depersonalize( ): This method is also specific to the DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> class and the second special case of the utilize action which is modeled separately because of its special relevance in the privacy context. It consists of taking a set of personal information and stripping off enough in order to prevent the linkage to individual DataSubject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>&apos;s. As opposed to the anonymize action, this action is reversible. That is, there is a means to re-personalize the information. Consider the following example: In a cancer register database, identifying information is replaced by a number or code. At the same time, a table of correspondence between the codes and the identifying information is set up and stored in a secured place. This table can later be used in order to re-personalize the information (which is necessary if one wants to update the register with new information). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Repersonalize( ): This is another method that only the DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> can perform. It is the third special case of the utilize action which is modeled separately because of its special relevance in the privacy context. The content of the method is the action of re-introducing identifying information to a set of depersonalized information. Consider the example given above for depersonalize( ). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> GetPrivacyInformation( ): This method is a privacy relevant action specific to the Canadian regulatory context and might not be needed under other legislation. This legislation asks the DataUser to make available his data handling policies and practices including the identity of the responsible person for privacy in the enterprise. The method is specific to DataUser <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> class objects and is usually requested by the Data Subject <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a class diagram illustrating objects to be used in a process for improving the handling of Personally Identifiable Information, according to the teachings of the present invention. In particular, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows classes representing data and rules. Inheritance relationships are shown by lines that have a triangle on the end by the parent component, or superclass. Containment, or aggregate, relationships are shown with lines that have a diamond on the end by the containing component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Regarding <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the term &ldquo;method&rdquo; has a special meaning, as it does regarding <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The term &ldquo;method&rdquo; is used for active aspects or behaviors of classes or objects. Usually a method is looked at as a service that is being provided by the object in question and requested by another object sending a message to the object. As an analogy to the paper based world, an EmptyForm <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> is a document consisting of two parts: The first part consists of empty spaces (FormFields) prepared to be filled with data. These spaces have labels and descriptions that define the kind of data (DataItemTypeDescription)that can be filled into them (e.g. a field labeled &ldquo;name&rdquo; is prepared to be filled with a string of characters that will represent the name of a DataSubject <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>). The second part consists of rules describing what can or cannot be done with the future contents of the data fields. More precisely, these rules can describe the purpose for which the information may be used as well as the data users, <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>,&mdash;or data user types (e.g. insurance companies) that have the right to use the information. </paragraph>

This example, Scenario &num;1, and following examples involve an adult named Jan, his nine-year old daughter Mina, and a communications company named Xcom having Internet Service Provider (ISP) and mobile phone divisions. The mobile phone division contains marketing (MD), subscription (SD), and billing (BD) departments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Overview/Outcome: Jan, <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>, subscribes to a mobile phone contract with Xcom and therefore has to release information about himself. In order to provide the service, Xcom discloses Jan&apos;s information to the Xcom billing department, <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Privacy Related Actions: Release, and disclose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Message Flow Description: 1. Jan, <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>, requests, at <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>, a mobile phone subscription from Xcom&apos;s SD, <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> 2. SD <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> looks up the corresponding Empty Form, at <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, for the requested service and sends it to Jan, <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>. The Empty Form actually contains a description of the requested data and the rules that constrain what the user is allowed to do with the data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> 3 &amp; 4. Jan <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> releases, <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight>, information about himself by filling out, <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>, the Empty Form and returning the Filled Form. By filling out and returning the form, Jan <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> implicitly consents to the use of his data subject to the rules contained in the form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> 5. To actually provide the mobile phone service, the SD <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> asks the BD <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> to bill Jan <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> for his mobile phone conversations&mdash;thus the SD <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> requests from the BD <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> the &lsquo;mobile billing service,&rsquo; <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> 6. In order to provide the service the BD <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> needs to get hold of the customer&apos;s (here: Jan&apos;s) data. Therefore the BD <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> looks up the corresponding empty form, <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>, for the billing service and sends it to the SD <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> 7. The SD <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> is about to disclose, <highlight><bold>1007</bold></highlight>, information about Jan <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> that was collected in step 3. In order to disclose the information steps 8. and 9.have to be performed: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> 8. The information requested by the BD <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> may only be provided if its purpose of use is in accordance with the rules under which Jan <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> has released his data in step 3. This condition is verified by querying the FilledForm <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> (from step 3), whereas the BD&apos;s EmptyForm and the party to whom the data (here: BD <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight>) is disclosed have to be included in the request, <highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> 9. The disclosure was authorized, thus the SD <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> fills out, <highlight><bold>1009</bold></highlight>, the EmptyForm and returns the FilledForm to the BD. </paragraph>
