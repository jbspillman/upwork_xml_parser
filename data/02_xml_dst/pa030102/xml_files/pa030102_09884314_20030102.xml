<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a blade, and a holder for that blade, for use in a manual or automated surgical device used for cutting the cornea of the eye and particularly for forming a corneal flap. Several surgical devices are currently available for cutting corneal tissue or a circular flap in the cornea around the pupil of the eye. These devices, commonly referred to as microkeratomes, are placed on the cornea and held in place by suction applied to the periphery of the cornea. A disposable blade is placed into the device and the sharpened edge of the blade is advanced at a precise angle and a predetermined depth into the corneal tissue. The device then provides for a vibrating or oscillating motion to the blade and allows the blade to be moved in a circular, linear, or curvilinear path around the central axis of the microkeratome. This results in the cornea being cut to raise a thin circular layer of anterior cornea with the incision being from about 100 to 200 micron, in depth and about 10 mm in diameter. In a more recent procedure, referred to as LASIK surgery, the circular corneal incision is combined with laser sculpting of a portion of the cornea. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Several microkeratomes are shown in the patent literature. U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,456 covers a device offered by Bausch &amp; Lomb, known as the Hansatome, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,051,009 is directed to blades specifically designed for use in the device shown in the &prime;<highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight> patent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Other patents to microkeratomes of different designs are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,496,339 and 5,658,303 to Koepnick, U.S. Pat. No. 4,884,570 to Krumeich, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,501,174 and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>591</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> to Clark et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,342,378 to Giraud et al, U.S. Pat. No. 6,022,365 to Aufaure et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,133,726 to Ruiz et al, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,662,370 to Hoffmann et al. All operate in generally the same manner and all require a disposable blade be inserted therein. However, each device requires a different shaped blade and/or blade with blade holder. Therefore, there is a value in having a disposable blade configuration, which may have varied dimensions, which can be assembled with a suitable blade holder for each different device, using the same assembly techniques, so as to provide ease of manufacturing and uniformity of surgical outcome irrespective of the instrument into which the blade or blade assembly is placed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a top view of a blade incorporating features of the invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in a preferred embodiment fabricated of a flat surgical steel about 0.01 inches thick, is in the shape of a triangle with a forward portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> beveled to a sharp edge <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The various triangular embodiments have a forward portion from about 0.45 to about 0.53 inches in width. The triangular blade has a dimension from the forward portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the point <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from about 0.27 to about 0.32 inches. The two side edges <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the blade meet at a point <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> spaced from the front edge <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Extending from each of the side edges <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are extensions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, generally in the plane of the blade. In the embodiment shown in the figures, the extensions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are circular in shape, the circular extensions intersecting the first and second side edges <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the blade. In a preferred construction, the circular extension <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> have at least about 180&deg; of the circumference extending from the blade. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 9</cross-reference> have about 270&deg; of the circumference in the extension while the remaining 90&deg; constitutes the intersection of the extensions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with the blade side edges <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In order to adapt the various blades <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to operate with the various different microkeratomes the blade is generally attached to a holder to form a blade assembly, the holder being designed to receive a drive mechanism. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> show a side, top and bottom view of a first embodiment of the blade of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> attached to a blade holder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to form a blade assembly <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The blade holder is typically formed of a machined or molded plastic material. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and the variation of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the bottom surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the blade holder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has an indented blade receiving portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> with raised areas <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> on either side of the indented area sized and shaped to receive the extensions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as well as a portion of the blade itself. A circular extension <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extending more than 180&deg; in arc is preferred as this provides a self centering function when the blade is attached to the blade <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> holder by various assembly techniques. The blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is retained in the indented blade receiving portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the blade holder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by an adhesive, cold staking, heat staking, over moldings, or snap (detent) fit means. Snap (dent) fittings utilizes a receiving portion with an angled edges <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. Alternatively, a preformed blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be molded into the plastic blade holder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> when it is formed. Also, the bottom surface of the blade holder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is at an angle to the plane of the top surface, typically 10&deg; to 45&deg;, so that the blade rests at a desired angle to horizontal when placed in the microkeratome. Alternatively, a separate bottom (not shown) can be applied to the blade holder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to sandwich the blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> between the holder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the bottom cover. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the blade holder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a non-circular aperture <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the top thereof to receive a drive mechanism <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Typically, as shown in several of the patents cited above and incorporated herein by reference, the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is a rod offset mounted on a rotating shaft. The rod has a diameter substantially the same as the width of the aperture <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Rotation of the shaft causes the rod to rotate in a circular path, which in turn causes lateral oscillation of the blade assembly in the microkeratome. This oscillating motion is intended to improve the quality of the cut made by the sharp edge <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this instance, the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> enters the aperture <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a substantially vertical manner but at an angle to the plane of the blade. This embodiment is designed for use in a microtome manufactured by Bausch &amp; Lomb and referred to as the HANSATOME&trade;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> are to a second embodiment of the blade assembly which incorporates the blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> with a different designed blade holder <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for use in the C-B&trade; microkeratome manufactured by Moria. This blade assembly also receives a substantially vertical drive mechanism <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. However, because the aperture <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be a slot or oval, the blade assembly can receive a drive mechanism <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> mounted in other than a vertical manner and still function in substantially the same manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> show a third embodiment designed to receive a drive from other than the vertical. The drive <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may in fact be parallel to the plane of the blade, as shown in some of the above referenced patents. In such an instance, the blade may be held in the keratome at an angle to the vertical, or horizontal. Like components are numbered the same as in the prior figures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A variation of the blade of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and the holder of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In this variation the holder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has holes <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> therethrough. While the hole <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has been shown as round, any shape hole can be used. The purpose of the hole <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> in the holder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is to assure proper alignment of the holder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on a machining fixture (not shown) when the holder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is positioned or refixtured for the machining of the indented blade receiving portion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. This assures proper location or registration of the blade with the slot <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the assembled product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the blade holder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can also have a groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> therein so that one blade of a forceps or tweezer can be inserted therein to grasp the blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for placement of the blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with attached blade holder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in to the microkeratome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows the extensions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as circular pieces extending from the sides, the extensions can be of various different shapes designed to mate with a like shape in the holder. While shown to be in the plane of the blade <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the extensions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can also be at an angle to the plane or be perpendicular to the plane for insertion in matching holes extending into the holder. It is also contemplated that the blade may be fabricated from a material other than stainless steel, such as ceramics, zirconium, sapphire or similar material, or may have coatings on the beveled front edge to aid in creating a smooth cut in the corneal tissue. It is also possible for the blade and blade holder to be fabricated as a single piece with front edge treated to produce a suitable cutting surface or to receive a cutting component, such as a sapphire, or diamond, ceramic or zirconium, cutting edge, such as typically used in other ophthalmic tissue cutting tools. A typical material for construction of the blade holder is acetal (Delrin&reg;), nylon or other engineering plastics which can be formed or machined into structures with dimensions having controlled tolerances. It is also possible that the holder and blade could be formed of a single engineering plastic capable of forming or being formed into a sharp forward blade edge. Still further, the whole assembly could be of a hard material, such as a ceramic material, which can be honed to a sharp edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> show additional embodiments of the blade. The overall shape of the blade <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is parabolic with a front portion thereof removed to form a sharp front edge <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The blade <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is placed in a holder <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> fabricated with an indented portion for receiving the blade <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with extensions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the manner as described in the regard to the embodiments described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As set forth above, the extensions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be of any shape. Also, if they are circular extensions, they preferably include at least about 180&deg; of arc to provide a secure registration of the blade in the holder. The dimensions of the parabolic shape of the blade can be varied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Still further, the blade shape does not have to be parabolic or circular but can be oval (elliptical) in shape or have a compound curved surface. It can also have more than two extensions. </paragraph>
