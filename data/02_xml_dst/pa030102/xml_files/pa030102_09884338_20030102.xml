<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method for monitoring efficiency of an exhaust gas aftertreatment device is presented. The efficiency is inferred from the amount of fuel required to perform purge of the device after it has been saturated with exhaust gas components such as NOx and oxygen to a predetermined level. The level of saturation is determined from the amount of tailpipe emissions as indicated by the tailpipe exhaust gas sensor. This method improves precision in determining device efficiency and therefore eliminates unnecessary sulfur purges and improves fuel economy. Also, better emission control is achieved since the tailpipe exhaust gas sensor allows closed loop monitoring of NOx emissions and prevents the device from overfilling. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a system and a method for estimating efficiency of an exhaust gas aftertreatment device and, more particularly, to estimating an exhaust gas component storage capacity of a Lean NOx Trap coupled downstream of an internal combustion engine. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Internal combustion engines are typically coupled to an emission control device known as a three-way catalytic converter (TWC) designed to reduce combustion by-products such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Engines can operate at air-fuel mixture ratios lean of stoichiometry, thus improving fuel economy. For lean engine operation, an additional three-way catalyst commonly referred to as a Lean NOx Trap (LNT), is usually coupled downstream of an upstream catalytic converter. The LNT stores exhaust components, such as oxygen and NOx, during lean operation. After the LNT is filled, stored exhaust gas components are typically reduced and purged by switching to rich or stoichiometric operation, i.e., by increasing the ratio of fuel to air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Over time, the ability of the catalyst to store exhaust gas components can decrease due to such factors as sulfur deposits (SOx) from the fuel. Therefore, when the storage capacity is sufficiently reduced, a SOx purge has to be performed. Typically, the catalyst is heated and engine air-fuel ratio is changed to rich for SOx release and reduction. Since SOx purges result in fuel economy penalties, it is desirable not to purge unnecessarily. Thus, in order to maintain adherence to emission standards and to obtain fuel economy benefits of a lean burning engine, it is desirable to monitor the efficiency of the LNT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One method of determining the efficiency of the catalyst is by inferring it from the amount of fuel required to perform a NOx purge as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,713,199. In particular, the method involves saturating the NOx absorbent with NOx up to a predetermined amount (based on an engine model), and allegedly calculating the amount of NOx purge fuel as the difference between total fuel required to purge the NOx absorbent of stored NOx and oxygen, and oxygen purge fuel (determined separately). The amount of NOx purge fuel is then correlated to the device&apos;s efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The inventors herein have recognized a disadvantage with this approach. Namely, the prior art method uses an engine model to determine the amount of NOx required to saturate the NOx storage device to capacity. However, different operating conditions, such as high or low humidity, may cause this amount to vary significantly. For example, at high humidity levels NOx generation rate is lower than that at low humidity. Therefore, the prior art method may indicate that the LNT is filled to capacity when that may not be the case. Since the fill level of the LNT may not be accurate, the calculated amount of purge fuel required to release and reduce stored NOx may not be accurate either. As a result, it may not be possible to precisely monitor the LNT efficiency. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In solving the above problem, a system and a method are provided for monitoring the efficiency of an exhaust gas aftertreatment device by calculating the amount of purge fuel required to release the exhaust gas components stored in the device during lean operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In carrying out the above solution, features and advantages of the present invention, a system and a method for monitoring en efficiency of an exhaust gas aftertreatment device disposed in an exhaust passage of an internal combustion engine, the device having a sensor coupled downstream of it, include operating the engine at an air-fuel mixture lean of stoichiometry; indicating that the device has stored more than a preselected quantity of an exhaust gas component based on an output of the sensor; in response to said indication, switching engine operation to an air-fuel ratio rich of stoichiometry to release said stored exhaust gas components from the device; and calculating an amount of said stored exhaust gas components stored in the device based on an amount of fuel required to complete said release. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a number of advantages. For example, the present invention is much more precise at estimating the efficiency of the LNT since it allows filling the LNT with oxidants to a known level by monitoring the output of the sensor coupled downstream of the LNT, as opposed to the prior art method of assuming the fill level of the LNT based on an engine model. Also, the estimate is made more accurate by the fact that less error is introduced by calculating the fuel required to purge all stored oxidants from the LNT as opposed to the prior art method of calculating NOx and oxygen purge fuel separately. The improved precision will prevent unnecessary purges allowing for more lean running time, and increased fuel economy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Yet another advantage of the present invention is that monitoring, rather than assuming, the state of the LNT prevents overfilling it with oxidants and possibly releasing some in the atmosphere. Therefore, better emission control is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The above advantages and other advantages, objects and features of the present invention will be readily apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the present invention is independent of the particular underlying engine technology and configuration. As such, the present invention may be used in a variety of types of internal combustion engines, such as conventional engines, in addition to direct injection stratified charge (DISC) or direct injection spark ignition engines (DISI). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A block diagram illustrating an engine control system and method for a representative internal combustion engine according to the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Preferably, such an engine includes a plurality of combustion chambers, only one of which is shown, and is controlled by electronic engine controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Combustion chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes combustion chamber walls <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> positioned therein and connected to crankshaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In this particular example, the piston <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a recess or bowl (not shown) for forming stratified charges of air and fuel. In addition, combustion chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is shown communicating with intake manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and exhaust manifold <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> via respective intake valves <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(not shown), and exhaust valves <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(not shown). A fuel injector <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is shown directly coupled to combustion chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for delivering liquid fuel directly therein in proportion to the pulse width of signal fpw received from controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via conventional electronic driver <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Fuel is delivered to the fuel injector <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> by a conventional high-pressure fuel system (not shown) including a fuel tank, fuel pumps, and a fuel rail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Intake manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is shown communicating with throttle body <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> via throttle plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. In this particular example, the throttle plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is coupled to electric motor <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> such that the position of the throttle plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is controlled by controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via electric motor <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. This configuration is commonly referred to as electronic throttle control, (ETC), which is also utilized during idle speed control. In an alternative embodiment (not shown), which is well known to those skilled in the art, a bypass air passageway is arranged in parallel with throttle plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to control inducted airflow during idle speed control via a throttle control valve positioned within the air passageway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Exhaust gas sensor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is shown coupled to exhaust manifold <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> upstream of catalytic converter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In this particular example, sensor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is a universal exhaust gas oxygen (UEGO) sensor, also known as a proportional oxygen sensor. The UEGO sensor generates a signal whose magnitude is proportional to the oxygen level (and the air-fuel ratio) in the exhaust gases. This signal is provided to controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which converts it into a relative air-fuel ratio. Advantageously, signal UEGO is used during feedback air-fuel ratio control in to maintain average air-fuel ratio at a desired air-fuel ratio as described later herein. In an alternative embodiment, sensor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can provide signal EGO, exhaust gas oxygen (not shown), which indicates whether exhaust air-fuel ratio is lean or rich of stoichiometry. In another alternate embodiment, the sensor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may comprise one of a carbon monoxide (CO) sensor, a hydrocarbon (HC) sensor, and a NOx sensor that generates a signal whose magnitude is related to the level of CO, HC, NOx, respectively, in the exhaust gases. Those skilled in the art will recognize that any of the above exhaust gas sensors may be viewed as an air-fuel ratio sensor that generates a signal whose magnitude is indicative of the air-fuel ratio measured in exhaust gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Conventional distributorless ignition system <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> provides ignition spark to combustion chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via spark plug <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> in response to spark advance signal SA from controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> causes combustion chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to operate in either a homogeneous air-fuel ratio mode or a stratified air-fuel ratio mode by controlling injection timing. In the stratified mode, controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> activates fuel injector <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> during the engine compression stroke so that fuel is sprayed directly into the bowl of piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Stratified air-fuel layers are thereby formed. The stratum closest to the spark plug contains a stoichiometric mixture or a mixture slightly rich of stoichiometry, and subsequent strata contain progressively leaner mixtures. In the homogeneous mode, controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> activates fuel injector <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> during the intake stroke so that a substantially homogeneous air-fuel mixture is formed when ignition power is supplied to spark plug <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> by ignition system <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> controls the amount of fuel delivered by fuel injector <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> so that the homogeneous air-fuel ratio mixture in chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be selected to be substantially at (or near) stoichiometry, a value rich of stoichiometry, or a value lean of stoichiometry. Operation substantially at (or near) stoichiometry refers to conventional closed loop oscillatory control about stoichiometry. The stratified air-fuel ratio mixture will always be at a value lean of stoichiometry, the exact air-fuel ratio being a function of the amount of fuel delivered to combustion chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> An additional split mode of operation, wherein additional fuel is injected during the exhaust stroke while operating in the stratified mode, is available. An additional split mode of operation wherein additional fuel is injected during the intake stroke while operating in the stratified mode is also available, where a combined homogeneous and split mode is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Lean NOx Trap <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is shown positioned downstream of catalytic converter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Both devices store exhaust gas components, such as NO and oxidants, when engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating lean of stoichiometry. The stored exhaust gas components are subsequently reacted with HC and other reductant and are catalyzed during a purge cycle when controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> causes engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to operate in either a rich mode or a near stoichiometric mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Exhaust gas oxygen sensor <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> also known as a catalyst monitoring sensor (CMS) is shown coupled to exhaust manifold <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> between the catalytic converter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the NOx trap <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In this particular example, sensor <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> provides signal HEGO to controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and essentially serves as a switch providing information as to whether the air-fuel mixture is lean or rich at the mid-bed location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as a conventional microcomputer including but not limited to: microprocessor unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, input/output ports <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, an electronic storage medium for executable programs and calibration values, shown as read-only memory chip <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in this particular example, random access memory <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, keep alive memory <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and a conventional data bus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown receiving various signals from sensors coupled to engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in addition to those signals previously discussed, including: measurement of inducted mass air flow (MAF) from mass air flow sensor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> coupled to throttle body <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>; engine coolant temperature (ECT) from temperature sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> coupled to cooling sleeve <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>; a profile ignition pickup signal (PIP) from Hall effect sensor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> coupled to crankshaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> giving an indication of engine speed (RPM); throttle position TP from throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>; and absolute Manifold Pressure Signal MAP from sensor <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Engine speed signal RPM is generated by controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from signal PIP in a conventional manner and manifold pressure signal MAP provides an indication of engine load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Fuel system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is coupled to intake manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> via tube <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Fuel vapors (not shown) generated in fuel system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> pass through tube <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and are controlled via purge valve <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Purge valve <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> receives control signal PRG from controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Exhaust sensor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is a NOx/UEGO sensor located downstream of the LNT. It produces two output signals. Both first output signal (SIGNAL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and second output signal (SIGNAL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are received by controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Exhaust sensor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be a sensor known to those skilled in the art that is capable of indicating both exhaust air-fuel ratio and nitrogen oxide concentration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, SIGNAL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> indicates exhaust air-fuel ratio and SIGNAL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> indicates nitrogen oxide concentration. In this embodiment, sensor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> has a first chamber (not shown) in which exhaust gas first enters where a measurement of oxygen partial pressure is generated from a first pumping current. Also, in the first chamber, oxygen partial pressure of the exhaust gas is controlled to a predetermined level. Exhaust air-fuel ratio can then be indicated based on this first pumping current. Next, the exhaust gas enters a second chamber (not shown) where NO<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>is decomposed and measured by a second pumping current using the predetermined level. Nitrogen oxide concentration can then be indicated based on this second pumping current. In an alternative embodiment, a separate NOx sensor could be used in conjunction with an air-fuel sensor, which could be a UEGO or a HEGO sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> generally represents operation of one embodiment of a system or method according to the present invention. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the diagram may represent one or more of any number of processing strategies such as event-driven, interrupt-driven, multi-tasking, multi-threading, and the like. As such, various steps or functions illustrated may be performed in the sequence illustrated, I parallel, or in some cases omitted. Likewise, the order of processing is not necessarily required to achieve the objects, features and advantages of the invention, but is provided for ease of illustration and description. Although not explicitly illustrated, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that one or more of the illustrated steps or functions may be repeatedly performed depending on the particular strategy being used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the routine begins in step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> wherein the engine is operated rich is order to purge any stored exhaust gas components from the catalyst thus starting with a known state of the device, and lean operation commences. Next, in step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, an accumulated measure TP_NOx_INT representing the total tailpipe NOx emissions (in grams) since the start of lean operation is determined based upon the adjusted output signal TP_NOx generated by the NOx sensor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> according to the following equation:

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The routine then exits. The LNT efficiency information can be used to provide feedback to the engine controller to initiate a sulfur purge of the LNT when it is determined that it is sufficiently diminished. It can also be used for compliance with OBDII monitoring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In other words, the efficiency of the LNT is inferred from the ratio of the amount of fuel required to perform the latest purge to the amount of fuel required to purge the LNT when at top capacity (within 10 miles of latest desulfication event, in this example). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the present invention, it is possible to monitor the efficiency of a three-way catalyst such as an LNT by calculating the amount of fuel required to purge it of stored oxidants after it has been filled with oxidants up to a predetermined amount as indicated by a sensor coupled downstream of it. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, this is accomplished by performing a purge of the LNT followed by a switch to lean operation. During lean operation, the total tailpipe NOx emission per distance traveled is calculated using the output of the tailpipe NOx sensor. Once this value exceeds a target emission amount, lean operation is discontinued, and engine operation is switched to rich therefore purging the LNT of stored exhaust gas components such as NOx and oxygen. The LNT efficiency is then determined as a function of the ratio of the net fuel amount required to purge the it of stored NOx and oxygen to the net purge fuel amount when at maximum efficiency (within a predetermined traveling distance after the last desulfication event). </paragraph>
