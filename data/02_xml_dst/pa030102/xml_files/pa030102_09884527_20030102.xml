<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> A fuel cell is an energy conversion device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy. The fuel cell generates electricity and heat by electrochemically combining a fluid fuel, such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, or a hydrocarbon, and an oxidant, such as air or oxygen, across an ion-conducting electrolyte. The fuel cell generally consists of two electrodes positioned on opposite sides of an electrolyte. The oxidant passes over the oxygen electrode (cathode) while the fuel passes over the fuel electrode (anode), generating electricity, water, and heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is constructed entirely of solid-state materials, utilizing an ion conductive oxide ceramic as the electrolyte. A conventional electrochemical cell in a SOFC comprises an anode and a cathode with an electrolyte disposed therebetween. In a typical SOFC, a fuel flows to the anode where it is oxidized by oxygen ions from the electrolyte, producing electrons that are released to the external circuit, and mostly water and carbon dioxide are removed in the fuel flow stream. At the cathode, the oxidant accepts electrons from the external circuit to form oxygen ions. The oxygen ions migrate across the electrolyte to the anode. The flow of electrons through the external circuit provides for consumable or storable electricity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A SOFC stack operates at temperatures of about 600&deg; C. to 1,200&deg; C. Since the SOFC stack operates at high temperatures, it requires a large amount of time to heat up to efficient operating temperatures. In order to have a faster and more efficient startup, the SOFC stack can be pre-heated to reduce the time required to reach operating temperatures. However, the conventional methods of heating the SOFC do not evenly heat the SOFC stack. Conventional methods can include directing heated gases through the SOFC stack prior to startup. However, this method of pre-heating does not evenly heat the SOFC stack creating wide temperature gradients. The materials of the SOFC stack cannot handle the wide temperature gradients and thus, performance is hindered and damage to the SOFC stack can result. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A SOFC operates at high temperatures (generally from about 600&deg; C. to about 1,200&deg; C.) requiring durable materials that can conduct electrical energy at high temperatures. An interconnect can provide a SOFC stack with a surface area that heats up quickly from cold start (e.g., about &minus;40&deg; C. to about 30&deg; C.) and radiates the thermal energy for use by the SOFC stack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Different types of SOFC systems exist, including tubular and planar systems. These various systems operate with different cell configurations. Therefore, reference to a particular cell configuration and components for use within a particular cell configuration are intended to also represent similar components in other cell configurations where applicable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> One configuration of a SOFC includes a stack of planar SOFCs. A single conventional SOFC is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A fuel electrode (or anode) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and an oxygen electrode (or cathode) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are disposed on opposite sides of a solid electrolyte <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to form an electrochemical cell <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An end cap <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is configured for disposal adjacent to the anode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for both electrical contact and also to provide fuel distribution. An interconnect <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a first interconnect surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and a second interconnect surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Surface <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is configured for disposal adjacent to the cathode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to provide oxidant distribution and electrical contact, and surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is configured for disposal adjacent to anode <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of another electrochemical cell. Anode <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is disposed adjacent to interconnect <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to illustrate the placement of and ability to stack several electrochemical cells connected to electrochemical cell <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The solid electrolyte <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the electrochemical cell <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be an ion conductor capable of transporting oxygen ions from the cathode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the anode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and which is compatible with the environment in which the SOFC will be utilized (e.g., temperatures of up to about 1,200&deg; C.). Generally, solid electrolyte materials include materials, such as ceramics (e.g., perovskite, fluorite, and the like), metals (e.g., zirconium, yttrium, calcium, cerium, magnesium, aluminum, rare earths, and the like), as well as oxides, gallates, aluminates, combinations, and composites comprising at least one of the foregoing materials. Preferably the electrolyte is a rare earth oxide (such as yttria, gadolinia, neodymia, ytterbia, erbia, ceria, and the like) doped with aliovalient oxide(s) (such as magnesia, calcia, strontia, and the like, and other <highlight><superscript>&plus;</superscript></highlight>2 valence metal oxides). More preferably, a yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte is utilized in the SOFC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The anode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and cathode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which form phase boundaries (gas/electrolyte/catalyst particle; commonly known as triple points) with the electrolyte <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, can be disposed adjacent to or integral with the electrolyte <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The anode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and cathode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are generally formed of a porous material capable of functioning as an electrical conductor and capable of facilitating the appropriate reactions. The porosity of these materials should be sufficient to enable dual directional flow of gases (e.g., to admit the fuel or oxidant gases and to permit exit of the byproduct gases), with a porosity of up to about 40% useful, and about 20% to about 40% typically preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The composition of the anode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and cathode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can comprise elements such as zirconium, yttrium, nickel, manganese, strontium, lanthanum, and oxides, alloys, and combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing elements. Preferably, the anode material is formed upon a ceramic skeleton, such as yttria-stabilized zirconia, for thermal compatibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Both the anode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the cathode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be formed on the electrolyte <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> by a variety of techniques including sputtering, chemical vapor deposition, screen printing, spraying, dipping, painting, and stenciling, among others. The electrodes are typically up to about 1,000 micrometers (&mgr;m) or so in thickness, with a thickness of about 10 &mgr;m to about 50 &mgr;m typically preferred. An anode supported cell can also be used by forming the electrolyte <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the cathode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on the anode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by any of the above techniques. Alternate constructions are also contemplated with the cathode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or an inert layer (not shown) substituted as the support for the electrochemical cell <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Each individual electrochemical cell <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprising a single anode <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a single electrolyte <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a single cathode <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, generates a relatively small voltage as calculated using the Nerst equation of electrochemistry. This results in a voltage of less than about 1.2 volts direct current, with greater than about 0.5 volts preferred. A single electrochemical cell <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can have a voltage output of less than or equal to about 1.2 volts, based upon the electrical load applied to the electrochemical cell <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Higher system voltages are attained by electrically connecting a plurality of electrochemical cells in series to form a stack. The total number of cells forming a stack can range from 2 to several hundred, depending on power requirements, space and weight restrictions, economics, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The electrochemical cell <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be electrically connected with other electrochemical cells using interconnects <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The interconnects <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are typically, but not limited to, a flat plate structure. Depending upon the geometry of the SOFC, the fuel and the oxidant flow to the anode or cathode (as appropriate) via the one or more passageways or flow sections (commonly referred to as manifolds) <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that border the edge of the interconnect <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The interconnects <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are preferably stable and electrically conductive at about 800&deg; C. in a dual environment (e.g., an oxidizing atmosphere on one side and a reducing atmosphere on the other side). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Each interconnect <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be an electrically conductive material that is compatible with the oxidizing or reducing nature of the fuel cell environment. For example, suitable interconnects can be ceramic, metallic, or the like, as well as composites, cermets, alloys, and combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing materials, in the form of plates, foils, felts, mats, fibers (chopped, woven, non-woven, long, and the like), and the like, and combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing forms. Preferably, the material is capable of withstanding transportation vehicle operating conditions (e.g., ambient temperatures of about &minus;40&deg; C. up to SOFC operating temperatures of up to about 1,200&deg; C.). Some possible interconnects can comprise materials such as silver, copper, ferrous materials, strontium, lanthanum, chromium, chrome, gold, platinum, palladium, nickel, titanium, conducting ceramics (e.g., doped rare earth oxides of lanthanum, chromium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, and the like; doped zirconia, including, zirconia doped with titanium, copper, and the like), and the like, as well as alloys, oxides, cermets, composites, and combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing materials. Preferably, the interconnect <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> comprise a ferrous material such as stainless steel, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An interconnect can serve as a heating element to provide for a uniform heating of the SOFC stack particularly from cold start. Heating one or more, preferably all of the interconnects can enable more uniform heating of the SOFC. However, interconnects with a thickness of about 1 millimeter (mm) or so, need a current of about 1,500 amperes per interconnect or so to sufficiently heat the SOFC (i.e., to heat to a temperature of about 700&deg; C. in about 20 minutes). A thinner interconnect will increase the resistance of an interconnect, allowing for a reduction in the current for the same power. Additionally, a thinner interconnect will need less power to attain the same temperature in the same amount of time since there is less mass to heat. The interconnect can have a thickness up to about 1 mm or so, with a thickness of up to about 0.5 mm preferred, and up to about 0.05 mm even more preferred. Additionally, the interconnect should have a sufficient thickness to maintain the desired structural integrity and to provide the desired flow channels for the fuel and oxidant. Preferably, the interconnect has a thickness of greater than or equal to about 0.01 mm, with less than or equal to about 0.03 mm preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> For comparison, Table 1 presents the characteristics of applying a current to heat three SOFCs, each having 60 electrochemical cells. Three SOFCs trials were completed (A, B, and C), each having interconnects of varying thickness (1 mm, 0.1 mm, and 0.05 mm, respectively). In each trial, the interconnects: comprised steel; were 100 mm in length and 100 mm in width; and had a specific heat of 0.51 J/g-K, a resistivity of 0.15, and a density of 7.9 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. The time allowed to heat for each trial was 300 seconds.

<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As Table 1 indicates, the thinner the interconnect, the greater the resistance, which allows for a reduced amount of current. For example, trial A has an interconnect having a thickness of 1 mm and a resistance of 0.15 ohms/cell, while trial C has an interconnect having a thickness of 0.05 mm and a resistance of 3 ohms/cell. This translates into a lesser amount of current being required for SOFC of Trial C, in comparison to the SOFC of Trial A, in order to heat the interconnect (1.2 amperes/cell (A/cell) vs. 24.1 A/cell). Preferably, the interconnect has a resistance of greater than or equal to about 1.2 ohms/cell, with greater than or equal to about 2 ohms/cell more preferred, and greater than or equal to about 3 ohms/cell even more preferred. Also preferred is a power to heat the interconnect of less than or equal to about 6 watts/cell, with less than or equal to about 5 watts/cell more preferred, and about less than or equal to about 4.5 watts/cell even more preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In each of the trials, the total current was measured to determine the amperes required for the particular SOFC stack to operate the thin, heated interconnect. Less power (about 72.4 amperes/stack (A/stack)) was required for Trial C when compared to Trial B (about 144.7 A/stack) and Trial A (about 1,447.4 A/stack). Likewise, the total heating power of Trial C (about 261.8 watts/stack (W/stack)) was less when compared to Trial B (about 523.7 W/stack) and Trial A (about 5,237.7 W/stack). This indicates that a thinner (e.g., 0.05 mm) electrically heated interconnect requires less power to heat. Consequently, thinner interconnects are preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The use of a heatable thin interconnect in a SOFC stack <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Electrochemical cells <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are separated by interconnects <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Several switches, as illustrated by representative switches <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, can optionally be disposed, preferably in parallel in electrical communication with interconnects <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. A power supply <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can optionally provide electricity to interconnects <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>; e.g., via the use of a controller (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The power supply <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can comprise any available electrical power source. Some possible sources include stored energy in the vehicle (e.g., a battery, or the like), a vehicle power source (e.g., power from the vehicle alternator (when running)), a connection to an external energy source (e.g., off vehicle battery or other electrical supply (e.g., power grid), and the like), as well as combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing power sources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The power supply <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> provides power to the interconnects <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> independently heating each interconnect. Preferably, each interconnect is heated to a temperature of greater than or equal to about 600&deg; C., with greater than or equal to 700&deg; C. preferred. Preferably, each interconnect is heated to a temperature of less than or equal to about 800&deg; C., with less than or equal to about 775&deg; C. more preferred. Essentially, the interconnect acts as a heating element to heat up each electrochemical cell to a desired temperature to allow for startup of the SOFC stack. Preferably, the interconnect is heated to a sufficient temperature to heat the SOFC to a temperature of greater than or equal to about 700&deg; C. in less than or equal to about 20 minutes, with greater than or equal to about 750&deg; C. in less than or equal to about 10 minutes preferred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The heating of each interconnect provides a more uniform heating of the SOFC stack. Consequently, although the interconnects can be controlled separately to enable heating of selected interconnects, preferably, all of the interconnects are heated simultaneously. The heating of interconnects can be controlled by the regulation of switches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A method of using the heated interconnect involves supplying power to each interconnect. The electricity is distributed to the interconnects by a switch that controls the supply of electricity to the interconnect. Once the interconnect reaches a sufficient temperature, as defined above, the switch opens stopping the flow of electricity. Optionally, the switches can be controlled by a time schedule, based upon temperature sensors (at the interconnect and/or at the electrochemical cell), computer controlled, or &ldquo;inherent&rdquo; (e.g., PTC resistors, and the like). At this point, the SOFC stack is at a sufficient temperature to proceed to starting the SOFC system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The heated interconnect provides a more uniform method of heating the mass of the SOFC stack. Disposing the interconnect between each SOFC electrochemical cell provides for blocking electrical communication between the cells, as well as providing a mechanism by which the SOFC stack can be heated to startup temperatures. The individual heating capability of the interconnect prevents wide temperature gradients across the SOFC stack commonly associated with other methods. Electrically heating the interconnect allows for rapid and uniform heating of the cell stack. Additionally, the thin interconnect requires less power to heat since there is less mass to heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this invention, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.</paragraph>
