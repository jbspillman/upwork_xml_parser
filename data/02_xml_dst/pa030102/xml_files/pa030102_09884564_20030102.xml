<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of optical gyroscopes. More specifically, the invention relates to the magnetic shielding of an optical gyroscope. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A key performance parameter for optical gyroscopes, such as fiber optic and similar optic gyroscopes used for inertial sensing, is bias sensitivity to magnetic fields. Sources of magnetic flux include the Earth&apos;s magnetic field, electrical machinery, etc. For a fiber gyroscope used in inertial navigation systems, the allowable magnetic sensitivity of the instrument bias is between 0.001 and 0.0001 degree per hour per guass (deg/hr/guass). The inherent sensitivity of an unshielded gyroscope is <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> deg/hr/gauss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The most effective method to reduce the bias sensitivity to magnetic field is to reduce the magnitude of the local field by the addition of a magnetically shielding structure (&ldquo;magnetic shield&rdquo;) around the optics. Magnetic shields are made of a high permeability shielding material that will function as a preferred path for an ambient field. Essentially, the magnetic shield creates a high-permeability path for the magnetic field in order to reroute the magnetic field around the optical gyroscope inside the shield, thereby reducing the effect on bias. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Performance of the magnetic shield is determined by the overall size, shape, and composition of the container, as well as magnitude of the ambient field. One variable included in the size and shape, is the number of distinct layers of shielding material present in the shield. These layers are separated from each other by a non-magnetic material or by a vacancy. One variable which affects the performance of a multi-layered shield is the size of this gap between the shield layers. Another performance variable is the mating method of multi-piece shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Presently, magnetic shields are usually two-piece assemblies, namely a lid and a base, where one piece overlaps the other. This overlapping results in the inside layer of the lid mating on the outside surface of the outer layer of the base. This overlap creates a discontinuity in the ambient field paths created by each shielding layer. Thus, the result is not a true multi-layered shielding effect since there are not separate paths that the magnetic field lines can travel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a magnetic shield having a multiple-layered lid and a multiple layered base, wherein each layer of the lid is aligned with the corresponding layer of the base to create a continuous multi-layered shield throughout the joint of the lid and the base of the shield. The present invention provides such a mated shield with a true multi-layered shielding effect, which results in improved suppression of the magnetic field surrounding the gyroscope. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is further desirable to provide an alignment mechanism to maintain the mating of the lid and the base of a magnetic shield while the shield is in use. The present invention provides such an alignment mechanism. In the present invention, the alignment mechanism ensures that the continuous ambient fields created by the layers of a shield will not be disrupted during the use of a gyroscope. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a magnetic shield having a multiple-layered lid and a multiple layered base, wherein each layer of the lid is aligned with the corresponding layer of the base. The present invention also provides an alignment mechanism to maintain the alignment of the corresponding layers of the lid and the base of the shield. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings, FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> show a preferred embodiment of a magnetic shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention. The magnetic shield generally comprises a base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a lid <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and an alignment mechanism <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. It should be understood, however, that the magnetic shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be comprised of fewer or more components, depending on manufacturing and consumer preferences. Furthermore, while the magnetic shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is cylindrical in shape, it should be understood by those of skill in the art that the shape and size of the magnetic shield will vary depending upon the shape and size of the gyroscope being enclosed by the shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a bottom end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and side walls <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Both the bottom end and the side walls of the base of the magnetic shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably comprise at least a first layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, having an inner surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and an outer surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a second layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, having an inner surface <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and an outer surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. A layer of air <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> separates the first layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the second layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the bottom end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and side walls <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the base are integral to each other, with side walls <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> outwardly extending from the bottom end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. However, it should be understood that a base in which the bottom end and the side walls are connected, but not integral (i.e., separate), may also be used with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The lid <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the magnetic shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably has a top end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and side walls <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Both the top end and the side walls of the lid preferably comprise at least a first layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, having an inner surface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and an outer surface <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and a second layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, having an inner surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and an outer surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. A layer of air <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> preferably separates the first layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and second layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the lid <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As with the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the top end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and side walls <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the lid <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are, preferably, integral to each other, with the side walls <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> outwardly extending from the top end <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. However, it should be understood that a lid in which the top end and the sides are connected, but not integral (i.e., separate), may be used with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The lid <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is defined as the portion of the shield which includes the top end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the magnetic shield. Likewise, the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is defined as the portion of the shield which includes the bottom end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the magnetic shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The layers of the lid and the base are preferably made of high permeability shielding material, such as wrought nickel-iron soft magnetic alloys. More preferably, the layers of the lid and base are made of nickel-iron alloys falling under military specification MIL-N-14411 (composition 1 &amp; 2) or American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) specification A753-97, both of which are specifically incorporated herein by reference. However, the same shielding material need not be used for both the inner and the outer layers. Preferably, the inner layer of the lid is composed of the same material as the corresponding layer in the base, and the outer layer of the lid is composed of the same material as the corresponding layer in the base. Furthermore, additional layers of high permeability shielding material may be added between the inner and outer layers. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows an alternative embodiment of the present invention where an intermediate layer of shielding material <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is positioned between the outer surface of the inner layer and the inner surface of the outer layer. Hence, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> triple-layer or magnetic shield may be used in this invention. It is also contemplated that more than three layers may be used with the magnetic shield of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The inner and outer layers of the shield are often separated by a layer of air <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Although not shown, a layer of low magnetic permeability material may be situated between the high magnetic permeability layers in addition to or in place of the layer of air. This low magnetic permeability layer may be made of any non-ferrous material, such as copper, aluminum, stainless steel or plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The alignment mechanism <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> functions to maintain alignment of the layers of the lid with the corresponding layers of the base at the joint of the lid <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, as exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the alignment mechanism is a band of material having a upper portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and a lower portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. This band may be affixed to the shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in any manner or orientation that maintains the alignment of the layers of the lid <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, the upper portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the band may be affixed to the outer surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the second layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the lid <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>; the upper portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the band may be affixed to the inner surface <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the first layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the lid <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>; the lower portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the band may be affixed to the outer surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the second layer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>; or the lower portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the band may be affixed to the inner surface <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the first layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, more than one band may be affixed to the shield to maintain this alignment. This is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, where a first band is attached to the outside surface of the second layer and a second band is attached to the inner surface of the first layer. This type of alignment mechanism gives the additional benefit of connecting the shield layers where discontinuities occur caused by tolerancing and manufacturing, thereby further improving the performance of the shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Although a band of material is the preferred alignment mechanism, those of skill in the art will understand that the alignment mechanism may be any type of mechanism which will maintain the alignment of the layers of the lid and the layers of the base during the use of the magnetic shield. Such alternative alignment mechanisms may include one or more flanges, clasps, clips or hinges. Each of these alternative alignment mechanisms preferably will have an upper portion and a lower portion, with either portion being affixed to the shield in a manner which maintains the alignment of the lid and the base. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is an example of a shield of the present invention having a flange as the alignment mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Each alignment mechanism is preferably made of a high permeability shielding material, such as wrought nickel-iron soft magnetic alloys. More preferably, the layers of the lid and base are made of nickel-iron alloys falling under military specification MIL-N-14411 (composition 1 &amp; 2) or American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) specification A753-97. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the alignment mechanism is composed of the same material as the layer of the shield to which it is affixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The magnetic shield of the present invention may be used in the following manner. The layers of the lid of the shield are mated with the corresponding layers of the base of the shield to ensure continuous contact between each layer of the lid and the base. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> the inner layer of the lid is aligned with the inner layer of the base such that these inner layers are in contact at the joint of the lid and base. Likewise, the outer layer of the lid is aligned with the outer layer of the base such that these outer layers are in contact at the joint of the lid and base. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In order to maintain this alignment of the shield layers during the use of the shield, the present invention utilizes an alignment mechanism, such as a thin band. The alignment mechanism holds the lid and the base in place with respect to one another, thereby keeping their layers aligned, and preventing them from becoming misaligned due to movement by either the lid or the base. This alignment of the layers of the lid with the layers of the base results in continuous ambient fields created by the layers of the magnetic shield. The ambient fields are a redirection of the magnetic fields surrounding the gyroscope, thereby reducing the effect on the gyroscope from these magnetic fields. This reduced sensitivity gives the gyroscope improved accuracy and reduces the chance of a sudden error due to an exposure to a magnetic field. Furthermore, the magnetic shield is also electrically conductive, which imparts some electrical shielding for the electronic components of the gyroscope inside the shield. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that a wide range of changes and modifications can be made to the embodiments of the magnetic shield described above. For instance, the size and shape of the magnetic shield, the materials used to create the magnetic shield, the number of layers used in the shield and the type of alignment mechanism utilized with the magnetic shield, may be different than the exemplary embodiments described above, depending upon consumer and manufacturing preferences. It is therefore intended that the foregoing description illustrates rather than limits this invention, and that it is the following claims, including all equivalents, which define this invention. </paragraph>
