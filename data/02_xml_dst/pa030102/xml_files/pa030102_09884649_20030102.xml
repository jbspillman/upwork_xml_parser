</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to sectorized wireless communication systems, and more particularly, to methods and systems for providing adjustable sector configurations across wireless cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As wireless communications become more widely used, the demand for limited wireless resources, such as the finite number of frequency bands, time divisions, and/or identifying codes (collectively referred to herein as &ldquo;channels&rdquo;) have increased significantly. It should be appreciated that channels may be distinguishable based on the particular air interface standard implemented such as the frequency bands of frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time slots of time division multiple access (TDMA and W-TDMA), pseudo random codes of code division multiple access (CDMA and W-CDMA), and the like. In order to more efficiently use these available resources, wireless communication systems typically divide a geographic area into multiple overlapping coverage cells, which are each served by a base station. Each base station typically comprises a tower, one or more antenna, and radio equipment to allow wireless communication devices to connect with the network side of a wireless communications link. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Conventional wireless communication systems utilize a variety of schemes for providing comprehensive coverage of an area while providing sufficient communication capacity without an undesirable level of interference. For example, one scheme includes using particular antenna radiation patterns such as sectorization. Using narrow-beam antennas, a coverage cell may be divided into smaller areas, called sectors, each having a specific radial coverage area within the cell. The antenna(s) defining a particular sector provide wireless communication capacity to wireless devices within the sectors&apos; specific radial coverage area. In addition, sectors are typically configured to overlap with adjacent sectors to provide seamless communications to wireless devices moving between sectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a conventional wireless communication system, a cell is typically broken into three to six equal sectors. However, the coverage area or shape of the sectors typically depends upon the geographic area the sector comprises. In other words, even with the same antenna array and transmitting power configuration, the shape of each sector typically differs based on such factors as climatic changes, differences in terrain, development, etc. For example, a sector in which there are a large number of tall buildings will typically have a different coverage area shape than a sector in which there is mostly dense foliage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further, the shape of a sector can vary dynamically with environmental changes leading to areas where coverage is absent. These areas, called &ldquo;dead spots,&rdquo; are often caused by physical barriers such as hills, tunnels, and the like. In addition, the varying shape of a sector can reduce or eliminate the overlap between adjacent sectors and adjacent cells leading to dropped communications. Thus, it would be advantageous to more efficiently use wireless capacity by dynamically adjusting the shape of sectors in order to avoid dead spots and dropped communications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In addition, adding or moving base stations in a conventional wireless communication system requires considerable planning to determine the precise locations of each base station to ensure that the entire coverage area of the system is covered without dead spots or redundancy. Such planning typically includes the physical mapping of the coverage area. For example, one conventional method of mapping a coverage cell comprises placing a transceiver on a mobile unit such as an automobile and measuring the reception as the unit moves throughout the area. Because cell mapping can be costly and time consuming, it would be advantageous for base stations to dynamically map cells based on communications received from wireless devices. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, methods and systems are provided to address the above and other problems of the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Methods and systems consistent with the invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, comprise a method for adjusting coverage in a wireless communication system. In one embodiment of the present invention, measurements performed by at least one wireless device at a first cell having a first coverage area is received at the first cell. Upon receiving the measurement information, the first coverage area is determined based on the received measurement information. The first cell then transmits information about the first coverage area to a second cell having a second coverage area. Upon receipt, the second cell may then use the received first coverage area information to adjust the second coverage area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, such methods and systems comprise a method for mapping coverage in a wireless communication system. In accordance with the invention, a plurality of wireless devices is provided at a first cell having a first coverage area. The power of the first cell is monitored by the plurality of wireless devices and collected by the first cell. Based on the collected power information, the first coverage area is mapped. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed. Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate several embodiments of the invention and together with the description serve to explain the principles of the invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a block diagram of a wireless system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, in accordance with methods and systems consistent with the invention. As illustrated, one or more base stations <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are connected to a network <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which may include, for example, the Internet or any other type of network. The base stations <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be directly connected to network <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> or may be connected to network <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> through subnetworks (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As illustrated, each base station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is connected to an antenna <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> through which communication is established with wireless devices. Like present cellular systems, each base station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> communicates with wireless devices located in a particular cell where each cell covers a specific geographical area. The wireless devices (not shown) used to communicate in cellular wireless system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may include, for example, a standard wireless phone, a third generation cellular device, or any other type of wireless device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In cellular wireless system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the intelligence that in the prior system resided in the base transceiver systems (&ldquo;BTS&rdquo;), base station controllers (&ldquo;BSC&rdquo;), and mobile switching centers (&ldquo;MSC&rdquo;) may be distributed amongst the base stations <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> For example, each base station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may operate autonomously and include intelligence for exchanging information with other base stations for the purposes of adjusting the coverage areas for the base stations, handing off wireless devices from one base station to another, and, when the base station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is plugged into the network <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, automatically locating other base stations and configuring itself. Further, each base station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be configured using software programmable on a MultiPC platform. That is, the base stations <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may not need specific hardware, but rather, all of the base station&apos;s functionality may be performed in software using general purpose processors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Because there is no central MSC or BSC, the wireless system can be grown simply by adding base stations <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the wireless system. As such, this solution may be used for both very small and very large configurations. Also, the base stations <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may use advanced signal processing, such as space time adaptive processing (&ldquo;STAP&rdquo;), multi-user detection (&ldquo;MUD&rdquo;), and multi-user detection across cells (&ldquo;MUDAC&rdquo;). Further, the base stations <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may use sectored antennas that adapt their direction dynamically to improve network performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The base stations <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may also use standard internet protocols for communicating over the network <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. For example, the base stations may use Mobile IP, DHCP, VPN, etc. to communicate with each other. Also, the base stations may use standard air interfaces, such as, IS-95, cdma2000, UWC-136, W-CDMA, UMTS-3GPP-W-CDMA, etc. Further, because standard air interfaces may be used, no changes to existing cellular phones or networks are necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a block diagram of a base station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, in accordance with methods and systems consistent with the invention. As shown, the base station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a network interface <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, a processor <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, a memory <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, a storage device <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, an antenna interface <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, and a bus <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The network interface <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be, for example, an Ethernet type interface that the base station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may use to connect to the network <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be any type of processor for performing computer type operations. The memory <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be any type of memory, such as a Random Access Memory (RAM). The storage device <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may be any type of storage device, such as, a hard drive, a CD-ROM, etc. The antenna interface <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> connects the base station to an antenna for communicating with wireless devices. The antenna interface <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may include a radio transmitting and receiving device (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, each base station may be a plug and play type device. For example, when a base station <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> connects to a network such as network <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, it automatically identifies any other base stations <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also connected to the network. Then, the base stations <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> communicate with one another to automatically determine the coverage area for the new base station and the existing base stations in the network. Then, the base stations may communicate amongst themselves to accomplish various functions, such as handing off wireless devices from one base station to another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a wireless system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, in accordance with methods and systems consistent with the invention. As illustrated, base stations <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>_<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>_<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are connected to network <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>_<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is connected to a network <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> through gateway <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>_<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Network <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>_<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may include a Dynamic Host Control Protocol (&ldquo;DHCP&rdquo;) server <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and a Domain Name Server (&ldquo;DNS&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>372</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Base stations <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>_<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> _<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> _<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> are connected to a network <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>_<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which connects to network <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> through gateway <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>_<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A carrier database <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, which connects to network <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>_<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, stores information regarding the base stations in a carrier&apos;s network. For example, the carrier database <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> may store the IP address for each of the base stations in the carrier&apos;s network. A carrier refers to a company providing wireless services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Networks <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>_<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>_<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may include any type of network, such as, an Ethernet, a Fiber Distributed Date Interface (&ldquo;FDDI&rdquo;) network, etc. Network <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> may also include any type of network, such as the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The central database of wireless networks (&ldquo;CDWN&rdquo;) <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> stores information regarding the network addresses (e.g. IP addresses) for the carrier databases <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. For example, there may be multiple carriers providing wireless services, such as Bell Atlantic, Sprint, etc. In such an embodiment, the CDWN <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> may store the network address of the carrier database <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> for each carrier. Thus, if a base station needs to locate a carrier database <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> of a particular carrier, it can access the CDWN <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> to obtain the network address for the carrier database <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> With the above preface on the illustrative operating environment, the remaining FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which illustrate aspects of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, will be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates two exemplary base stations <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> connected by a network <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> in a wireless communications system operating in accordance with methods and systems consistent with the present invention. While the two exemplary base stations <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> are shown to be interconnected via packet network <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight>, any network with sufficiently high data speed and sufficiently low delay could be used to connect the base stations. As described above, in one embodiment of the present invention, the packet network <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> may include the global computer network commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Internet.&rdquo; The packet network <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> may use protocols well known to those skilled in the art, such as Mobile IP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Wireless devices typically have a limited range and communicate within respective coverage cells of a wireless communication system. Within such a system, a handoff occurs when a wireless device moves out of range of its existing base station contact within a given cell. Instead of allowing the call connection signal to deteriorate to noise level, the call connection is transferred or handed-over to another cell to maintain the communication with the roving wireless device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Base stations <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> are also shown serving a plurality of wireless devices, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight><highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, . . . , <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>, respectively. A handoff occurs when a wireless device moves out of range of its existing base station contact within a given cell. The wireless device is transferred or handed-over to another base station to maintain communications with the roving wireless device. In the well-known &ldquo;soft handoff&rdquo; method, a wireless device simultaneously communicates with two or more base stations as the wireless device moves between the coverage areas of the respective base stations. Soft handoff can be contrasted with &ldquo;hard handoff,&rdquo; where communications with the first base station are terminated before a link with the second base station is established. Maintaining at least one link at all times improves the reliability and quality of communications being conducted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The coverage areas of base stations <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> are shown as hexagonal cells <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight>, which serve to indicate an approximate boundary within which radio communications can be effected with their respective wireless devices <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>. Data is communicated between wireless devices operating within its radio coverage area and their respective base stations by transmitting and receiving radio signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Each base station <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> may include an antenna array comprising at least one antenna that is capable of simultaneously communicating with a plurality of wireless devices. Because each wireless device is individually located within a cell, a plurality of transmission paths exists between the antennas and the wireless devices. Each transmission path, in turn, has a corresponding path delay and signal strength relative to its receiving antenna. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Using their antenna arrays, base stations <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> may subdivide cells <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> into multiple sectors. For example, cells <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> are each divided into six sectors <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f, </italic></highlight>respectively. In the case of a typical six-sectored system, channel use is generally limited to a 60 degree radius about the cell site. It should be appreciated, however, that individual sectors <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> may be adjusted to have greater or lesser coverage areas about the cell site of disproportionate angles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Still referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, sectors <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> are shown to overlap with adjacent sectors. The overlapping sectors may provide soft-handoff capability, thus allowing a wireless device within the overlapping area to simultaneously communicate with two or more base stations. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, sector overlap may occur across cells or within a cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the wireless devices communicate with their respective base stations via their antennas in accordance with Wide-Band Code Division Multiple Access (&ldquo;W-CDMA&rdquo;).

While several embodiments of the present invention will be generally described in the context of a W-CDMA wireless communication system, the present invention is not limited to use in any particular communication scheme and may be utilized for any communication scheme or standard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> simplified version of a wireless system having two exemplary base stations dynamically adjusting sector shapes will be described in accordance with methods and systems of the present invention. For simplicity, only sectors <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are shown. However, the system described applies to all sectors within cells <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> as well as sectors from adjoining cells (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, wireless devices <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> perform downlink channel measurements on their serving base stations. For example, wireless device <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may perform signal strength measurements on the serving sector&apos;s pilot channel. In another embodiment of the invention, wireless device <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may perform signal strength-to-noise ratio measurements on the serving sector&apos;s pilot channel. Methods and systems for measuring signal strength are well known to those skilled in the art of wireless technology. Likewise, methods for measuring a signal-to-noise ratio are well known to those skilled in the art of wireless technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> These measurements are communicated to the respective serving base station by data messages sent from the wireless devices. In an embodiment of the invention, wireless devices may transmit measurement messages at periodic time intervals or when requested by their serving base station. In another embodiment, the serving base station may specify transmission of measurement information based on particular measurement reporting criteria. For example, measurement reporting criteria may specify periodic reporting, event triggered reporting such as when a communication is initiated, or a combination of both periodic and event triggered reporting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The format of the data messages may be defined by, for example, the W-CDMA standard. In the W-CDMA standard, communications between a base station and a wireless device are via a plurality of simultaneous, orthogonally-coded channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, on receipt of multiple measurements from the wireless devices, the respective base stations <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> evaluate the information to determine boundary estimates, or approximations of the effective coverage area, of each sector <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight>, particularly sectors <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>A method for determining boundary estimates will be further described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Upon determining a boundary estimate for sectors <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>base stations <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> transmit their respective estimate to each other via network <highlight><bold>480</bold></highlight> (as well as other base stations having sectors overlapping sectors <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(not shown)). On receipt of the respective boundary estimate, base stations <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> may then apply the estimate to determine whether any adjustments should be made to the shapes of sectors <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In other words, base station <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may apply its estimate of <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the estimate of <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>provided by base station <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> to determine whether any adjustments are necessary. In an embodiment of the invention, determining whether adjustments are necessary includes evaluating whether the soft-handoff areas, i.e., the overlapping areas between the sectors, meet a predetermined area based on the initial layout of the network. If so, the base stations then both adjust the shapes of their sectors to better approximate the desired soft-handoff area. In this embodiment, the shape of the sector may be adjusted by modifying the strength of the pilot channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> method for adjusting a sector will be described in accordance with methods and systems consistent with the present invention. In an embodiment, the initial layout of a wireless communication system, including the number and size of each cell and sector; the location, e.g., latitude and longitude, of each base station; as well as the desired sector overlap areas are determined. For example, this information may be determined during the planning stages of a wireless communication system based on required constraints such as cost and desired soft-handoff overlap area. Alternatively, this information may be determined using methods and systems in accordance with the illustrative operating environment. In addition, the respective pilot channel power strengths of each base station may be known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Using methods known to those skilled in the art, the locations of wireless devices may be determined by the angle and elevation of each wireless device via an adaptive array antenna with distance measured via chip timing. Moreover, sector boundaries may be defined using boundary signal strength thresholds based on the known pilot channel power strength. For example, one known method for estimating a cell&apos;s radius based on signal strength measurements can be found in IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology of November &apos;98, Bernardin, et al., which is incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a cell in which a sector is subdivided into sub-sectors <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in accordance with methods and systems consistent with the invention. In an embodiment of the invention, the sub-sectors <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are 20 percent the size of sector <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight> and sub-sector <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is 60 percent the size of sector <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the size of the sub-sectors may vary depending on the then-current size of the sector in order to maintain the 20-60-20 percent ratios. Each side boundary of a sector may be adjusted independently, with two adjacent sectors having a common predetermined initial boundary that may serve as a reference line for sector adjustment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Referring to the three sub-sectors <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the sector <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, linear regression may be used to estimate the sector radius separately for each of the three sub-sectors. For example, given a set of radius&mdash;power measurements from the wireless devices within each sub-sector (r<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, P<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>), performing linear regression on the following propagation model may be used to determine the approximate radius of each sub-division. </paragraph>

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Using the predetermined desired overlap area as the target, the two base stations may mutually grow or mutually reduce their respective overlapping sectors. For example, by increasing the strength of a sector&apos;s power, the effective coverage area is increased thereby increasing the overlap area. In one embodiment, the overlap area is grown by increasing the strength of the sector&apos;s power and reduced by decreasing the strength of the sector&apos;s power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the present invention, the amount of adjustment needed to reach the desired overlap area between overlapping sectors may be apportioned according to the ratio of the areas of the sectors involved (area of a sector&equals;the square of the radius times the sector angle divided by 2). The power adjustment for each sector may then be computed based on the sector&apos;s share of the area adjustment, again in proportion to the radius squared times the sector angle. Because the cell overlap area may be used to estimate the sector overlap area, the overlapping sector powers may be adjusted even though the comparison was based on the cell overlap area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the necessary power adjustment is applied only to the 60 percent sub-sector <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> For each 20 percent sub-sector <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the radius estimates of each sub-sector <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be compared to the predetermined nominal values. In one embodiment of the invention, the sub-sectors <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can have angular growth or reduction but cannot be reduced past the common boundary originally determined. In other words, the 20 percent sub-sectors may not be reduced so as to leave a gap in coverage between two adjacent sectors within the same cell. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the boundaries of sub-sectors <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be increased or reduced (if possible) by 1% of the then-current sector angle, to grow or reduce the sector radius toward its predetermined value. The sector angle may be increased or reduced using software controlling the antenna power configuration. Power may be proportionately adjusted to the change in area. Moreover, if there is a need to reduce the sector past the common boundary, an alarm may be posted to a base station operations channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a flow diagram of the steps performed for dynamically adjusting sectors across cells in accordance with methods and systems consistent with the present invention. While this method describes a simple example involving only two sectors, it should be obvious to one skilled in the art that the present invention can be easily extended to any number of sectors within any number of cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 8</cross-reference>, wireless devices <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> may perform downlink channel measurements on their respective serving base station <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> (Step <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>). After performing the measurements, the wireless devices may transmit the measurement information to its respective serving base station <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> (Step <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving measurements from the wireless devices <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> (Step <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>), each serving base station <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> determines whether sufficient measurements have been collected to estimate the boundary of each sector (Step <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>). In order to offset inaccuracies that may appear with horizontal antenna arrays, an inverse filter may be used to remove anisotropic weighting prior to performing any estimates. In one embodiment of the present invention, approximately <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight> measurements may be required before a base station estimates its boundary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> If, at step <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>, either base station <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> determines that insufficient measurements have been received, the base station(s) waits to receive additional measurements (Step <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>). The present method may be continuously performed. Accordingly, once a threshold number of measurements are received, e.g., <highlight><bold>2000</bold></highlight>, the present method may be repeated whenever a new measurement is received. Alternatively, boundary estimates may vary in time based on a base station&apos;s communication load. For example, base station <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may determine that during busy periods, estimating boundaries and adjusting sectors is not practical due to the unavailability of processing power. Consequently, during such times sector adjustments may not be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> If on the other hand, at step <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>, the base stations <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> determine that sufficient measurements have been received, the base stations estimate the boundaries of its respective sectors using, for example, the propagation model, P&equals;A&prime;&minus;Bs as described above (Step <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>). In an embodiment, the sector is divided into three sub-sectors. After performing estimation(s) for their respective sectors <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the base stations <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> transmit the estimate(s) to the appropriate neighboring base stations, in this case, each other (Step <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>). Using the received estimate(s), each respective base station <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> then calculates the nominal cell edge region radii and overlap areas (Step <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>). In one embodiment, the calculation may be done by only one of the base stations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Based on the overlap areas and/or cell edge parameters, base stations <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> then determine whether sectors <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>should be grown or reduced (Step <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>). If not, the base station waits to receive additional measurements (Step <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>). If so, the base station determines whether the adjustments can be accomplished within the predetermined constraints (Step <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> If, at step <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>, the sectors can be adjusted within the constraints, then the base stations <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> each adjust their respective sectors (Step <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight>) and the method returns to step <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> to await additional measurements. On the other hand, if sectors <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>472</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>cannot be adjusted within the constraints, then the event is logged for later review (Step <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> While it has been illustrated and described what is at present considered to be the preferred embodiments and methods of the present invention, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made, and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the true scope of the invention. Moreover, it should be appreciated that the present invention may be used for many different applications, such as automatic configuration when a new base station is added to a wireless communication system. Therefore it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiments and methods disclosed herein, but the invention includes all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
