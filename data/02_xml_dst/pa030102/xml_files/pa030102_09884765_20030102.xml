<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a system and a method for estimating storage capacity of an exhaust gas aftertreatment device, and more particularly, to estimating an oxidant storage capacity of a Lean NOx Trap coupled downstream of an internal combustion engine. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Internal combustion engines are typically coupled to an emission control device known as a three-way catalytic converter (TWC) designed to reduce combustion by-products such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Engines can operate at air-fuel mixture ratios lean of stoichiometry, thus improving fuel economy. For lean engine operation, an additional three-way catalyst commonly referred to as a Lean NOx Trap (LNT), is usually coupled downstream of an upstream three-way catalyst. The LNT stores exhaust components such as, for example, NOx and oxygen, when the engine is operating at a lean air-fuel ratio, and releases and reduces (purges) them when the engine is operating at a rich or stoichiometric air-fuel ratio. Over time, the ability of the LNT to store exhaust components can decrease due to factors such as sulfur deposits (SOx) from the fuel. Therefore, when the LNT efficiency is sufficiently reduced, a SOx purge has to be performed. Typically, the catalyst is heated and engine air-fuel ratio is changed to rich for SOx release and reduction. Since SOx purges result in fuel economy penalties, it is desirable not to purge unnecessarily. Thus, in order to maintain adherence to emission standards and obtain fuel economy benefits of a lean burning engine, it is desirable to monitor the efficiency of the LNT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One method of determining the efficiency of the LNT is by correlating it to the oxidant storage capability, as described in US 5,713,199. The amount of stored oxidant is calculated from a quantity of fuel required to purge it from the LNT wherein the purge is performed during high load operating conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The inventors herein have recognized a disadvantage with this approach. Namely, when estimates of this method are performed under high load operating conditions, i.e., at high space velocity, the amount of time that the reductant used to purge stored oxidants is present in the LNT is reduced. Therefore, not all of the oxidants are purged during high-speed engine operation, resulting in an inaccurate estimate of the total LNT storage capacity. In other words, the reductant does not have sufficient time to react with stored oxidants when the LNT purge is performed under high load conditions. This will cause inaccurate capacity estimates and reductant wastage. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In solving the above problem, a system and a method are provided for monitoring efficiency of an exhaust gas aftertreatment device by correlating it to the device&apos;s capacity to store an exhaust component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In carrying out the above solution, features and advantages of the present invention, a system and a method for monitoring an efficiency of an exhaust gas aftertreatment device disposed in an exhaust passage of a lean burn internal combustion engine, include providing an indication that the engine is operating at low space velocity; and in response to said indication, estimating an amount of an exhaust component stored in the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a number of advantages. For example, it allows for much more accurate estimate of oxidant storage capacity, since at idle or low load operation the reductant injected into the device has more time to react with the stored oxidants than during high speed operation. Therefore, all of the oxidants stored will be released, and wastage of reductant will be eliminated. Thus, due to increased accuracy of oxidant storage estimation, the efficiency of the LNT can be determined with more precision and less reductant wastage. This in turn will prevent unnecessary purges allowing for more lean running time, and increase fuel economy. Also, improved emission control can be achieved due to improved accuracy. An advantage of the present invention is that </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The above advantages and other advantages, objects and features of the present invention will be readily apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the present invention is independent of the particular underlying engine technology and configuration. As such, the present invention may be used in a variety of types of internal combustion engines, such a s conventional engines in addition to direct injection stratified charge (DISC) or direct injection spark ignition engines (DISI). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A block diagram illustrating an engine control system and method for a representative internal combustion engine according to the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Preferably, such an engine includes a plurality of combustion chambers only one of which is shown, and is controlled by electronic engine controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Combustion chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes combustion chamber walls <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> positioned therein and connected to crankshaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In this particular example, the piston <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a recess or bowl (not shown) for forming stratified charges of air and fuel. In addition, the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is shown communicating with intake manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and exhaust manifold <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> via respective intake valves <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(not shown), and exhaust valves <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(not shown). A fuel injector <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is shown directly coupled to combustion chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for delivering liquid fuel directly therein in proportion to the pulse width of signal fpw received from controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via conventional electronic driver <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Fuel is delivered to the fuel injector <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> by a conventional high-pressure fuel system (not shown) including a fuel tank, fuel pumps, and a fuel rail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Intake manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is shown communicating with throttle body <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> via throttle plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. In this particular example, the throttle plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is coupled to electric motor <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> such that the position of the throttle plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is controlled by controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via electric motor <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. This configuration is commonly referred to as electronic throttle control, (ETC), which is also utilized during idle speed control. In an alternative embodiment (not shown), which is well known to those skilled in the art, a bypass air passageway is arranged in parallel with throttle plate <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to control inducted airflow during idle speed control via a throttle control valve positioned within the air passageway. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Exhaust gas sensor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is shown coupled to exhaust manifold <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> upstream of catalytic converter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In this particular example, sensor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is a universal exhaust gas oxygen (UEGO) sensor, also known as a proportional oxygen sensor. The UEGO sensor generates a signal whose magnitude is proportional to the oxygen level (and the air-fuel ratio) in the exhaust gases. This signal is provided to controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which converts it into a relative air-fuel ratio. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, signal UEGO is used during feedback air-fuel ratio control in to maintain average air-fuel ratio at a desired air-fuel ratio as described later herein. In an alternative embodiment, sensor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can provide signal EGO, exhaust gas oxygen (not shown), which indicates whether exhaust air-fuel ratio is lean or rich of stoichiometry. In another alternate embodiment, the sensor <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may comprise one of a carbon monoxide (CO) sensor, a hydrocarbon (HC) sensor, and a NOx sensor that generates a signal whose magnitude is related to the level of CO, HC, NOx, respectively, in the exhaust gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will recognize that any of the above exhaust gas sensors may be viewed as an air-fuel ratio sensor that generates a signal whose magnitude is indicative of the air-fuel ratio measured in exhaust gases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Conventional distributorless ignition system <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> provides ignition spark to combustion chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via spark plug <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> in response to spark advance signal SA from controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> causes combustion chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to operate in either a homogeneous air-fuel ratio mode or a stratified air-fuel ratio mode by controlling injection timing. In the stratified mode, controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> activates fuel injector <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> during the engine compression stroke so that fuel is sprayed directly into the bowl of piston <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Stratified air-fuel layers are thereby formed. The stratum closest to the spark plug contains a stoichiometric mixture or a mixture slightly rich of stoichiometry, and subsequent strata contain progressively leaner mixtures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the homogeneous mode, controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> activates fuel injector <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> during the intake stroke so that a substantially homogeneous air-fuel mixture is formed when ignition power is supplied to spark plug <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> by ignition system <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> controls the amount of fuel delivered by fuel injector <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> so that the homogeneous air-fuel ratio mixture in chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be selected to be substantially at (or near) stoichiometry, a value rich of stoichiometry, or a value lean of stoichiometry. Operation substantially at (or near) stoichiometry refers to conventional closed loop oscillatory control about stoichiometry. The stratified air-fuel ratio mixture will always be at a value lean of stoichiometry, the exact air-fuel ratio being a function of the amount of fuel delivered to combustion chamber <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. An additional split mode of operation wherein additional fuel is injected during the exhaust stroke while operating in the stratified mode is available. An additional split mode of operation wherein additional fuel is injected during the intake stroke while operating in the stratified mode is also available, where a combined homogeneous and split mode is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Lean NOx trap <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is shown positioned downstream of catalytic converter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Both devices store exhaust gas components, such as NOx and oxidants, when engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating lean of stoichiometry. The stored NOx and oxidants are subsequently reacted with HC and other reductant and are catalyzed during a purge cycle when controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> causes engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to operate in either a rich mode or a near stoichiometric mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Exhaust gas oxygen sensor <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is shown coupled to exhaust manifold <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> between the catalytic converter <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the NOx trap <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In this particular example, sensor <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> provides signal HEGO to controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and essentially serves as a switch providing information as to whether the air-fuel mixture is lean or rich at the mid-bed location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as a conventional microcomputer including but not limited to: microprocessor unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, input/output ports <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, an electronic storage medium for executable programs and calibration values, shown as read-only memory chip <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in this particular example, random access memory <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, keep alive memory <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and a conventional data bus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown receiving various signals from sensors coupled to engine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in addition to those signals previously discussed, including: measurement of inducted mass air flow (MAF) from mass air flow sensor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> coupled to throttle body <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>; engine coolant temperature (ECT) from temperature sensor <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> coupled to cooling sleeve <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>; a profile ignition pickup signal (PIP) from Hall effect sensor <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> coupled to crankshaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> giving an indication of engine speed (RPM); throttle position TP from throttle position sensor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>; and absolute Manifold Pressure Signal MAP from sensor <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Engine speed signal RPM is generated by controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from signal PIP in a conventional manner and manifold pressure signal MAP provides an indication of engine load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Fuel system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is coupled to intake manifold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> via tube <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Fuel vapors (not shown) generated in fuel system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> pass through tube <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and are controlled via purge valve <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Purge valve <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> receives control signal PRG from controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Exhaust sensor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is a NOx/UEGO sensor located downstream of the LNT. It produces two output signals. First output signal (SIGNAL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and second output signal (SIGNAL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) are both received by controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Exhaust sensor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be a sensor known to those skilled in the art that is capable of indicating both exhaust air-fuel ratio and nitrogen oxide concentration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, SIGNAL<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> indicates exhaust air-fuel ratio and SIGNAL<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> indicates nitrogen oxide concentration. In this embodiment, sensor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> has a first chamber (not shown) in which exhaust gas first enters where a measurement of oxygen partial pressure is generated from a first pumping current. Also, in the first chamber, oxygen partial pressure of the exhaust gas is controlled to a predetermined level. Exhaust air-fuel ratio can then be indicated based on this first pumping current. Next, the exhaust gas enters a second chamber (not shown) where NOx is decomposed and measured by a second pumping current using the predetermined level. Nitrogen oxide concentration can then be indicated based on this second pumping current. In an alternative embodiment, a separate NOx sensor could be used in conjunction with an air-fuel sensor, which could be a UEGO or a HEGO sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> generally represents operation of one embodiment of a system or method according to the present invention. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the diagram may represent one or more of any number of processing strategies such as event-driven, interrupt-driven, multi-tasking, multi-threading, and the like. As such, various steps or functions illustrated may be performed in the sequence illustrated, I parallel, or in some cases omitted. Likewise, the order of processing is not necessarily required to achieve the objects, features and advantages of the invention, but is provided for ease of illustration and description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Although not explicitly illustrated, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that one or more of the illustrated steps or functions may be repeatedly performed depending on the particular strategy being used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, first, in a decision block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> a determination is made whether the engine is operating at idle or low load conditions. If the answer is NO, the routing cycles through step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, until the engine is at idle or low load conditions. Once the answer to decision block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is YES, the routine proceeds to step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> wherein engine operation is switched to rich in order to purge stored exhaust gas components from the LNT. The purge is followed by lean operation in order to saturate the exhaust system with oxidants. Preferably, the engine is operated at its lean-limit so as to saturate the exhaust system as fast as possible. Next, in step <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> the output signal of the tailpipe UEGO sensor is compared to the output signal of the UEGO sensor upstream of the TWC. Once the two signals are within a predetermined constant of each other, i.e., close in value, meaning that the LNT is saturated with oxidants, then the answer to step <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is YES and the routine proceeds to step <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the routine continues cycling through step <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Next, in step <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, the engine operation is switched to rich in order to purge the stored oxidants. The routine then proceeds to step <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> wherein a determination is made whether the HEGO sensor <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> has switched to reading rich, i.e., none of the purge fuel is being used to purge oxidants from the TWC. Once the answer to step <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is YES, the routine proceeds to step <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> wherein the total amount of purge fuel, FG_FUEL_SUM, is calculated according to the following equation:

<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> wherein t is the time it takes for the UEGO sensor to start reading stoic or lean after the end of the LNT NOx purge. The routine then proceeds to step <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight> wherein the net fuel used to purge the LNT of stored oxidants, OX_PG_FUEL, is calculated according to the following equation:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>OX_PG_FUEL&equals;FG_FUEL_SUM&minus;(TP_FUEL_SUM<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> &plus;TP_FUEL_SUM <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In other words, the total fuel required to purge the LNT of stored oxidants is the difference between the purge fuel entering the trap and the purge fuel exiting the trap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> If the answer to step <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> is YES, i.e., no additional purge fuel is exiting the LNT, the routine proceeds directly to step <highlight><bold>1200</bold></highlight>. Next, in step <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>, the amount of oxidants stored in the LNT is calculated as follows:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>LNT_OX_CAP&equals;OX_PG_FUEL&middot;FUEL_TO_OX_FACTOR</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> wherein the conversion factor FUEL_TO_OX_FACTOR, is the amount of oxidant per gram of purge fuel. The routine then exits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Therefore, according to the present invention, a more precise measure of the LNT efficiency can be obtained by calculating the amount of fuel required to perform a purge after the trap has been saturated with oxidants while the space velocity is low, i.e., during low speed or idle engine operation. The measure of oxidant storage can then be used to schedule sulfur purge events when necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> This concludes the description of the invention. The reading of it by those skilled in the art would bring to mind many alterations and modifications without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention.
