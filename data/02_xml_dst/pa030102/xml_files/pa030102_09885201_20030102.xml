<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention generally relates to the field of computer based search systems, and more particularly relates to a system and method for visually searching knowledge bases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Knowledge repositories are collections of information in computer system for capturing expertise in some strategic area. Their purpose is to retain and disseminate expert information to a user, such as within a corporation. An example of a knowledge repository in a computer software consulting company would be a set of documents describing what strategies have been used effectively in the past to win business away from each of the company&apos;s chief competitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The elements of the knowledge repository under consideration here are in electronic form and available for distribution. The size of the repository could outnumber several million separate pieces of information. Typically, the vastness of the knowledge repository causes users to rely primarily on search engines to retrieve information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A typical search engine possesses a user interface with a search window where the user enters an alphanumeric search expression or keywords. The search engine sifts through a database of information for the user&apos;s search terms, and returns the search results in the form of HTML pages. Each search result includes a list of individual entries that have been identified by the search engine as satisfying the user&apos;s search expression. Each entry or &ldquo;hit&rdquo; includes a hyperlink that points to a location within the database. In addition to the hyperlink, certain search engine result pages include a summary or abstract that describes the content of the document. Other information may also be returned as part of a search result in response to a user&apos;s request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although search engines have made tremendous strides at improvement in recent years, the user interface can still be very complicated to use. Primarily, these interfaces place too many burdens on the inexperienced user to know which words to enter to retrieve only the best documents. As a further complication, the form of the result pages may not adequately indicate which documents truly contain the most relevant information for the user. Then, the user is forced to manually sort through a long list of results to try and determine what is most important to him. Additionally, for complex searches, users may even be called upon to employ Boolean operators, all of which serve to further confuse users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore a need exists to overcome the problems with the prior art as discussed above, and particularly for a user interface that visually displays corresponding search results and guides the user in exploring a knowledge repository. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a computing system and method provides a visual display for exploring a knowledge repository. This preferred method assumes that a knowledge expert has created a set of multiple partitionings of the knowledge repository according to the content of the knowledge elements, as well as a separate dictionary of terms for each partitioning. The method comprises the steps of accepting a natural language query, calculating the distance between the query string and a plurality of categories in partitions of a knowledge repository; and displaying, via a radial graph, at least one category that comprises a nearest distance to the query. Further, in response to the user selecting a category, the method visually displays all matching elements in that category along with its nearest neighbor categories in a scatter plot. This preferred method advantageously guides the user to better refine search queries.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The present invention, according to a preferred embodiment, overcomes problems with the prior art by guiding the user through a visual representation of all elements contained within a knowledge repository. The user may have little expertise in the area of interest to him. The user begins the search by entering a keyword or words of interest. For example, assuming the user was interested in wireless paging applications, the user would enter the word &ldquo;wireless&rdquo;. The program could then initiate a search, in a previously partitioned database located either locally to the computer system, on a server located within the company Intranet, or even a remote Internet site. The elements may be categorized in a multitude of manners, such as by subject, country of origin, author, etc . . . much as a card catalog in a library system. Each category constitutes a partitioning, and each partitioning contains its own unique dictionary of terms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As a result of this search, the user would be presented with a visual representation of the most relevant categories, and conceptual alternatives, in the database, in which the word &ldquo;wireless&rdquo; appears. The user then provides additional information, gradually, to winnow down the number of possible matching elements. Finally, the invention highlights specific areas of retrieved elements, which would be of greatest relevance to the user&apos;s previous input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> A significant aspect of the preferred embodiment is the approach of overlaying concept maps on top of a knowledge set, helping the user to understand the knowledge space and better refine his queries. The program then retrieves not simply element titles, but also the most relevant phrases within the most relevant elements. Such focused retrieval is important to prevent &ldquo;knowledge retrieval overload&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> illustrate an exemplary visual search system according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The visual search system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a computer system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, having a visual search application <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Computer system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be communicatively coupled with a database system <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, via a local area network interface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The local area network interface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be a wired communication link or a wireless communication link. Additionally, computer system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may also be communicatively coupled with a wide area network <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> such as the Internet, a wired, wireless, or combination of wired and wireless communication links via a wide area network communication link <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Computer system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes controller/processor <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) which processes instructions, performs calculations, and manages the flow of information through the computer system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Additionally, controller/processor <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is communicatively coupled with program memory <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Included within program memory <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> are a visual search application <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> (which will be discussed in later in greater detail), operating system platform <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, and glue software <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. The operating system platform <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> manages resources, such as the data stored in data memory <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, the scheduling of tasks, and processes the operation of the visual search application <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> in the program memory <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The operating system platform <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> also manages a graphical display interface (not shown), a user input interface (not shown) that receives inputs from the keyboard <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and the mouse <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, and communication network interfaces (not shown) for communicating with the network links <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> respectively. Additionally, the operating system platform <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> also manages many other basic tasks of the computer system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in a manner well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Glue software <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> may include drivers, stacks, and low level application programming interfaces (API&apos;s) and provides basic functional components for use by the operating system platform <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and by compatible applications that run on the operating system platform <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> for managing communications with resources and processes in the computing system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Network interfaces (not shown) communicatively couple the visual search application <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> in the computer system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with a look-up system <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The look-up system <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, according to one alternative embodiment, comprises a knowledge database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>; a classification record <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, communicatively coupled to the knowledge database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>; a dictionary space <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> communicatively coupled to the knowledge database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and to the classification record <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>; a centroid record <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, communicatively coupled to the knowledge database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the classification record <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and the dictionary space <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>; and a vector space <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> communicatively coupled to the knowledge database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the classification record <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the centroid record <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, and the dictionary space <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Note that as shown the database server system <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is shown on a local area network. According to a second embodiment, a look-up system may comprise a remote search server system (not shown). Alternatively, the look-up system <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be located in the computer system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> resident in program memory <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and managing data in a database memory (not shown) as part of the data memory <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The knowledge database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> comprises multiple partitionings, defined according to different aspects of their content. There are many well-known methods for partitioning knowledge databases based on content in an automated fashion. One possibility is that a series of keyword queries (one for each category of the partition) may be fashioned and used to identify which elements belong in each category. Another possibility is to use text-clustering techniques to create a set of element clusters. A third possibility is to use a combination of these two techniques combined with manual intervention by a human expert, as taught by U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/429650, &ldquo;System and Method for Interactive Classification and Analysis of Data&rdquo; filed on Oct. 29, 1999, the entire teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference, to determine, on a case by case basis, which elements fall into which category. The classification record <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> contains a listing of which elements are contained in which partitioning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The dictionary space <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> comprises a set of separate dictionaries of terms; one dictionary for each partitioning of the knowledge database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. These dictionaries may be created by first finding the most frequently occurring words in the knowledge database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, then pruning out those words that have little or no relevance for purposes of the classification. Automated counting methods, as taught by U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/629831, &ldquo;Method for Generation of an N-Word Phrase Dictionary from a Text&rdquo; filed on Jul. 31, 2000, the entire teachings of which collectively are hereby incorporated by reference, can help determine word relevance by counting co-occurrence of dictionary terms and classes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The vector space <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> comprises a set of records, one for each partitioning, which contain a &ldquo;vector&rdquo; of equal length to the size of that partitioning&apos;s corresponding dictionary. All elements within a partitioning are mapped to each term within that dictionary; with non-zero values equal to the number of times each dictionary term occurs in the knowledge element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The centroid record <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> contains a listing of the average word occurrence of each term in each partitioning of the knowledge database <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the exemplary visual search application <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The visual user interface/event manager <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is structured to receive all visual user interface/event manager <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> events, such as mouse movements, keyboard inputs, drag and drop actions, user selections, and updates to the display <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Visual user interface/event manager <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is also structured to receive match records, from the result set manager <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, which will be discussed subsequently, representing the result set <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> for a user initiated search request. These results are then displayed to the user via the display <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The visual user interface/event manager <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> is communicatively coupled with query handler <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, application programming interface <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, and result set manager <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> After the user has requested a keyword search, the query handler <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is invoked from the visual user interface/event manager <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> to initiate the user&apos;s search request. Input to the query handler <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> can preferably be a text based search query. The preferably text based search query is parsed to determine which dictionary terms occur within it, then sent to the Application Programming Interface <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> (API) designated for communication with the look-up system <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, and then to the look-up system <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> which has been discussed previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The vector calculator <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> then evaluates the relative nearness between the query string vector and each category centroid of each partition, then sends the result set <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> to the result set manager <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The M nearest categories are sent to the visual user interface/event manager <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> for displaying to the screen <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is an exemplary visual user interface illustrating a radial graph representation <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> of a search query response according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The radial graph representation <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> comprises a keyword hub <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>; a set of weighted spokes <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, radially coupled to the keyword hub <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>; and a set of related concept boxes <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, each related concept box <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> being coupled to opposite end of one weighted spoke <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. The related concept box <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> comprising a top portion <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> and a bottom portion <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, the top portion <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> containing the partition name and the bottom portion <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> containing the category name. The relevance of each concept box <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> is indicated by the appearance of the weighted spoke <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> coupling the concept box <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> to the keyword hub <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. For example, a yellow line <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> (indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> as a double line) would indicate a greater relative similarity to the query than a black line <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. Thick spoke lines <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, followed by thin <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight>, followed by dotted lines <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> indicate decreasing similarity within a color. In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the query &ldquo;wireless&rdquo; is most nearly related to the categories &ldquo;Broadband&rdquo; <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> and &ldquo;Voice Recognition Technology&rdquo; <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> within the partitioning &ldquo;Buzzwords&rdquo; <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is an exemplary visual user interface illustrating a scatter plot representation <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> of a search query response according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The knowledge elements of a selected category, along with its nearest neighbor categories, are displayed as points <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> in a scatter plot fashion. Text from a corresponding element is displayed in a pop-up window <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> in response to the user moving a mouse <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> over a point <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> in the plot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is an operational flow diagram illustrating an exemplary operational sequence for the system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The system enters the sequence at step <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, wherein a user is communicating via a user interface <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> with the computer system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The user operates the user interface, such as the mouse <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> or keyboard <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> to enter a search query string. A query handler <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> parses the query string, at step <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, and the vector calculator <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> evaluates the relative nearness between the query string and the categories of each partition. A numeric &ldquo;nearness&rdquo; value for the query string to all categories in all partitionings is calculated by finding the average word occurrence (centroid) within a partition of elements and comparing this to the query string vector using the cosine distance metric to determine the distance (d) between vector (X) and vector (Y):

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The M nearest categories are selected for display to the user as a radial graph <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The user then provides additional information, at step <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, by &ldquo;clicking&rdquo; on the concept box <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> of interest. This additional information helps to narrow the search further, without the user needing to provide additional search terms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the invention then presents the matching elements and nearest neighbor categories, at step <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, in a visual display <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The neighboring categories are chosen by measuring the relative distance of the mean of the selected class to the mean of every other class using the distance metric described above. Each point in the plot represents a knowledge element and its relative position in the dictionary space. The high dimensional dictionary space is reduced to two dimensions by use of a visualization mechanism described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,100,901, &ldquo;Method and Apparatus for Cluster Exploration and Visualization&rdquo;, filed Jun. 22, 1998, the entire teachings of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Alternatively, the search results could be presented as a list of elements with a corresponding distance calculation displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment could also calculate the terms within the selected partitioning that have the highest occurrence correlation with the query. The user, at step <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight>, could then choose to add these suggested terms to the search query string and begin a new search. This further refines the search request to more suit the user&apos;s needs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The user, at step <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, then moves his mouse over points in the plot. Text from the corresponding knowledge element is displayed, at step <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, in a pop-up window <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. The text is found by searching the original knowledge element until the first occurrence of a user query term is found. This term, plus the next N characters are included in the display string, adding enough characters to insure that the last word is not truncated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Then, at step <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>, the user clicks on a point <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight> in the visualization to select a knowledge element. The entire text of the original knowledge element is displayed, at step <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight>, with the query words highlighted. The user may repeat steps <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> at any time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The present invention can be realized in hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software. A system according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention can be realized in a centralized fashion in one computer system, or in a distributed fashion where different elements are spread across several interconnected computer systems. Any kind of computer system&mdash;or other apparatus adapted for carrying out the methods described herein&mdash;is suited. A typical combination of hardware and software could be a general purpose computer system with a computer program that, when being loaded and executed, controls the computer system such that it carries out the methods described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The present invention can also be embedded in a computer program product, which comprises all the features enabling the implementation of the methods described herein, and which&mdash;when loaded in a computer system&mdash;is able to carry out these methods. Computer program means or computer program in the present context mean any expression, in any language, code or notation, of a set of instructions intended to cause a system having an information processing capability to perform a particular function either directly or after either or both of the following a) conversion to another language, code or, notation; and b) reproduction in a different material form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Each computer system may include, inter alia, one or more computers and at least a computer readable medium allowing a computer to read data, instructions, messages or message packets, and other computer readable information from the computer readable medium. The computer readable medium may include non-volatile memory, such as ROM, Flash memory, Disk drive memory, CD-ROM, and other permanent storage.
