<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the prevention and treatment of health conditions caused by constriction of smooth muscle cells in organs of the human body. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The cause of many diseases remains unknown. Among these diseases with unknown origin are most common diseases including high blood pressure, asthma, glaucoma and tinnitus. In case of high blood pressure, one of the most renowned textbooks in medicine, Harrison&apos;s Principles of Internal Medicine, states that the cause of the disease is unknown in about 90% of the patients. Worldwide several hundred million people suffer from these health conditions and the economic damage to society from not being able to treat these health conditions effectively is immeasurable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Worldwide several million people suffer from asthma bronchiale (asthma). In its late stages asthma is a debilitating disease leading to the inability to work and to-social isolation. The cause of this disease remains unknown, even though allergens, genetic disposition and psychological factors have been implicated. The common pathomechanism of this disease is an obstruction of the ventilation channels in the lung (bronchioles) and of the passages to the alveoli where the oxygenation takes place. However, the cellular mechanisms that trigger this obstruction, thereby causing asthma, is not yet understood. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Tinnitus is a form of hearing impairment that in most cases occurs suddenly and without any warning signs. It is estimated that worldwide more than one million patients suffer from tinnitus and related hearing impairment. The origin and the pathogenesis of this disease are unknown and currently there exists no effective therapy to improve the hearing capacity of tinnitus patients. Consequently, many of these patients suffer for years and decades from impaired hearing often with detrimental consequences for the ability to work and their social life. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is assumed that a variety of apparently different health conditions occurring in different organs is caused by biochemical dysfunction of the same type of cells, called smooth muscle cells. This type of muscle cell is not susceptible to conscious control as opposed for example to the muscles of the arms or legs. Proper metabolic function of smooth muscle cells would, therefore, be a key to avoiding health problems in all those organs where smooth muscle cells play a critical functional role. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In case of asthma it is assumed that the common cellular mechanism could be found. The walls of bronchioles and alveoli channels contain a layer of smooth muscle cells, If these cells would constrict&mdash;irrespective of the trigger&mdash;the diameter of these lung ducts would decrease, leading to a decrease in ventilation and oxygenation. Thus, the typical symptoms of a patient with asthma and/or obstructive lung disease would occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In case of tinnitus and hearing impairment it is conceivable that the hearing impairment is caused by spasm of smooth muscle cells which form the lining of blood vessels responsible for blood supply to the inner ear and to the nerve cells mediating acoustic signals. It was further assumed that the spasm of these smooth muscle cells in the ear capillaries is caused by a lack of co-enzymes and other bioenergy molecules essential for optimum metabolic function of these cells. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There was not found any earlier description of this concept in the scientific literature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Recent progress has been made in understanding the metabolism of cells and the role of certain biochemical compounds in maintaining their proper function. Consequently, correcting the dysfunction of smooth muscle cell metabolism would be a key to preventing and treating a variety of health conditions in different organs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It was further found that the cellular dysfunction could be caused by a deficiency of certain biochemical compounds needed as co-enzymes in the tricarbon acid-cycle, the so-called Krebs-cycle, the respiration chain and for other metabolic functions in smooth muscle cells. The health conditions that can potentially be prevented and treated include, but are not limited thereto, the following organs and diseases: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Blood vessels, lungs, eye, uro-genital tract, gastro-intestinal tract </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> High blood pressure, angina pectoris, tinnitus, impotence, asthma and other forms of obstructive lung diseases, glaucoma and other forms of increased eye pressure, pre-menstrual syndrome, infertility, spasms of the ureter, urethra, singultus, stomach cramps, and spasms of the gall duct. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of this invention to administer a composition of biochemical substances to a patient suffering from health conditions as mentioned above but not limited thereto which comprises compounds of various vitamins, various amino acids and various trace elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of this invention to administer to a patient compositions of biochemical substances consisting of at least one ascorbate compound selected from the group consisting of ascorbic acid, pharmaceutically acceptable ascorbate salts and/or mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is another object of this invention to administer a composition of biochemical substances to a patient consisting of one ascorbate compound with at least one arginine compound selected from the group of arginine hydrochlorides, pharmaceutically acceptable arginine salts and/or mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of this invention to administer to a patient a composition of biochemical substances consisting of ascorbate compounds, arginine compounds and at least one magnesium compound selected from magnesium or pharmaceutically acceptable magnesium salts and/or mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of this invention to administer to a patient the therapeutical composition of biochemical substances like Ascorbic Acid, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Beta-, Gamma-, Delta-Tocopherol-Mix, Beta-Carotene, Biotin, Calcium Ascorbate, Calcium Citrate, Calcium Glycinate, Carotinoid-Mix: (Alpha-Carot., Lutein. Zea-, Kryptoxanthin), Cholecalciferol, Chromium Glycinate, Citrus Bioflavonoids, Coenzyme Q10, Copper Glycinate, Cyanocobalamin, d-Alpha-Tocopherol, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Di-calcium Phosphate, Folic Acid, Inositol, L-Arginine, L-Carnitine, L-Cysteine, L-Lysine, L-Proline, L-Selenomethionine, Magnesium Ascorbate, Magnesium Citrate, Magnesim Glycinate, Manganese Chelate, Molybdenum Glycinate, Niacin, Niacinamid, Potassium Chelate, Pycnogenol, Pyrodoxine, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Zinc Glycinate. It is understood that a skill in the art would readily determine the dosage of these added components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of this invention to administer to a patient a composition of biochemical substances whereas these formulas are provided to a patient in form of tablets, pills, injections, infusions, inhalations, suppositories or other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or means of delivery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> This concept was clinically tested for several of the above-mentioned health conditions, i.e. high blood pressure, asthma and tinnitus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The treatment with such compositions of biochemical substances leads to at least partly considerable relaxations of smooth muscle cells resulting in the increase of artery diameter of large arteries (e.g. aorta) lowering elevated blood pressure, increasing artery diameter of midsize arteries (e.g. coronary arteries) resulting in a decrease of angina pectoris, resulting in the increase of diameter of arterioles and capillaries (e.g. arteries of the ear) leading to improved hearing, relaxation of smooth muscle cells in lung bronchioles and alveoli leading to an increase of airway diameter following a decrease of asthma symptoms, the relaxation of canal systems of the eye resulting in an increase of diameter e.g. of tear ducts decreasing eye pressure leading to a decreased risk of glaucoma and blindness, the relaxation of smooth muscle cells in ovarian tubes and uterus resulting in relaxation of muscle tissue improving fertility and decreasing PMS symptoms, relaxation of smooth muscle cells in gall ducts, ureter and urethra increasing the diameter of ducts resulting in a decreased risk of cramps caused by gall stones or kidney stones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Having disclosed a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the following examples are provided by way of illustration only and are not limiting the invention in any way.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> However, a composition of biochemical substances according to the above example may be varied with individual components, others than of the formula used and irrespective of their amounts which are more than 80% identical with such substances. Further the amounts of individual ingredients provided per day may be not less than 10% and not more than 1000% of the amounts as shown in the example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The concept of this invention was tested in a prospective clinical study with eight asthma patients. These patients received the biochemical compounds listed above as a daily dosage for a period of four months. At the beginning and at the end of the study the lung volume was measured in each patient. During the study the asthma patients increased their lung volume in average by more than 20%. The most significant result of this study was the fact that the percentage of lung volume increase was much higher for those patients with the lowest base line values which indicates that this therapy is particularly valuable with patients with severe asthma and a severe breathing impairment as shown in table 1 hereof:

</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The concept of this invention was tested in a prospective clinical study with 18 tinnitus patients for a period of four months. The hearing capacity was objectively documented by audiometry. The before/after results of the audiometry measurements are shown in table 2 hereafter: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Five patients had little or no improvement of their hearing capacity (0-10 decibel &lsqb;dB&rsqb;), eight patients had improvements between 10 and 20 dB, two patients between 20 and 30 dB, two patients between 30 and 40 dB and for one patient an improvement of hearing capacity between 40 and 50 dB was documented.
