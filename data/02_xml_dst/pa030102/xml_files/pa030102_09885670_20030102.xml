<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to optical phased arrays and more particularly to control systems for optical phased arrays that compensate for phase changes due to external perturbations such as vibration and thermal variations as well as compensating for atmospheric aberrations external to a laser system. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Optical phased arrays are well known in the art and are used in a variety of applications for the purpose of generating an optical output having greater power than an optical input through the use of an array of emitters. More specifically, optical phased arrays have been used in laser systems to generate an output beam having high power levels in addition to high beam quality or brightness. High beam quality allows available light to be concentrated onto a small area at a large distance, which is advantageous in laser weapons systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The optical phased array is similar to phased array radar, wherein an array of emitters must be emitting light at precisely the same phase. However, matching the phases of the emitters at optical frequencies is more difficult than with radio frequencies, as used with phased array radar, due to the short wavelength of light. Additionally, external perturbations such as vibrations and thermal variations continuously alter the phase of each emitter. Further, atmospheric aberrations external to the laser system also change the phase of the emitters, wherein a control system may generate an arbitrary phase front to compensate for atmospheric propagation perturbations. Accordingly, a control system must be employed to realign the emitters to compensate for phase changes due to external perturbations and atmospheric aberrations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Generally, control systems measure the phase of each emitter compared with the phase of a reference signal and feedback phase correction signals to phase modulators that realign the phase of each emitter. Such techniques are referred to as near-field techniques, wherein the phase of each emitter is measured and controlled by using an interferometer to compare the phase of each emitter to the phase of a reference signal. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,694,408 to Bott et. al., assigned to McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. The phase modulators may realign the phases of the emitters to match a reference signal, or alternately, the phase modulators may realign the phases of the emitters to produce an output beam having a specific phase profile or phase taper. Furthermore, microprocessors having algorithms to calculate phase measurements and corrections are also employed in the known art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, the algorithms that are used in the known art to calculate phase measurements and corrections are computationally intensive and thus may not be capable of providing real-time feedback to the phase modulators if the optical phased array comprises a large number of emitters. For example, known art algorithms that use the near-field technique repeatedly sweep a reference beam by 2&pgr; radians while measuring the output for each emitter. Generally, timing information is used from the start of the sweep to the time when the output appears to determine the phase of the emitter, and the algorithm is further sensitive to the AC amplitude of the interferometer signal and also to the DC component thereof. As a result, the algorithm is computationally intensive and consumes valuable time that is needed to continuously correct the phases of the emitters. Additionally, conventional techniques are phase-nulling, and thus the control system cannot lock to an arbitrary phase front to compensate for atmospheric propagation perturbations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In addition to the near-field techniques, far-field techniques have also been employed in the known art to control elements of an optical phased array. The far-field technique has been used to align an array of semiconductor laser amplifiers by dithering the phases of the elements to achieve a beam with the narrowest far-field divergence. Unfortunately, the computational requirements of the near-field technique scale superlinearly in relation to the number of elements. Furthermore, the signal to noise ratio degrades linearly with the number of elements. As a result, laser systems comprising a large number of emitters for higher power output cannot be controlled real-time due to the computational time required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for an optical phased array control system that comprise computationally efficient algorithms in order to provide real-time feedback to compensate for phase changes due to external perturbations. Further, the algorithms should preferably be capable of calculating phase measurements and corrections with relatively high fidelity. Moreover, the algorithms should be capable of generating arbitrary phase-fronts for corrections due to atmospheric aberrations. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In one preferred form, the present invention provides an optical phased array control system comprising a master oscillator laser that produces a beam, which is split into a reference beam and a plurality of array beamlets. Generally, the phase of the reference beam and the phase of the array beamlets are measured and compared, wherein a computationally efficient algorithm computes both phase measurements and phase corrections. Accordingly, phase correction signals are transmitted to a plurality of phase modulators that correspond to each of the array beamlets. The phase modulators then realign the phases of the array beamlets to compensate for external perturbations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In operation, the array beamlets are first transmitted through a first fiber array where the beamlets are diverged into a first microlens array. Accordingly, the first microlens array generates a composite beam that is transmitted as an output beam from the system. The composite beam is further transmitted and interfered with a reference plane wave that is generated from the reference beam. The composite beam and the reference plane wave are then transmitted through a second microlens array where the array beamlets and the reference plane wave are focused to a second fiber array. The second fiber array then transmits the array beamlets and the reference plane wave to a plurality of photodetectors, which correspond with the array beamlets, wherein the photodetectors detect the phases of the reference plane wave and the array beamlets. Subsequently, the output from the photodetectors is transmitted to a computing device, such as a personal computer (PC), wherein the algorithm calculates a phase measurement and corrections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The phase measurement is generally the difference between the phase of a specific array beamlet and the phase of the reference plane wave. In addition, the phase correction for each array beamlet is calculated based on the phase measurement, as described in greater detail below. The phase correction signal is then transmitted to the phase modulators, which realign the phases of the array beamlets to match the phase of the reference beam such that a flat phase front is generated. Alternately, an arbitrary phase-front is generated to correct for atmospheric aberrations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As a part of the real-time control system, the reference plane wave is ramped from 0 to 2&pgr; radians using a reference phase modulator. Preferably, the ramp is achieved in four equally spaced steps for optimal results. Accordingly, a trigger is employed to send signals to the phase modulator and to the personal computer, wherein the algorithm uses a signal from the trigger to calculate the phase measurements and corrections as described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The phase measurement according to the algorithm is calculated based on a difference between the phase of the array beamlets and the phase of the reference plane wave. More specifically, the phase measurement is based on a phase angle of a complex number comprising square wave functions. The square wave functions are insensitive to AC amplitudes and DC components of the phase of the array beamlets and the phase of the reference plane wave, and as a result, the computations are less intensive and are capable of supporting real-time feedback to the phase modulators. In another form, the phase measurement is calculated based on a phase angle of a complex number comprising sine and cosine functions to correct for harmonic content of the phases of the array beamlets and the reference plane wave. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The phase corrections are calculated based on the phase measurement calculation times modulo2&pgr;. The phase correction signal is cumulative, and thus a current phase correction is subtracted from a previous phase correction for each cycle that measures phases and calculates the phase measurements and corrections. Accordingly, the cycle must be faster that the external perturbations in order to provide real-time phase control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In another form, a plurality of PCs may be employed for a large number of array beamlets, thereby reducing the computing load. As a result, a parallel real-time phase control system may be used that is capable of controlling relatively large optical phased arrays without exceeding available computing resources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The following description of the preferred embodiments is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, a real-time control system for an optical array according to the present invention is illustrated and generally indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As shown, the real-time control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a master oscillator laser <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a beam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that is split by a signal power splitter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> into a reference beam <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a plurality of array beamlets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the power splitter <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a passive coupler, such as the 3 dB coupler as illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Generally, the phases of the array beamlets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the reference beam <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are detected by a corresponding set of photodetectors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which transmit the phases in photodetector output signals <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to an algorithm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> within a computing device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The algorithm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> calculates phase measurements and phase corrections based on the phase of the array beamlets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> compared with the reference beam <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and transmits phase correction signals <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> to a corresponding set of phase modulators <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the phase modulators <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> realign the phases of array beamlets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to compensate for external perturbations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As further shown, the array beamlets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are transmitted through a first fiber array <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, where the array beamlets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> diverge into a first microlens array <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that generates a composite beam <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The composite beam <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is transmitted as an output beam <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by a first beam splitter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and is further transmitted through a second beam splitter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to a second microlens array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Additionally, a high quality reference plane wave <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is generated from the reference beam <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, preferably using a collimating lens <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The reference plane wave <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is then interfered with the composite beam <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by the second beam splitter <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and the reference plane wave <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is also transmitted to the second microlens array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The second microlens array <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> focuses both the composite beam <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which comprises array beamlets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the reference plane wave <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to a second fiber array <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which transmits the array beamlets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the reference plane wave <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to the photodetectors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the photodetectors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> detect the phase of each array beamlet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the reference plane wave <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and subsequently transmit the phases to the computing device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> through photodetector output signals <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. As shown, the computing device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> further comprises an analog to digital converter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> that converts an analog output of the photodetectors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to a digital input for the algorithm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Generally, the algorithm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> calculates a phase measurement, which is the difference between the phase of an individual array beamlet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the phase of the reference plane wave <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The phase measurement is further used to calculate a phase correction that is used for the phase correction signals <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which are transmitted to the phase modulators <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to correct for phase changes. Accordingly, the computing device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> further comprises a digital to analog converter <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that converts the digital signals from the algorithm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to an analog signal for the phase correction signals <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Both the phase measurement and the phase correction calculations of the algorithm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A trigger <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is used to ramp the phase of reference plane wave <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from 0 to 2&pgr; radians through the use of a reference phase modulator <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The trigger <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> also generates a trigger signal <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that is used by the algorithm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as described in greater detail below. As further shown, optical amplifiers <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may further be employed to amplify the array beamlets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as necessary. Additionally, a reference amplifier <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may also be employed to amplify the reference beam <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as necessitated by the particular application requirements. Although a total of four (4) array beamlets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are illustrated herein along with corresponding elements (phase modulators <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, photodetectors <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>), it shall be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any number of array beamlets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and elements may be employed according to the teachings of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a real-time control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used to realign the phases of the array beamlets <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to compensate for external perturbations. As shown, the real-time control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a closed-looped system that continuously provides feedback to the phase modulators <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> during continued operation of the master oscillator laser <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Algorithm </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Generally, the algorithm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> functions according to three (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) primary cycles: (1) ramping the reference plane wave <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from 0 to 2&pgr; radians and digitizing n points of the photodetector output signals <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>; (2) computing the phase measurement, &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>M</subscript></highlight>, which is the phase difference between the reference plane wave phase and an array beamlet phase; and (3) sending a phase correction signal, &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>E</subscript></highlight>, to each phase modulator <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that corresponds with an array beamlet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to ensure that each array beamlet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in phase with the reference plane wave <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Preferably, n&equals;<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in one form of the present invention, wherein optimal signal to noise ratios have been achieved in preliminary physical systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the sinusoidal photodetector output, p(&phgr;), is shown as the reference plane wave <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is ramped from 0 to 2&pgr; radians. As further illustrated, two square wave functions, c(&phgr;) and s(&phgr;) are also used by the algorithm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which are a part of the phase measurement calculation as more fully described in the following. Further, the trigger signal is also a square wave function. Accordingly, the square wave functions ignore the DC component of p(&phgr;) and are further insensitive to the AC amplitude of p(&phgr;), which greatly simplifies the calculations of the algorithm <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The phase measurement, &PHgr;<highlight><subscript>M</subscript></highlight>, is calculated according to Equation 1: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&PHgr;<highlight><subscript>M</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;arg</italic></highlight>(<highlight><italic>I&plus;jQ</italic></highlight>),&emsp;&emsp;(Eq. 1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Where arg( ) denotes the argument, or phase angle, of the complex number I&plus;jQ. Accordingly, I and Q are defined (for one ramp of reference plane wave <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>) according to Equations 2 and 3: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>I&equals;&int;p</italic></highlight>(&phgr;)<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>(&phgr;)<highlight><italic>d&phgr;</italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(Eq. 2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Where c(&phgr;) and s(&phgr;) are the square wave functions according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In another preferred form, c(&phgr;) and s(&phgr;) may alternately be cos(&phgr;) and sin(&phgr;) functions. As a result, the sine and cosine functions screen against harmonic content in p(<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> ). Accordingly, if p(&phgr;) is not a perfectly sinusoidal signal, c(&phgr;) and s(&phgr;) may result in a slight phase measurement error if p(&phgr;) has an undesirable harmonic content. However c(&phgr;) and s(&phgr;) are more computationally efficient than cos(&phgr;) and sin(&phgr;) since cos(&phgr;) and sin(&phgr;) would require additional multiplication steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> For a sampling of n points of p(&phgr;), I and Q are computed according to Equations 4 and 5:
