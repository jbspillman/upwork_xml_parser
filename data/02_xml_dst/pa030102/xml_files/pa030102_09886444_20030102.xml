<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Improvements in robotic technologies has increased the level of automation in many industries. From the automobile industry to the semiconductor manufacturing industry, robotic technology has automated many of the repetitive tasks formerly performed by humans. A benefit of the mechanical automation is the precision achievable by computer-controlled automated systems. For automated alignment or operational robotic systems, the programming of such robots is typically extensive, with much of the physical processing of the automated systems tied to the precise locations and measurements of the automated system and the objects on which it operates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In order to maintain precision, an automated alignment system is usually either (a) locked into a rigid positional frame of reference or (b) capable of &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; the objects and adjusting its positioning and processing to the objects&apos; orientation. Because maintaining a rigid frame of reference as a sole imaging or alignment method typically requires considerable effort, &ldquo;sight&rdquo;-automated systems, which typically have a combination of a fixed frame of reference and sighting means, are generally more reliable and economical to employ. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One successful method for building a &ldquo;sight&rdquo;-automated system has been to provide an automated system, such as an autochanger for large-scale computer storage, with an illumination source and optical sensing components. Imaging targets are typically affixed to the objects to provide a reflection point for the illumination source and image sensors of the system. The imaging targets are normally white in order to maximize the contrast between the background equipment and the target. As the illumination source shines or radiates over the white imaging target, optical sensors pick up the change in the reflected light based on the large contrast between the target and the background. In some applications, the imaging targets may also include bar codes, thereby providing an intelligence to the optical sensing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Still other applications may take advantage of a combination of both plain imaging targets and bar codes. Such systems use the plain imaging target to align with the object. The optical sensors are then generally able to read the bar code to determine whether the object is the correct target object. Furthermore, the bar codes may provide an initial reference to the automated system that indicates a general area of the system to which the automated sensor must generally move. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For example, multiple tapes of electronic information may be stored in magazines cataloged by bar code and stacked in racks or shelves. Each shelving unit generally has an imaging target used by the automated system to pinpoint different locations on the shelf. In such systems, a single illumination source and optical sensor is used to lock onto both the imaging target and the bar codes. This combination generally simplifies the design of the automated system and reduces operating costs. However, problems generally arise as the illumination source is positioned farther from the imaging target. Because only a single illumination source and optical sensor are used to image both elements, it may be positioned in such a manner to image one element more easily than the other or in such a manner to read both elements with the same, but non-optimal, difficulty. In typical embodiments, the illumination source and optical sensors are normally positioned to provide accurate reading of each individual tape&apos;s bar code. Thus, the greater distance between the illumination source and the general imaging target may sometimes cause failed or inaccurate detection by the optical sensing device. This problem could be alleviated by manufacturing a dual illumination source and optical sensor, or by increasing the size and intensity of the illumination source and/or the size and sensitivity of the optical sensor. However, both of these options add cost and complexity to the automated systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the white imaging targets frequently fail to provide adequate return radiation to register on the optical sensor. This failure may be caused by a background material that is glossy or shiny, creating a reflection comparable to the white imaging target. The failure to may also be caused by the particular shape of the object at the point on which the imaging target is affixed. If the object&apos;s facing is curved or angles away from the illumination source, the optical sensor may not register sufficient light reflection or contrast from the imaging target. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Because of the problems found in the current systems, it would be advantageous to have an imaging target capable of providing a high degree of return radiation. The present invention is directed to a system and method for providing an automated imaging system comprising an illumination source, a phosphorescent imaging target, and an optical imaging sensor for receiving luminance information emitted from the phosphorescent imaging target. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> illustrates a prior art autochanger typically used for mass computer storage of memory tapes and/or optical disks. Autochanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises mechanical picker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> which travels in a &lsquo;U&rsquo;-shaped path on track <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The storage media units are housed in shelves <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, which may be stacked one on top of the other, or may be housed in single story units. As mechanical picker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> selects the desired storage media units, the media units are placed into drives <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to provide access to the data stored thereon. Mechanical picker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> retrieves storage media units from shelves <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at many possible positions, such as positions <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&Prime;. The retrieved media units would then typically be placed into one of drives <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> at several possible positions, such as position <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&prime;. With the setup illustrated in autochanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, mechanical picker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> moves across track <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to pick the targeted storage units and then insert them into drives <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, or to retrieve the units from drives <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and return them to their designated positions in shelves <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> provides a more detailed illustration of mechanical picker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and shelving unit <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of autochanger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. In the prior art embodiment shown, the auto-changing system uses both a positional imaging target, target <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and an informational imaging target, bar codes <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight>. Shelf <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is shown with a capacity for holding storage media units, three of which, <highlight><bold>1021</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1023</bold></highlight>, are filled with storage media units, and two of which, <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight>, are empty. Target <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is affixed to shelf <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to provide mechanical picker means for calculating its relative position in front of shelf <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that while shelf <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is shown here with a five tape capacity, the present invention is not limited to such types of storage shelves. Alternative embodiments of the present invention may preferably operate with any number of different automated systems including other large-scale storage systems with varying storage capacities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Mechanical picker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes illumination source <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>, which typically comprise light emitting diodes (LEDs) or the like, to shine light onto target <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and/or bar codes <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight>. Optical sensor <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, which comprises lens <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and optical sensor array <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, receives reflected light from any of target <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and/or bar codes <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight>. Optical sensor array <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may comprise charge coupled devices (CCDs), contact image sensors (CISs), or other known optical imaging sensors. Optical sensor <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> acts as a bar code reader to read the information from bar codes <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight>. It also reads target <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to determine machine picker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>&apos;s relative position at shelf <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the prior art system depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, target <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is a right triangle. The locations of each tape or media unit in shelf <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are generally known to be a certain distance from the apex of the triangle of target <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Thus, if the position of the apex is known, mechanical picker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is typically capable of locating any tape or storage unit in shelf <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, simply by performing measured movements. The location process begins by performing vertical scans of the triangle to obtain its changes in height from one point to the next. After at least two such scans, the slope can be calculated using the known changes in triangle height. The system then uses the slope to predict and find the position of the triangle apex of target <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, target <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is typically placed at the edge of the range of optical sensor <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>. Lens <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a limited field of vision, shown by periphery <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight>. The light reflected into periphery <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> generally is focused onto optical sensor array <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for detection. Illumination from illumination source <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> begins to fade at the edges of periphery <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight>. Using the colored targets of target <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and bar codes <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight>, the fading illumination at the edge of periphery <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight> generally causes little light to reflect back from target <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the typical angle of incidence of light hitting target <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also contributes to the diminished level of light typically reflected into periphery <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight>. With a low amount of reflected light re-entering periphery <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight>, system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> often has a difficult time determining whether the reflected light is from target <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or from the background shelf <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is a detailed illustration of a phosphorescent imaging target according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Phosphorescent target <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably affixed to object <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which may be an item such as shelf <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B. As phosphorescent target <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is illuminated with light photons <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the phosphor material of phosphorescent target <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> absorbs some of the light energy, which, in turn, preferably excites atoms <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> within phosphorescent target <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As a result of the phosphorescence of the material, some of the light energy radiated at phosphorescent target <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably re-radiated out of phosphorescent target <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The re-radiated photonic illumination <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, thus, preferably creates a temporary illumination source out of phosphorescent target <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In contrast, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> illustrates an example prior art colored imaging target. The colored target is typically white to maximize contrast against the background. White target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is affixed to object <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which may be an item such as shelf <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>B. In contrast to phosphorescent target <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>), as white target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is illuminated with light photons <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, some of the light energy is absorbed into white target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. However, without the ability to have its atoms <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> excited to the same level as the phosphorescent material of the present invention, light is merely reflected or redirected from white target <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in dispersive light patterns <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. While re-radiated photonic illumination <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of phosphorescent target <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>) provides relatively strong, relatively coherent re-radiated light energy, dispersive light patterns <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference>) provide a much weaker aggregate of reflected light. Because of the phosphorescent attributes of phosphorescent target <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a strong return signal is beneficially produced, thus, making it easier for an optical sensor to register the re-radiated light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a detailed illustration showing components of an autochanger configured according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Similar to the autochanger depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, the autochanger of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> comprises shelf <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with storage columns <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> and mechanical picker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. However, the imaging targets of the autochanger according to this preferred embodiment of the present invention incorporate phosphorescent triangle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and phosphorescent bar codes <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight>. Using the phosphorescent characteristics of triangle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and bar codes <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight>, optical sensor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> may preferably be comprised of less sensitive, smaller, and, thus, less expensive components. Optical sensor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> would preferably comprise modified lens <highlight><bold>3020</bold></highlight> and modified sensor array <highlight><bold>3021</bold></highlight>. Similarly, modified illumination source <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> may preferably be smaller or may preferably comprise a light source of smaller intensity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In operation, as mechanical picker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> performs its initial vertical scans of triangle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the stronger re-radiated photonic illumination emitted from triangle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is more easily registered by modified sensor array <highlight><bold>3021</bold></highlight> through periphery <highlight><bold>1003</bold></highlight>. Because the surrounding background material does not fluoresce, modified sensor array <highlight><bold>3021</bold></highlight> may preferably differentiate the strong luminance information re-radiated from triangle <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> from the less-intense reflected light from the background material of shelf <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, even with a smaller, modified illumination source <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and less-sensitive optical sensor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Operating in this manner, optical sensor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> would preferably be capable of not only reading bar codes <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight>, but may also preferably be capable of detecting the presence of any given tapes, on which bar codes <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> may be disposed. Thus, as mechanical picker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is directed to a tape located in shelf <highlight><bold>1021</bold></highlight>, the luminance information reflected from bar code <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> on the tape signals the presence of the tape in shelf <highlight><bold>1021</bold></highlight>. Additionally, as mechanical picker <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is directed to a location of another particular tape, for example shelf <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight>, the lack of luminance information reflected from one of bar codes <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> would preferably indicate that the desired tape is not resident in the designated location of shelf <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Optical sensor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> would also preferably be capable of reading bar codes <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> more easily because of their phosphorescent material. However, it should be noted that bar codes <highlight><bold>3000</bold></highlight> are not required to be constructed with phosphorescent material. It should also be noted that phosphorescent imaging targets may be used with any number of different automated systems. Systems such as robotic welders, automated conveyor systems, and/or automated counters may also benefit from a preferred embodiment of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It should also be noted that while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates an autochanger utilizing the right triangle for determining the mechanical pickers positional relationship to the storage shelve, the present invention is not limited to automated systems which employ such methods of positional orientation determination. Many different means, including additional bar codes may be used along with alternative embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates an auto-mechanical optical alignment system. Unlike the autochangers of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A, 1B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, auto-alignment system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> moves the targeted object over the imaging equipment. Object <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is held on maneuvering arm <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> with bracket <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. Object <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> includes phosphorescent imaging targets <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> located in known positions. Maneuvering arm <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> moves object <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> across stationary optical sensor <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Optical sensor <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> comprises lens <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and optical array <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>. Illumination sources <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> provide the seed light energy for phosphorescent imaging targets <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. As object <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> passes over optical sensor <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, light energy from illumination sources <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> passes through window <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The light energy is absorbed by phosphorescent imaging targets <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and re-radiated out from each target as object <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> continues over the sensing area. Controller unit <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> receives the luminance information from optical array <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> through memory <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight>. Memory <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> supplies the luminance information to processor <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight> in order to calculate object <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&apos;s positional orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> One application of auto-alignment system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> could be to provide laser etching of a pre-milled putter head. As a block of solid metal, such as titanium, aluminum, and/or steel passes over optical sensor <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, phosphorescent imaging targets <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> preferably provide controller unit <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> with luminance information to calculate object <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&apos;s positional orientation. Controller unit <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> then preferably controls maneuvering arm <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to position object <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in the appropriate orientation over an etching laser (not shown). Once correctly positioned, the etching laser would preferably etch a design or name onto the pre-milled block of metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that alternative embodiments of the present invention may also be used in a variety of automated systems. For example, and not by way of limitation, simple counters may preferably use the phosphorescent imaging targets of the present invention to count the number of objects passed over the optical sensors. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, as object <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is moved over optical sensor <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> the light energy re-radiated from imaging targets <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> is preferably detected and received by processor <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight> as re-radiated photonic illumination from optical array <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> through memory <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight>. In response to the received re-radiated photonic illumination, processor <highlight><bold>491</bold></highlight> may preferably increment a counter for detecting the number of objects that have passed over optical sensor <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Such an alternative embodiment will, therefore, be capable of keeping track of the number of objects processed through the system. </paragraph>
