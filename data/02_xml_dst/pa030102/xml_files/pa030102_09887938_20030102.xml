<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to formation of ferrite layers having application in micro-electronic device manufacturing, and more particularly to spin-spray processes for ferrite film fabrication. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Conventional ferrite film fabrication techniques include sputtering, vacuum evaporation, molecular beam epitaxy and liquid phase epitaxy. While the correct chemistry can be obtained at close to ambient temperatures, formation of the desired crystaline phases using these techniques requires temperatures as high as 1000&deg; C. Some substrates, such as GaAs and plastics, may not withstand such high temperatures. Silicon-based integrated circuits often do not permit temperatures above 400&deg; C. for processes applied after the devices are fully formed. Ferrite films have also been formed by spraying an aqueous oxidizing agent solution on a substrate and simultaneously supplying an aqueous reaction solution containing ferrous ions to effect a crystallization reaction on the substrate. Such processes have been performed at temperatures below 100 &deg; C. These spray techniques, however, generally do not provide adequate in-plane anisotropy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In addition to these temperature issues, bulk ferrites typically have ferromagnetic resonance frequencies in the range of 100 to 300 MHz, limiting their use to devices operating below these relatively low frequencies. Beyond the ferromagnetic resonance frequency, the material can no longer respond to a magnetic field. Accordingly, above this frequency an inductive device can no longer act as an inductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is known that increased anisotropy in the film plane may increase ferromagnetic resonance frequency, thereby allowing operation at higher frequencies. Uniaxial anisotropy has been generated by crystallizing sputtered or vapor deposited amorphous films. The crystallization is typically promoted by heat treating the film in a magnetic field. These methods, however, usually require temperatures of between 350&deg; C. and 650&deg; C., thereby restricting their use to substrates and devices not adversely affected by temperatures in this range. Consequently, applications of such techniques are limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for a low temperature ferrite formation process, that preferably produces a highly anisotropic structure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> According to embodiments of the invention, a ferrite film is formed on a substrate wherein the substrate is exposed to a magnetic field during the deposition. As used herein, the term &ldquo;film&rdquo; and &ldquo;layer&rdquo; do not imply any particular thickness and do not limit the material to any thickness. Preferably the magnetic field is substantially uniform on the substrate. Substrate spinning may improve thickness uniformity of the ferrite layer, and may also rinse excess oxide particles away from the substrate surface. Advantageously, the formation process may be performed at temperatures less than about 300&deg; C. Performing the formation process at less than about 100&deg; C., is particularly advantageous given the current technology and process applications which may utilize aqueous solutions. For aqueous solutions, temperatures above 100&deg; C. demand a pressurized chamber to prevent boiling. It should be noted that embodiments of the invention include ferrite film formation at other than atmospheric pressure whether or not aqueous solutions are used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The ferrite film may be used in the fabrication of inductive devices operating at high frequency, such as devices having wireless applications. More particularly, small inductors may be formed directly on a semiconductor chip for use in power management or wireless signal processing. Micro-electronic devices, including but not limited to, semiconductor devices having operating frequencies in a range of about 100 MHz to about 3 GHz may be fabricated using ferrite films formed according to embodiments of the invention. An exemplary operating frequency range is about 1 GHz to about 3 GHz. The operating frequency, however, may be lower than the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequency. For example, to operate at 2 GHz, an FMR frequency of about 3 GHz would be required, implying an anisotropy field of 230 Oe, and the corresponding rotational permeability would be only &mgr;<highlight><subscript>rot</subscript></highlight>&times;23 With even this low permeability a fairly thick film (for example, 5 &mgr;m) could roughly double the inductance of a 50 &mgr;m wide Cu stripe inductor. Illustrative FMR frequency ranges are about 1 GHz to about 3 GHz, and about 1 GHz to about 2 GHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the invention may be used to deposit crystalline ferrite films on various substrate materials. Preferably deposition is at low temperatures such as about 100&deg; C. or less. The process depends on the controlled atomization of an aqueous oxidizing solution and an aqueous chloride solution of metal cations sprayed sequentially on the surface of a rotating, heated substrate. The aqueous oxidizing and chloride solutions are preferably preheated prior to atomization. The metal ions are oxidized and form a crystalline film on the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic of an illustrative deposition system according to an embodiment of the invention, and following is an exemplary use of the deposition system. A four liter oxidizing solution containing 30.0 grams of Na or NH<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>acetate (preferred buffer solution) and one gram of NaNO<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is prepared and held in container <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a four liter solution containing FeCI<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(9.0 g.), NiCI<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>6H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>0 (3.0 g.), ZnCI<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>(0.065 g.) and CoCI<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>6H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O (0.12 g.) is also prepared and held in container <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Bubbled nitrogen may be used in both containers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to prevent premature oxidation of the cations and NaNO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Pumps <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, draw stock solution at a predetermined rate from each container <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (preferably 50-60 ml/min). This may be accomplished, for example, with a gear pump and 0.125&Prime; diameter polypropylene tubing. Each solution is preferably preheated, for example, to about 96&deg; C., prior to atomization and deposition. The solutions may flow through a coil <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, for example a 4&Prime; diameter&times;14 turn coil of polypropylene, in a constant temperature bath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to effectuate preheating. The dwell time of the stock solutions through each coil should be sufficient to raise the liquid temperature to that of the bath. The solutions continue their journey to the atomizing spray nozzles <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. Nozzles <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be ultrasonically driven with adjustable power supplies <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and may be placed in pre-positioned holes in a 0.750&Prime; thick Teflon lid <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The higher the power level, the finer the spray. The lid seals the top of a reactor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, for example of Pyrex&reg; , within which deposition takes place. Additional holes may be provisioned for a spindle axle <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and a thermocouple <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. A hot plate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> may be used to heat reactor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and the preferably variable speed, rotating spindle <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> to the operating temperature (96&deg; C. for example). The water may be heated to temperature with a programmable stirring hot plate <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and maintained with control thermocouple <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. One or more outlet ports <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in reactor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be provided to maintain the liquid level during deposition and to drain the system upon completion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, spindle <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is a 5&Prime; diameter by 1.5&Prime; thick aluminum alloy cylinder with a 0.375&Prime; diameter&times;18&Prime; long stainless steel shaft extending from the upper surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In opposing positions and preferably about 0.250&Prime; in from the edge of the spindle, magnets <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are inserted in or on the spindle. The magnets may be, for example, samarium-cobalt bar magnets. Preferably magnets <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are inserted into wells within the spindle. One magnetic field is aligned parallel to the surface of spindle <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and radially to the axis of spindle <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The field of the opposite site is parallel to the surface of spindle <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and circumferential (90&deg;) to the axis. In addition, two magnets may be installed 90&deg; to the first magnets. One inch diameter magnets are suitable for the apparatus described in this paragraph. The fields of these additional magnets are preferably perpendicular to the spindle surface and are preferably rare earth magnets. The magnetic fields introduce anisotropy in the magnetic properties of the ferrite film. Any number and position of magnets may be used, provided that the desired fields are produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The strength of the magnetic field is preferably in the range of about 100 G to about 1500 G, and more preferably in the range of about 100 G to about 300 G. Magnets may be permanent magnets or electromagnets. The magnetic field is preferably in the plane of substrates <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, but may be tilted with respect to that plane. In general, magnets may be placed anywhere that produces the desired magnetic field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> To begin a deposition run, substrates <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> are mounted on the upper surface of spindle <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, for example, with double-sided masking tape and spring clamps. Spindle <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is positioned in water bath <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of the reactor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> such that the upper surface of spindle <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is above the water level, preferably by about 0.125 to 0.250&Prime; . The Teflon lid <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is put into place. The rpm of spindle <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is set and rotation initiated. Preferably the rotational speed is in the range of about 100 to about 3000 rpm, and more preferably in the range of about 800 rpm to about 2000 rpm. However, the speed may be higher than this range. Typically, higher rpm yield better quality films, for example by increasing smoothness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The constant temperature bath <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and liquid <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> in reactor <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are heated to temperature and the power to pumps <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and spray nozzles <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> turned on, preferably simultaneously. Thus, substrate <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, as it rotates on spindle <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, is exposed to alternating sprays of oxidizer and cation solutions. Spacing between nozzles <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the distance between the bottom of the nozzle and the substrate surface are critical parameters. Preferably, nozzles <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are placed directly over substrates <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, and the distance between nozzles <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the surface of substrates <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is in the range of about 35 &mgr;m to about 200 &mgr;m. Typically, the deposition time for an approximately 6 &mgr;m thick film at 800 rpm is 150 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The spin spray method is compatible with silicon technology, however there is a considerable mismatch between the coefficient of thermal expansion of the ferrite (&tilde;9&times;10&minus;6 &Dgr;L/L/&deg; C.) and that of the underlying Si(&tilde;3&times;10&minus;6&Dgr;L/L/&deg; C.). Mismatch may be overcome with appropriate intermediate layers between the ferrite and the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, embodiments of the invention allow use of intermediate layers to promote adhesion between the substrate and ferrite film. Use of such intermediate layers would not be possible in conventional ferrite film formation techniques because of high temperatures necessary in those methods. Embodiments of the invention include intermediate layers comprising a material having end groups orientated with respect to the intermediate layer surface on which the ferrite is deposited such that bonding of the ferrite to the intermediate layer is promoted. In an illustrative embodiment of the invention the intermediate layer is a SAM having a thiol end group. In addition to embodiments described in the experimental examples, SAMs may be employed having longer hydrocarbon chains and/or alcohol end groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Anisotropy may be increased by annealing the ferrite film after its formation Annealing after doping also increases anisotropy. In an exemplary embodiment the ferrite film is annealed at a temperature in the range of about 150&deg; to 400&deg; C. The experimental example provided introduction of Co to improve anisotropy in the presence of a bias field. Subsequent treatments of films incorporating Co may further increase the unaixial anisotropy. Furthermore, materials other than Co may be used for initial and subsequent treatments, for example Cu, Mg, Li. In an illustrative embodiment, the ferrite film is doped from about 0.01 weight percent to about 5.0 weight percent. In another illustrative embodiment, the doping range is about 0.2 weight percent to about 0.5 weight percent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The coercivity of ferrite films formed according to embodiments of the invention may be greater than that of ferrite formed according to conventional methods, due to greater anisotropy. An illustrative range of coercivity for ferrite films formed according to embodiments of the invention is about 10 Oe to about 200 Oe, with an exemplary range of about 40 Oe to about 60 Oe. An illustrative range of the ferrite film anisotropy is about 1000 dyn-cm/cm<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>to about 2&times;10<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>dyn-cm/cm<highlight><superscript>3. </superscript></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An illustrative thickness range of the ferrite film is about 0.5 &mgr;m to about 8 &mgr;m. A second illustrative thickness range is about 1 &mgr;m to about 5 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Following are experimental examples that contain parameters for illustrative embodiments of the invention. The invention, however, is not limited to the particular parameters set forth in the experimental examples. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Analytical Methods </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Phase formation and crystallinity of deposited films were studied by X-ray diffraction using a Philips Xray Diffractometer model XRG 3100. The incident x-ray beam was Cu K&agr; with a wavelength of 1.54178 &angst;. Samples were analyzed at 2&thgr; from 10-90&deg; at intervals of 0.05&deg; with a sampling time of 1.5 seconds. The morphology, microstructure, and film thickness were examined using a Leo FE-SEM model 1530. Evaluation of the film topography and surface roughness (RMS) was performed on an Explorer Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) from Topometrix. Three different (50&mgr;m&times;50&mgr;m) areas were analyzed. The scan speed of the tip was 100 &mgr;m/sec and the resolution was set at 200 pixels per line, yielding an equivalent lateral resolution of {fraction (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>)} &mgr;m. The obtained image was analyzed using software provided by the vendor (SPMLab Version 4.0), which automatically calculates the surface roughness either as an Area Ra or Area RMS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Quasi-static M-H loops were obtained using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) calibrated with a Ni standard. In-plane anisotropy was evaluated using an automated routine to measure remanence as a function of azimuthal angle. Once the easy and hard axes were identified, in-plane M-H loops were measured along these two directions, typically over the field range &minus;200-200 Oe. As expected, the magnetic easy axis was found to be parallel to the magnetic bias field applied during growth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Permeability spectra were obtained using a single-loop permeameter with an HP8753E network analyzer over a frequency range of 3 MHz-3 GHz. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Films were grown in a magnetic field by placing the substrate over permanent magnets so that the field lines were parallel to the film surface. This growth was shown to enhance the anisotropy in the final films as compared to films grown without the presence of a magnetic field. Introducing Co into the film further enhanced the anisotropy. Finally, annealing the films at 200&deg; C. also contributed to the increased anisotropy in the final films. The FMR for doped then annealed films, wherein the films were annealed in a magnetic field, was greater than about 2 GHz. Undoped films had FMRs of less than about 300 MHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Silicon substrates were also used. In some runs a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) layer having an anchoring group at its base and a functional group at one end was employed to improve adhesion between the ferrite layer and the silicon substrate. The compound H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>N(CH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>Si(OCH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, where the alkoxides give off alcohols forming R&mdash;Si&mdash;O&mdash;surface bonds that anchor the molecules to the surface, was tested. The amine end group is hydrophilic and can form a good base for the ferrite layer. Experiments showed that coatings with this particular SAM increases considerably the adhesion of the ferrite layer on the Si substrate </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In other runs a silica sol-gel layer was introduced on the silicon substrate to promote adherence of the ferrite layer. The smoothness and uniformity of resulting ferrite film was improved by increasing the spinning rate of the samples from 180 RPM to 800 RPM. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Films deposited at low temperatures (&lt;100&deg; C.) were polycrystalline. All films had a spinel structure, however, films deposited onto amorphous silica substrates tended to have a preferred orientation in the (111) plane while those deposited onto Al<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>were randomly oriented. All films had a columnar structure. The film thickness was determined by the deposition time and conditions and films from 1-7 &mgr;m thick were fabricated. The crystallite size was approximately 50 nm. The surface roughness was measured by contact AFM. Films, with an average thickness of 3.4 &mgr;m, had an RMS of 393 nm and Ra of 319 nm. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Magnetic Properties of the Experimental Ferrite Layer </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The films were found to be magnetically soft, with a large saturation magnetization (4&pgr;M&tilde;5000-6000 G), low coercive force (Hc&tilde;15-50 Oe), and a small field required to achieve complete saturation (Hs&tilde;50-200 Oe). The properties were closer to those of bulk ferrites sintered at 1200-1300&deg; C. (Hc&tilde;50-200 Oe,Hs&tilde;1 Oe) than to those of thin-film ferrites prepared by physical vapor deposition at modest temperatures (Hc&tilde;100 Oe, Hs&tilde;100-400 kOe). For the case where the applied field is applied parallel to the plane of the film, the M-H loop for (Ni,Zn)Fe<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>is characteristic of a soft magnetic material although the approach to saturation is more gradual than would be obtained in an ideal material. In the case where the field is applied perpendicular to the plane of the film, the loop is skewed due to demagnetization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The symmetry of the magnetic anisotropy of the films was evaluated using quasistatic M-H loops. The azimuthal variation of the remanence (magnetization at zero field, measured after first applying a field sufficient to saturate the sample) is directly indicative of the in-plane anisotropy magnitude and symmetry. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the remanence variation of a Co-doped film on an alumina substrate with no anneal and no bias field applied during deposition. Little in-plane anisotropy is shown for this sample. The normalized remanence, M(H&equals;0)/M(H&equals;300 Oe) shows only a small variation as a function of the direction of applied field, and a variation is not symmetric (i.e., the hardest and easiest directions are not 90&deg; apart). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the remanence variation of a Co-doped film on an alumina substrate with no anneal wherein the sample was resting on an alnico plate magnet during deposition. A more substantial anisotropy was observed with this sample. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The experimental examples provide illustrative parameters and characteristics of the ferrite film formation method, materials and apparatus according to illustrative embodiments of the invention. Embodiments of the invention, however, are not limited to that which is described in the examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described by illustrative embodiments, additional advantages and modifications will occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the invention in its broader aspects is not limited to specific details shown and described herein. Modifications, for example, to the ferrite layer composition, magnetic field strength and orientation, and to the ferrite layer deposition method, may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
