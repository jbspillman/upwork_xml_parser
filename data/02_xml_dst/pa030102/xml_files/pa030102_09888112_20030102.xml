<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to the field of Electro-magnetic wave measurement and particularly to techniques for measuring a magnetic field of an integrated circuit (IC) inside the IC package, including the IC without the IC packaging. And more particularly to IC&apos;s with densities about or greater than the current Large Scale Integrated (LSI) circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an example of a magnetic field distribution <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of a package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having an integrated circuit (IC), for example, a LSI or an Ultra Large Scale integrated (ULSI) circuit. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> the package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is shown with cut-away section <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> illustrating the IC inside the package. Conventionally, the magnetic field distribution <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> outside of the package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is determined using a magnetic probe or sensor <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> from which induced voltage measurements are taken. In other words, typically measurements are taken of the IC outside of the IC packaging. The induced voltage is caused by currents in the integrated circuit and is used to determine the magnetic field at the position of the magnetic probe or sensor <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One reason for determining the magnetic field distribution of the package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is to solve any Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI) problems that may be caused by the currents in the IC. In order to reduce the EMI, the source of the interference needs to be pinpointed. An example is given in Japanese Patent Application &ldquo;Apparatus And The Method For Detecting Electromagnetic Wave Source, And Method For Analyzing The Same,&rdquo; by Uesaka Koichi, JP11-117028, filed Apr. 23, 1999. However, as circuit sizes shrink, for example, today LSI&apos;s are produced by a 0.1 &mgr;m process, it is necessary to perform measurements of the magnetic field very close to the circuit wirings, for example, cut-away section <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> inside the package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, in order to pinpoint the source of potential interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In addition, determining the magnetic field distribution inside the IC package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, may lead to production of low noise integrated circuits. Locations on the IC with a relatively high magnetic field indicate relatively high noise points. Of the several conventional techniques to reduce the magnetic field at these points, an example is changing the line pattern to reduce the noise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Japanese Application No. JP11-006485, &ldquo;Method And Apparatus For Measuring Electromagnetic Field Strength And Method And Apparatus For Measuring Current And Voltage Distribution,&rdquo; by Satoshi Kazama, et. al., filed Jan. 13, 1999, discloses the use of a loop antenna as a probe to determine the magnetic field over, for example, a circuit board. Other examples given are a lead wire of several centimeters, a microstrip line (i.e., a planar transmission line), a unit of a component on a board, and a circuit substrate of an electrical equipment. The loop probe is used for measurements in the neighborhood of 2 mm from the submitted equipment. Thus the disclosed use was for improving magnetic field determinations above equipment, for example, a unit on a board, not for inside an IC package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the above Japanese Application No. JP11-006485, the electromagnetic field of the circuit board generates an electric field coupling current and a magnetic field coupling current in a loop antenna above the circuit board. In the probe the electric field coupling current and the magnetic field coupling current are outputted toward the same direction at a certain part of the loop probe, but toward opposite directions at another part of the loop probe. A first composite current, i.e., electric field coupling current and the magnetic field, measured at one end of the loop probe by a current measuring device, gives the electric field coupling current plus the magnetic field coupling current. A second composite current measured at the same end of the loop probe by the same current measuring device, after rotating the loop probe 180 degrees, gives the electric field coupling current minus the magnetic field coupling current. Therefore, the electric field coupling current and the magnetic field coupling current can be calculated using these two composite currents. And the electric field component and the magnetic field component of the electromagnetic field at the loop probe can be derived from these composite currents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, using Japanese Application No. JP11-006485 in determining the magnetic field distribution of an IC package has only a secondary improvement in the measurement of the magnetic near-field distribution. Thus the conventional technique provides sufficiently accurate magnetic field measurements, and there is no significant advantage in using the techniques disclosed in Japanese Application No. JP11-006485 over the conventional techniques in the case of packaged IC magnetic field measurements. In addition, Japanese Application No. JP11-006485 rotates the probe to take the composite current measurements, when using one current measuring device. This rotation is time-consuming and a more efficient method of taking measurements is needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to pinpoint the source of potential interference in IC&apos;s, measurements of the magnetic field on the order of tens of micrometers (&mgr;m), for example, 30 &mgr;m, above the IC wirings, i.e., inside the IC package, need to be made. Cut-away section <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> shows inside the IC package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. However, in measuring the magnetic field inside the IC package, a significant coupling capacitance due to the electric field develops and the accuracy of the magnetic field probe to measure only the magnetic field deteriorates. Therefore there is need for techniques which minimize the effect of the electric field on the magnetic field probe inside an IC package to improve the accuracy of measurements of the magnetic field distribution. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a magnetic field measuring method and device for accurately determining the magnetic field distribution of an integrated circuit inside the IC package, including the IC without the IC packaging. In one embodiment, induced voltages due only to the magnetic field are determined at measurement heights on the order of 30 &mgr;m, i.e., inside the IC package (or for example, the pre-packaged IC) by using a magnetic probe, having a loop of wire parallel to the current, for measuring the induced voltage of the horizontal component of the magnetic field. The induced voltage due to the electric field is removed by using a calculation including the difference of two measurements. The first measurement is taken with a voltage meter coupled to the first terminal of the loop of wire and ground coupled to the second terminal. And the second measurement has the couplings reversed due to a cross-bar switch, i.e., a voltage meter coupled to the second terminal of the loop of wire and ground coupled to the first terminal. Thus only the induced voltage due to the magnetic field remains, after the calculation. The magnetic field distribution for the integrated circuit may be determined by using the above procedure to scan a grid like pattern above the IC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment a method for determining a component of a magnetic field of an IC at a height above the IC on the same order of magnitude as a distance between the IC&apos;s lines is provided. The method includes measuring a first induced voltage, having a first electric field induced voltage, due to a current carrying line&apos;s electromagnetic field. A second induced voltage due to the current carrying line&apos;s electromagnetic field is measured, such that the second induced voltage includes a second electric field voltage that is substantially equal to the first electric field induced voltage; The component of the magnetic field is determined based on a difference between the first induced voltage and the second induced voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> An alternate embodiment of the present invention provides a method for determining a magnetic field for a current carrying line of a plurality of current carrying lines inside an IC package, for example a LSI or VLSI circuit package. The method includes, measuring a first induced voltage due to a current carrying line&apos;s electromagnetic field, where the first induced voltage has a first measured voltage proportional to a magnetic field produced by the current carrying line. Next, a second induced voltage due to said current carrying line&apos;s electromagnetic field is measured in a manner so that the second induced voltage has a second voltage that is substantially equal to a negative of the magnitude of the first measured voltage; and a component or part of the magnetic field is determined based on a difference between the first induced voltage and the second induced voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment provides a magnetic field probe for determining a magnetic field distribution of a LSI circuit, including: a measuring probe for measuring an induced voltage produced by an electromagnetic field of the LSI circuit at a height above the integrated circuit on a same order of magnitude as a distance between the LSI&apos;s circuit current carrying lines, the measuring probe including a first termination point coupled with a second termination point by an electronic circuit; a voltage measuring device for measuring the induced voltage; and a switch in which a first end is coupled to the measuring probe via the first and second termination points and a second end is coupled to the voltage measuring device and to ground, where when the switch is in a first position, the first termination point is coupled to the voltage measuring device and the second termination point is coupled to ground, and when the switch is in a second position, the first termination point is coupled to ground and the second termination point is coupled to the voltage measuring device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The following is a description of the embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a magnetic field probe of an embodiment of the present invention taking measurements from a circuit. Conventionally a magnetic field probe, illustrated by magnetic field probe <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, is used over the IC package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and has a size on the order of 1000 &mgr;m. When the measurement height is on the order of 30 &mgr;m inside the IC <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the magnetic field probe <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> has a size on the order of 30 &mgr;m. In this case, a coupling or parasitic capacitance, shown by coupling capacitor C <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, occurs between the circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the probe <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. For illustration purposes, a &ldquo;U&rdquo; shaped active current carrying line <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is shown on the horizontal plane <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> (parallel to circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>), where the circuit line <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is an example of a signal or power line of integrated circuit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The line <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> has an AC or a noise voltage source V<highlight><subscript>S </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> which drives current &ldquo;i&rdquo; <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> through line <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to ground <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. The two parallel lines of line <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> are spaced &ldquo;d&rdquo; &mgr;m apart. A magnetic field probe <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, having, in effect, an induction loop, is placed parallel to line <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and has a height &ldquo;h&rdquo; &mgr;m <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> above horizontal plane <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>. The magnetic field probe <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be moved in the x-direction <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> (i.e., &ldquo;x&rdquo; <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>), that is perpendicular to line <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> or in the y-direction <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> parallel to line <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The current line <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> has a magnetic field shown by H <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and H <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. The horizontal component of magnetic field H <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> induces a voltage in magnetic field probe <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The current <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> also causes an electric field represented by a coupling capacitor C <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, which also induces a voltage in magnetic field probe <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. To determine an accurate or &ldquo;true&rdquo; magnetic field measurement at the position of the magnetic field probe <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the voltage due to coupling capacitor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> must be removed from the calculation of the magnetic field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a curve <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> for the required measurement height h <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> for a given resolution distance d <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The given resolution distance d <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> represents the distance between, for example, IC power lines. And the measurement height h <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is the bottom of the probe <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> height above the power line. For a conventional measurement using a probe <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> over a power pin of a circuit package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, d&equals;250 &mgr;m <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and h&equals;375 &mgr;m <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. For testing of one embodiment of magnetic field probe <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, a power line for line <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> was used with d&equals;20 &mgr;m <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> and h&equals;30 &mgr;m <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the induced voltage <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> measured by the magnetic field probe <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in mV versus the measurement height h <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> due to the magnetic field and the capacitor coupling for inside the LSI circuit package <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> and for outside the LSI circuit package <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> of an embodiment of the present invention. Line <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> shows the induced voltage <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> generated by the magnetic field outside the LSI circuit package <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> and line <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> shows the induced voltage <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> generated inside the LSI circuit package <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. Line <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> shows the induced voltage <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> generated in the magnetic field probe by the capacitive coupling for both outside the LSI circuit package <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> and inside the LSI circuit package <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows that the induced voltage (line <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>) due to the capacitive coupling is about 20 times less than the induced voltage (line <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>) due to the magnetic field for outside the LSI circuit package <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>. However, inside the LSI circuit package <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>, the induced voltage (line <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>) due to the capacitive coupling is larger than the induced voltage (line <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>) generated by the magnetic field. Thus the capacitive coupling only presents a serious problem in the measurement of the magnetic field inside the LSI circuit package <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates that outside the LSI circuit package <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, capacitive coupling is a secondary effect, and in conventional magnetic field measurement systems is ignored. Thus using the system as disclosed by JP Application No. 2000-206163 for measuring the magnetic field distribution of one or more LSI devices on a circuit board has no significant advantages over the conventional systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention the magnetic field measurements are taken inside the IC with the magnetic probe&apos;s measuring height above the IC on the same order of magnitude as a distance between the IC&apos;s current carrying lines inside the IC package. In addition the magnetic probe may optionally have about the same dimensions (for example, length and width) as the measurement height above the IC. A simplified example, with d&equals;20 &mgr;m, is that h&equals;30 &mgr;m and a square magnetic probe has dimensions of 30 &mgr;m by 30 &mgr;m. </paragraph>

The induce voltage <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight> measured by the magnetic field probe is given in milli-volts on the vertical axis. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a 10 times scale model of the probe <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and line <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> on horizontal plane <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>.

The graph <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> shows the theoretical curve for the induced voltage due only to the magnetic field. There exists a null between the two cross-sections <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, because the current goes into the page at <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> and comes out of the page at <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. At the center plane between the cross-sections <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>, the horizontal component of the magnetic field due to each cross-section cancels the other. However, the measured value of the induced voltage by the magnetic field probe is given by graph <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. The graph <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> illustrates an induced voltage due both to a magnetic field, as well as, the electric field. </paragraph>

The current i <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> comes from a AC (or a noise) voltage source V<highlight><subscript>S </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> and the current i <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight> has magnetic field H <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> which induces current <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> in probe <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>. Note that voltage source V<highlight><subscript>S </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> is the varying voltage and the bias voltage, if any, is not shown.

The magnetic field probe system includes a coil or loop <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>, a switch <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>, a connection to ground <highlight><bold>1032</bold></highlight>, and a connection to a voltage meter <highlight><bold>1034</bold></highlight>. The switch <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> may be, for example, a crossbar switch, connecting voltage meter <highlight><bold>1034</bold></highlight> to terminal <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> and ground <highlight><bold>1032</bold></highlight> to terminal <highlight><bold>1042</bold></highlight> (switch position A) or alternately connecting voltage meter <highlight><bold>1034</bold></highlight> to terminal <highlight><bold>1042</bold></highlight> and ground <highlight><bold>1032</bold></highlight> to terminal <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> (switch position B).

The switches <highlight><bold>2104</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2104</bold></highlight>B have one output connected to terminal resistors <highlight><bold>2105</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>2105</bold></highlight>B to ground and the other outputs connected to each other and to a wire or network <highlight><bold>2103</bold></highlight>.

The objective is to obtain a magnetic field distribution analogous to <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but for a distance h on the order of 30 &mgr;m above the IC <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> rather than 1000 &mgr;m above the package <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a grid of x <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight> versus y <highlight><bold>1054</bold></highlight> in which a magnetic field probe <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> (or <highlight><bold>1053</bold></highlight> which is probe <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> rotated by 90 degrees) like that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is moved in order to measure the x-component and y-component of the magnetic field H. These two components represent the mathematical basis making up the vector component of the magnetic field H in a horizontal plane such as <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In other embodiments any other two independent vectors may be uses as the basis, and the grid modified appropriately. First probe <highlight><bold>1053</bold></highlight> which is shown parallel to line <highlight><bold>1066</bold></highlight> is moved along the y component path starting with <highlight><bold>1066</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1068</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1072</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1074</bold></highlight> and so on, where the probe <highlight><bold>1053</bold></highlight> is parallel to grid lines <highlight><bold>1066</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>1074</bold></highlight>. On grid lines <highlight><bold>1068</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1072</bold></highlight> the probe <highlight><bold>1053</bold></highlight> takes no measurements. Two measurements of induced voltages, i.e., V<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>, are taken at each grid point or intersection of the x <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight> and y <highlight><bold>1054</bold></highlight> lines. And for each grid point a V<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>is calculated for the x-component vector of the magnetic field H<highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>, where the x-component vector of H is proportional to V<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>. Then probe <highlight><bold>1053</bold></highlight> is rotated 90 degrees, e.g., probe <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>, to measure the y-component, H<highlight><subscript>y </subscript></highlight>and in parallel follows the path <highlight><bold>1056</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> (via <highlight><bold>1058</bold></highlight>), and <highlight><bold>1064</bold></highlight> (via <highlight><bold>1062</bold></highlight>) and so on. Again two induced voltage measurements, V<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>and V<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>, are taken at each grid point and a V<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>is calculated for the y-component vector of the magnetic field H, where the y-component vector of H is proportional to V<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>. Lastly, the x-component vector and y-component vectors are vectored added for each grid point to give the magnetic field at that grid point. Thus a magnetic field distribution is determined for the IC circuit close to the circuit itself. These calculations are made using a computer and the magnetic field may be plotted graphically on a display. In an alternative embodiment the probe <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> is first moved along the x-axis and then rotated 90 degrees (probe <highlight><bold>1053</bold></highlight>) to move along the y-axis. In another embodiment probe <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> is first moved along the x-axis <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight> and then rotated 90 degrees and again moved along the same path on the x-axis <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight>. In still another embodiment there may be a plurality of probes, for example probe <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> may move along the x-axis <highlight><bold>1052</bold></highlight> concurrently with probe <highlight><bold>1053</bold></highlight> moving along the y-axis <highlight><bold>1054</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> gives a simplified flowchart for the determination of the magnetic field at a grid point above the IC of an embodiment of the present invention. These steps or functions may be performed using software on a computer having a processor and a memory. At step <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> the magnetic field probe <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> is moved to a (x, y) position according to the pattern given by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> above. V<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>is measured using voltmeter <highlight><bold>1034</bold></highlight> and the result stored in the computer memory (step <highlight><bold>1082</bold></highlight>). The crossbar switch <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> is then toggled or switched (step <highlight><bold>1084</bold></highlight>) under control of the computer and V<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>is next measured using voltmeter <highlight><bold>1034</bold></highlight> and the result stored in the computer memory (step <highlight><bold>1086</bold></highlight>). The computer then uses equation 4 to calculate V<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>and this value is stored as the voltage induced by the magnetic field for probe position (x, y) (step <highlight><bold>1088</bold></highlight>) for either the x direction or y direction depending upon the path the probe <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> is on as given in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. The next step <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> is optional and switches back or toggles the crossbar switch <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> to the original position. The computer then moves the probe to the next grid position according to the procedure described for <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> above and the process is repeated (step <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight>). In an alternative embodiment step <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> is omitted and steps <highlight><bold>1082</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1086</bold></highlight> are exchanged for every other iteration of steps <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>1088</bold></highlight>. This is because, for example, on the next iteration, V<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>is measured first, then V<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>is measured. Then on the iteration after the next iteration V<highlight><subscript>P </subscript></highlight>is measured first, then V<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>is measured and so on. After all the x and y components of V<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>are calculated, the magnetic field distribution for the gird is determined as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows graphs of the induced voltage <highlight><bold>1116</bold></highlight> measured by the magnetic field probe (like that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) versus horizontal distance x <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> of one embodiment of the present invention. The graphs shown are for a ten times (10&times;) enlarged model of that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>; thus, d&equals;200 &mgr;m and h&equals;300 &mgr;m (rather than d&equals;20 &mgr;m and h&equals;30 &mgr;m). The enlarged model was used only for simplifying the test, and the results are substantially the same for the actual size magnetic probe. Graph <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> shows the measured values for the induced voltage V<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>, and the graph <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> shows the measured values for the induced voltage V<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>. Taking the difference or (V<highlight><subscript>P</subscript></highlight>&minus;V<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>) gives a resulting graph <highlight><bold>1140</bold></highlight>, which is the calculated value for 2&times;V<highlight><subscript>H </subscript></highlight>given by equation 4 above. The two theoretical graphs of the magnetic field are given by graph <highlight><bold>1130</bold></highlight> which is plus 10 percent of the theoretical value and graph <highlight><bold>1132</bold></highlight> which is minus 10 percent of the theoretical value. The calculated value (2&times;V<highlight><subscript>H</subscript></highlight>) <highlight><bold>1140</bold></highlight> is between the two theoretical graphs <highlight><bold>1130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1132</bold></highlight> and therefore is equal to the theoretical value of the magnetic field alone within the 10 percent margin. </paragraph>
