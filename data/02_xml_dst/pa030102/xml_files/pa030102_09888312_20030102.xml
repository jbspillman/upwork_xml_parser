<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A bi-fuel engine has a gaseous fuel mode engine start strategy that delivers a calibrated amount of supplemental gasoline during engine starting and initial gaseous fuel engine runs. The strategy is embodied in an algorithm employing variables including start of supplemental gasoline fueling, end of supplemental gasoline fueling, ramp-in period of supplemental gasoline fueling, ramp-out period of supplemental gasoline fueling, and the fraction of supplemental gasoline fuel to be delivered relative to that which is normally delivered during a conventional gasoline start. The algorithm differentiates between hot and cold engine starts for determining how much supplemental gasoline is to be delivered during gaseous fuel starts, wherein hot starts occur before substantially complete diffusion of gaseous fuel in the intake system, and cold starts occur after diffusion of gaseous fuel in the intake system is substantially complete. Time required for substantially complete diffusion depends on geometry of the intake system. The gaseous fuel start strategy allows for modification (i.e. calibration) of criteria used for hot and cold start determination for different vehicles. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to improvements in bi-fuel engines that alternatively use gasoline or gaseous fuels, and particularly to enhanced starting performance, i.e. decrease in engine start times for gaseous fuel starts that follow gasoline engine operation, and improved start consistency for gaseous fuel starts that follow gaseous fuel engine operation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a bi-fuel engine utilizing the combination of a) a gaseous fuel throttle body induction fueling strategy for delivery of gaseous fuel, such as compressed natural gas, and b) port fuel injection for delivery of gasoline fuels, certain shortcomings plague normal performance of the gaseous fuel operational mode. In particular, long starting times are generally associated with gaseous fuel starts following gasoline engine operation. The long starting times are attributable to the delivery of gaseous fuels upstream of the throttle body. In such cases there is a considerable delay (i.e. as much as three to four seconds) associated with engine starting times as a result of normal time for transport of gaseous fuel from fuel metering devices to the engine cylinders. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Moreover, inconsistent start quality has been associated with gaseous fuel starts following gaseous fuel engine runs. When the engine is shut down following gaseous fuel operation, a significant quantity of residual, unburned fuel may remain trapped in the intake system between the point of fuel introduction and the engine. While the engine is off, the gaseous fuel slowly bleeds out of the intake system. The quality and consistency of subsequent starts can vary considerably, depending on how long the engine has been off; i.e. how much of the gaseous fuel has bled out of the intake system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One major drawback of prior art systems has been a lack of control of amounts of gasoline used to reduce gaseous fuel starting times. In some bi-fuel engine systems wherein gasoline has been used during starting, the starting has been difficult to control at best, as such systems have not been programmed to include robust pulse width control. In addition, such systems have lacked accommodation for soak times. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This invention provides a gasoline assisted gaseous fuel start strategy or method to address the aforementioned issues by providing a calibratable quantity of supplemental gasoline to be delivered during gaseous fuel engine starting and initial engine run. In one preferred form, the method employs a series of calibration tables that address and facilitate control of the following parameters: start of supplemental gasoline fueling, end of supplemental gasoline fueling, ramp-in period of supplemental gasoline fueling, ramp-out period of supplemental gasoline fueling, and the fraction of supplemental gasoline fuel to be delivered relative to the quantity of gasoline that would normally be delivered during a conventional gasoline start. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The method also involves differentiation between hot and cold starts for determining how much supplemental gasoline is to be delivered during gaseous fuel starts. As defined in this invention, a &ldquo;cold start&rdquo; refers to a start that occurs after diffusion of residual gaseous fuel in the intake system is deemed to be substantially complete, while a &ldquo;hot start&rdquo; refers to a start that occurs before substantially complete diffusion of residual gaseous fuel in the intake system. The time required for substantially complete diffusion of residual gas depends on the geometry of any given intake system. The gasoline assisted gaseous fuel start strategy of this invention provides a means to modify (i.e. calibrate) the criteria used for hot and cold start determination so that the method can be readily applied to different vehicles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another feature embodied by the method is actual calibration of the quantity of supplemental gasoline fueling based on the fuel type used for the previous engine operating cycle. This is important because for gaseous fuel starts that follow gasoline engine operations, the intake system does not contain any significant quantity of residual fuel. For gaseous fuel starts following gaseous fuel engine operation, the intake system may contain a considerable quantity of residual fuel depending on how long the engine has been shut down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Use of the gasoline assisted gaseous fuel start strategy of this invention makes it possible to sufficiently enrich the air-fuel ratio in the intake system, over a wide range of conditions, to provide consistent gaseous fuel start performance. Application of the strategy to a compressed natural gas (CNG) bi-fuel vehicle demonstrated reduced starting times, and improved consistency of gaseous fuel starts. For specific instances where CNG bi-fuel vehicles were started on CNG following gasoline operations, start times were reduced from 3-4 seconds to about 0.5 seconds under the strategy of this invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The following terms and definitions will be used herein as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Injector Pulse Width: amount of time, measured in microseconds for how long gasoline fuel injectors stay open per spray; actual amount of spray depends on fuel pressure for a given injector pulse width. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Normal_PW&mdash;the gasoline fuel injector pulse width (PW) that would normally be delivered during a conventional gasoline start. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Gas_Assist_Mult:&mdash;fraction of the supplemental gasoline fuel to be delivered during a gasoline assisted gaseous fuel start relative to the quantity of gasoline that would normally be delivered during a conventional gasoline start. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Engine_Run_Flag&mdash;this flag is set if the engine is currently running, and is clear if the engine is not running (e.g. if a stall has occurred or the engine is starting). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Gaseous_Fuel_Mode_Flag&mdash;this flag is set if the ECM software has determined that the engine should be started and run on the gaseous fuel. This flag is clear if the ECM software has determined that the engine should be started and run on gasoline fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Stall_Onset_Flag&mdash;this flag is set if the onset of an engine stall has been detected, and is otherwise clear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Last_Engine_Run_Used_Gasoline_Flag&mdash;this flag is set if the engine was last operated on gasoline fuel and is clear if the engine was last operated on gaseous fuel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> False_Start_Disable_Flag&mdash;this flag is set if a false start<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>has been detected and the ECM has determined that it is desirable to disable supplemental gasoline fueling following detection of a false start. <footnote id="FOO-00001"><highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>Within the context of this invention, a false start refers to the condition where an engine starts but then immediately stalls due to an excessively rich or lean air-fuel mixture. </footnote></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Barometric_Pressure&mdash;barometric pressure as determined by the ECM software. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Curr_Ref_Pulse&mdash;the number of accumulated crankshaft reference pulses since the start of engine crank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Start_Up_Coolant_Temperature&mdash;the coolant temperature of the vehicle at the start of engine crank. This variable is continuously updated until the engine has started. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Soak_Time&mdash;length of time that the engine has been shut off since the last operating cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> (Definitions of other terms or expressions employed herein are self-explanatory.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The hereindescribed invention contemplates that the gasoline assisted gaseous fuel start strategy or method be incorporated as a software algorithm in a conventional engine control module (ECM) to improve gaseous fuel start performance of a bi-fuel vehicle. Once integrated into the ECM software, the algorithm is preferably executed at the same frequency as normal gasoline fuel injector pulse width calculations to insure that all supplemental gasoline fueling parameters are commensurately updated prior to each fuel injection event. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The desired output of the strategy is a calibrated fuel injector pulse width for supplemental gasoline fueling during gaseous fuel starts. The basic premise of the strategy is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which graphically illustrates how the algorithm controls the quantity of supplemental gasoline fuel delivered during a gaseous fuel start. The x-axis, labeled &ldquo;Crankshaft Reference Pulses&rdquo;, represents the number of crankshaft reference pulses that have accumulated since the start of engine crank. The y-axis, labeled &ldquo;Gasoline Fuel Multiplier&rdquo;, represents the fraction of gasoline fuel delivered during a gaseous fuel start relative to the injector pulse width of a conventional gasoline start, where the value &ldquo;1&rdquo; represents the amount of fuel supplied for a normal gasoline start for a given bi-fuel engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Supplemental gasoline fueling is started when the number of accumulated crankshaft reference pulses is equal to Start_Ref_Pulse and is ramped-in over a period of crankshaft reference pulses equal to Ramp_In_Period. Supplemental gasoline fueling ends when the number of accumulated crankshaft reference pulses is equal to End_Ref_Pulse and is ramped-out over a period of crankshaft reference pulses equal to Decay_Period. The pulse width of supplemental gasoline fuel injections is thus limited to a fraction of Gas_Assist_Mult relative to the pulse width that would normally be commanded during a conventional gasoline start. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A detailed application of one preferred method of the strategy of the present invention is presented in the flow diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. In all cases it is assumed that all relevant variables have been updated by the ECM software prior to any given algorithm execution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The primary output of the algorithm is the variable Gas_Assist_PW, which is the fuel injector pulse width used to control the gasoline fuel injectors during a gaseous fuel start. The algorithm cycle is initiated by a first check of the state of the Gaseous_Fuel_Mode_Flag at Decision <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. If the ECM has determined that the engine should be operated on gaseous fuel (i.e. the flag is set), execution proceeds to Decision <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. If the Gaseous_Fuel_Mode_Flag is clear (i.e. if the ECM has determined that the engine is to be operated on gasoline fuel, the algorithm is exited. At Decision <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the Engine_Run_Flag is tested. If the flag is set, indicating that the engine is currently running, execution proceeds to Decision <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> where the Stall_Onset_Flag is evaluated. If the Stall_Onset_Flag is set, indicating that an engine stall is imminent, program execution jumps to Task <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> where Gas_Assist_PW is set to 0, and the algorithm is exited. It may not always be desirable to include Decision <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> as part of the fuel start strategy if there is uncertainty surrounding the likely cause of stall onset. The inclusion of Decision <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> assumes that the algorithm is calibrated such that there is a high degree of certainty that pending stalls would normally be the result of an over-rich air-fuel ratio. In such a case, shutting off supplemental gasoline fueling (i.e. setting Gas_Assist_PW to zero) increases the chance of recovering from a pending stall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Calculation of the start of supplemental gasoline fueling, which is represented by the Start_Ref_Pulse variable, begins with Decision <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. If the engine was last operated on gasoline (i.e. the Last Engine_Run_Used_Gasoline_Flag is set), Task <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> assigns Start_Ref_Pulse a value of Calibration <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and program execution proceeds to Task <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. If the engine was last operated on the gaseous fuel, the Soak_Time is calculated by Task <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> For ECMs capable of operating a timer while the vehicle ignition is off, the Soak_Time will be simply the accumulated value of a timer that was started when the ignition was turned off, and then halted upon detection of subsequent engine starting. For ECMs not capable of operating a timer with the ignition off, an estimate of Soak_Time can be made based on the difference between coolant temperature when the engine was shut down and coolant temperature when subsequent engine starting is detected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> If the ECM software has determined that supplemental gasoline fueling should be disabled due to detection of a false start, as indicated by the state of the False_Start_Disable_Flag in Decision <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the Soak_Time is compared to Calibration <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. False starts can result in the formation of an excessively rich air-fuel ratio in the intake system. Calibration <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> provides a means to disable supplemental gasoline fueling until sufficient time has been allowed for dilution of the air-fuel mixture in the intake system. If the Soak_Time is greater than Calibration <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, enough time is deemed to have elapsed since the false start to re-enable supplemental gasoline fueling, and the False_Start_Disable_Flag is cleared (Task <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>). Execution proceeds then to Task <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. If enough time has not elapsed since the detection of the false start, Gas_Assist_PW is set to zero (Task <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>), and the algorithm is exited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> At Decision <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, Soak_Time is compared to Calibration <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Immediately after shutting off the engine following gaseous fuel operation, the air-fuel mixture in the intake system is normally close to stoichiometric. Until some of the gaseous fuel has bled out of the intake system, it may not be desirable to enable supplemental gasoline fueling for a subsequent re-start. Calibration <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is used to disable supplemental gasoline fueling until sufficient time has elapsed to warrant fueling enrichment during a gaseous fuel start. While Soak_Time is less than or equal to Calibration <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, Gas_Assist_PW is set to zero (Task <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>), and the algorithm is exited. If Soak_Time is greater than Calibration <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, program execution proceeds to Decision <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The purpose of Decision <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is to categorize the gaseous fuel start as hot or cold. Within the context of this document, a &ldquo;cold start&rdquo; refers to a start that occurs after diffusion of residual gaseous fuel in the intake system is deemed to be substantially complete, while a &ldquo;hot start&rdquo; refers to a start that occurs before substantially complete diffusion of residual gaseous fuel in the intake system. If Soak_Time is greater than Calibration <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the residual gaseous fuel is deemed to have sufficiently diffused, the Hot_Restart_Flag is cleared (Task <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) and Start_Ref_Pulse is assigned a value of Calibration <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> (Task <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>). If Soak_Time is less than or equal to Calibration <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the Hot_Restart_Flag is set (Task <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), and Start_Ref_Pulse is assigned an entry from Table 1, based on the value of Soak_Time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> At Task <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the value of Start_Ref_Pulse is finalized by applying a multiplier, obtained from Table 2, which is based on barometric pressure:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Start_Ref_Pulse&equals;Start_Ref_Pulse&times;Table 2(Barometric_Pressure)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> At Decision <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the value of Start_Ref_Pulse is checked. If Start_Ref_Pulse&equals;0, Gas_Assist_PW is set to zero (Task <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>), and the algorithm is exited. The check at Decision <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> allows the supplemental gasoline fueling to be selectively disabled. For example, if Calibration <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is zero, and Calibration <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, Table 1 and Table 2 contain non-zero values, supplemental gasoline fueling will only be disabled for gaseous fuel starts that follow gasoline engine operation. Similarly, supplemental gasoline fueling can be disabled for specific values of Soak_Time, or a range of Soak_Time, by zeroing the corresponding Table 1 entry or entries. Supplemental gasoline fueling can also be disabled at specific altitudes (i.e. barometric pressures) by zeroing entries in Table 2. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The calculated value of Start_Ref_Pulse is compared to the current crankshaft reference pulse (Curr_Ref_Pulse) at Decision <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. If Curr_Ref_Pulse is less than Start_Ref_Pulse, Gas_Assist_PW is set to zero (Task <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>), and the algorithm is exited. If Curr_Ref_Pulse is greater than or equal to Start_Ref_Pulse, algorithm execution proceeds to Decision <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Calculation of the end point for supplemental gasoline fueling (End_Ref_Pulse ) begins at Decision <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with the evaluation of the Last_Engine_Run_Used_Gasoline_Flag. If the flag is set, indicating that the engine was last operated on gasoline, End_Ref_Pulse is assigned a value of Calibration <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> (Task <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). If the engine was last operated on the gaseous fuel (i.e. the Last_Engine_Run_Used_Gasoline_Flag is clear), the Hot_Restart_Flag is evaluated (Decision <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). If the Hot_Restart_Flag is set, End_Ref_Pulse is assigned a value from Table 3 based on Soak_Time (Task <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>). If the Hot_Restart_Flag is clear, End_Ref_Pulse is set equal to Calibration <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> (Task <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> At Task <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the value of End_Ref_Pulse is finalized by applying a multiplier, obtained from Table 4, which is based on barometric pressure:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>End_Ref_Pulse&equals;End_Ref_Pulse&times;Table 4(Barometric_Pressure)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Actual calculation of the ramp-in period for supplemental gasoline fueling (Ramp_In_Period) begins at Decision <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> with the evaluation of the Last_Engine_Run_Used_Gasoline_Flag. If the flag is set, indicating that the engine was last operated on gasoline, Ramp_In_Period is assigned a value of Calibration <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (Task <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>). If the engine was last operated on the gaseous fuel (i.e. the Last_Engine_Run_Used_Gasoline_Flag is clear), the Hot_Restart_Flag is evaluated (Decision <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>).

As an example, for gaseous fuel starts following gasoline engine operation, it would not normally be desirable to ramp-in the supplemental gasoline fuel. For this case, Calibration <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be set to zero, thereby eliminating the ramp-in period. The ramp-in period for other start modes can be similarly eliminated by setting the appropriate Calibration to zero (i.e. Calibration <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> or entries in Table 5 or Table 6). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Calculation of Gas_Assist_Mult begins with Decision <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. Gas_Assist_Mult is a variable containing the fraction of normally delivered gasoline fuel (i.e. the injector pulse width that would be commanded during a conventional gasoline start) to be delivered during a gaseous fuel start. If the Last_Engine_Run_Used_Gasoline_Flag is set, indicating that the engine was last operated on gasoline, Gas_Assist_Mult is assigned a value of Calibration <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (Task <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>). If the engine was last operated on the gaseous fuel (i.e. the Last_Engine_Run_Used_Gasoline_Flag is clear), the Hot_Restart_Flag is evaluated (Decision <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>). If the Hot_Restart_Flag is set, Gas_Assist_Mult is assigned a value from Table 9 based on Soak_Time (Task <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight>). If the Hot_Restart_Flag is clear, Gas_Assist_Mult is set equal to Calibration <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (Task <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>). At Task <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the value of Gas_Assist_Mult is modified by applying a multiplier based on barometric pressure that is obtained from Table 10:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> At Task <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, the value of Gas_Assist_Mult is further modified by applying a multiplier, obtained from Table 11, which is based on start-up coolant temperature:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Gas_Assist_Mult&equals;Gas_Assist_Mult&times;Table 11(Start_Up_Coolant_Temp)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> At Task <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, the value of Gas_Assist_Mult is limited to a value of 1.0.
