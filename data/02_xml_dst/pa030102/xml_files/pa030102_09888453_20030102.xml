<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a float used for a liquid waste disposal apparatus serving to absorb, to solidify and to dispose a liquid waste such as unwanted blood, other body fluids, secretion derived from a medical scene or pus or physiological sodium chloride solution used for cleansing affected areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A liquid waste (e.g. unwanted blood, other body fluids, secretion, pus, or physiological sodium chloride solution used for cleansing affected areas) derived from medical scenes, particularly at a scene of surgical operation, is collected into a container or a collecting bag for disposal and incineration by an absorbing apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, since the liquid waste may contain a harmful bacteria or the like, a secondary infection may occur among medical employees, hospital patients and the like, when the container or the collecting bag becomes damaged or when an excessive amount of the liquid waste is absorbed exceeding a capacity of the collecting bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> For preventing thus created problem, an apparatus for solidifying a liquid waste with a water-absorptive material arranged inside a collecting bag is provided and methods for arranging the liquid waste solidifying water-absorptive material inside the collecting bag are provided such as: a method of forming a collecting bag with a non-water permeable sheet and a water-absorptive sheet stuck with each other in which the water-absorptive sheet is arranged as an inner surface, a method of dropping a prepared water-absorptive material into a collecting bag after an absorption of liquid waste, or a method of fixing a water-absorptive material at a bottom portion of a collecting bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Nevertheless, the foregoing conventional example of forming a collecting bag with a non-water permeable sheet and a water-absorptive sheet stuck with each other caused an inner portion to be unable to be seen from outside and also caused difficulty of folding and also caused inconvenience during storage and transport owing to a multiple structure of the collecting bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing conventional example of dropping a prepared water-absorptive material into a collecting bag after absorption of liquid waste, further absorption could not be performed once solidification is completed and there remained a danger when toppled during the middle of a process since solidification would not proceed until the water-absorptive material is dropped inside the collecting bag. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> With the foregoing conventional example of fixing a water-absorptive material at a bottom portion of a collecting bag, a solidifying speed would decrease in association with the proceeding of the liquid waste absorption process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention to solve the aforementioned problems by providing a float for a liquid waste disposal apparatus capable of making the amount of the content inside a container more visible and capable of making solidification of an absorbed liquid waste faster and steadier. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> This invention for solving the foregoing problems relates to a float for a liquid waste disposal apparatus contained in a floatable state inside a container for containing an absorbed liquid waste comprising: a solidifying agent retaining portion for retaining a solidifying agent; a revolution prevention member restrained by an inner wall of the container to prevent revolution in a vertical direction; and a flow path for flowing downward a liquid waste absorbed from an upper portion into the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Thus structured, the flow path flows downward a liquid waste absorbed from an upper portion into the container. The revolution prevention member arranged to the float and restrained by an inner wall of the container serves to prevent the float from revolving in a vertical direction and thus enables the float to steadily float inside the container. The solidifying agent retained by the solidifying agent retaining portion serves to solidify the liquid waste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A solidifying agent could be provided within the container since the float itself is capable of retaining a solidifying agent; subsequently, the solidification of liquid waste inside the container enables the container to be disposed one by one and thus enables sanitary disposal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Structuring the revolution prevention member by forming a guide member at a sidewall of a float body or at an outer peripheral portion of the float body enables a desirable simple structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Structuring the flow path by forming an interstitial portion arranged between the sidewall of the float body and the inner wall of the container and/or an interstitial portion arranged between the float body and the guide member arranged at the outer peripheral portion of the float body enables a desirable simple structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Another structure of the float for a liquid waste disposal apparatus regarding this invention relates to a float for a liquid waste disposal apparatus contained in a floatable state inside a container for containing an absorbed liquid waste comprising: an annular solidifying agent retaining portion for retaining a solidifying agent, wherein a hollow portion of the annular solidifying agent retaining portion forms a flow path for flowing downward a liquid waste absorbed from an upper portion into the container and thus, a sidewall of the annular solidifying agent retaining portion is restrained by an inner wall of the container to prevent revolution in a vertical direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Thus structured, a flow path formed of a hollow portion of the annular solidifying agent retaining portion enables a liquid waste absorbed into the container to flow downward from an upper portion. The annular revolution prevention member restrained by an inner wall of the container serves to prevent the float from revolving in a vertical direction and thus enables the float to steadily float inside the container. The solidifying agent retained by the annular solidifying agent retaining portion serves to solidify the liquid waste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A solidifying agent could be provided inside the container since the float itself is capable of retaining a solidifying agent; subsequently, the solidification of liquid waste inside the container enables the container to be solely and sanitarily disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Another structure of the float for a liquid waste disposal apparatus regarding this invention relates to a float for a liquid waste disposal apparatus contained in a floatable state inside a container for containing an absorbed liquid waste comprising: an annular solidifying agent retaining portion for retaining a solidifying agent; and a revolution prevention member having a stick-like, or pipe-like, or wire-like structure and being inserted through the hollow portion of the annular solidifying agent retaining portion, wherein the hollow portion of the annular solidifying agent retaining portion forms a flow path for flowing downward a liquid waste absorbed from an upper portion into the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> According to thus structure, the liquid waste absorbed from an upper portion flows downward into the container via the hollow portion of the annular solidifying agent retaining portion serving as the flow path. A revolution prevention member having a stick-like, or pipe-like, or wire-like structure and being inserted through the hollow portion of the annular solidifying agent retaining portion is restrained by an inner wall of the container so as to prevent the float from revolving in a vertical direction and thus enabling the float to steadily float inside the container. The solidifying agent retained by the annular solidifying agent retaining portion serves to solidify the liquid waste. A solidifying agent could be provided within the container since the float itself is capable of retaining a solidifying agent; subsequently, the solidification of liquid waste inside the container enables the container to be solely and sanitarily disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> An activation of an absorption stop valve causes absorption to automatically stop when the float inside the container reaches an upper end portion of the container by arranging the absorption stop valve at an inner side of the upper portion of the container in which the absorption stop valve is activated when pushed upward by an upward-pushing portion; subsequently, the upward-pushing portion of the float activates the absorption stop valve so as to automatically stop the absorption of liquid waste before the container becomes full and also serves to prevent an air pump or the like from malfunctioning from an excessive absorption into the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> By forming a downward opening portion and by stretching and spreading a water permeable sheet (e.g. traditional Japanese paper) in a state where a liquid waste absorbed into the container flows downward from the upper portion via the flow path, the liquid waste could permeate into the water permeable sheet and contacts to a solidifying agent and then, the solidifying agent could swell to tear the water permeable sheet and then, the solidifying agent is mixed into the liquid waste from a downward opening portion of the solidifying agent retaining portion so as to solidify the liquid waste below the float. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> By forming a downward opening portion and by stretching and spreading a water-soluble film in a state where a liquid waste absorbed into the container flows downward from the upper portion via the flow path, the liquid waste contacts to the water-soluble sheet and dissolves the water-soluble sheet and then, the solidifyng agent is mixed into the liquid waste from a downward opening portion of the solidifying agent retaining portion so as to solidify the liquid waste below the float. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> By controlling a specific gravity of the float for a liquid waste disposal apparatus to become less than 1, a liquid surface could be easily confirmed from outside by checking the position of the float since the float would always remain afloat at a gas-liquid interface; accordingly, an amount of the absorbed liquid waste could easily be visually recognized and could also function as a level gauge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> By having at least one portion of the float for a liquid waste disposal apparatus in a florescent color or in a color distinguishable between a color of a liquid waste, a liquid surface could easily be confirmed from outside since the position of the float could easily be visually recognized; accordingly, an operator could positively confirm the used capacity as well as the remaining capacity of the container.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Structuring the revolution prevention member <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> positively prevents the float <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> from vertically revolving even when the height of the float <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is substantially short. The other structural portions are comparatively the same as that of the sixth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> The other structural portions regarding the sixth and seventh embodiments have the same structure and effect as that of the foregoing embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Although the foregoing embodiments are examples describing a float <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> contained inside the flexible lying member L, the float could be contained inside a container without a flexible structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> This invention having the aforementioned structure and effect enables the content inside a container to be easily visually recognizable and allows a faster and steadier solidification of an absorbed liquid waste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0129" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0129&rsqb;</number> According to the float for a liquid waste disposal apparatus claim 1, the liquid waste absorbed from above and into the container via the flow path flows under the float. The revolution prevention member arranged to the float and restrained by the inner wall of the container serves to prevent the float from revolving in a vertical direction and allows the float to steadily float inside the container. The solidifying agent retained by the solidifying agent retaining portion solidifies the liquid waste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0130" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0130&rsqb;</number> The container could be structured having the solidifying agent at the inner side since the float itself retains the solidifying agent; subsequently, the liquid waste could be solidified inside the container to enable the container to be solely and sanitarily disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0131" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0131&rsqb;</number> Forming the revolution prevention member by arranging the guide members at the sidewall of the float body or the outer peripheral portion of the float body enables a simple and desirable structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0132" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0132&rsqb;</number> Forming the flow path by arranging the interstitial portion formed between the sidewall of the float body and the inner wall of the container and/or the interstitial portion formed between the float body and the outer peripheral portion of the float body enables a simple and desirable structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0133" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0133&rsqb;</number> According to the float for a liquid waste disposal apparatus claim 4, the liquid waste absorbed from above and into the container via the flow path formed of the annular solidifying agent retaining portion flows under to the float. The annular solidifying agent retaining portion restrained by the inner wall of the container serves to prevent the float from revolving in a vertical direction and allows the float to steadily float inside the container. The solidifying agent retained by the annular solidifying agent retaining portion solidifies the liquid waste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0134" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0134&rsqb;</number> The container could be structured having the solidifying agent at the inner side since the float itself retains the solidifying agent; subsequently, the liquid waste could be solidified inside the container to enable the container to be solely and sanitarily disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0135" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0135&rsqb;</number> According to the float for a liquid waste disposal apparatus claim 5, the liquid waste absorbed from above and into the container via the flow path formed of the annular solidifying agent retaining portion flows under to the float. A stick-like, or pipe-like, or wire-like revolution prevention member is inserted through the hollow portion of the annular solidifying agent retaining portion for preventing the float from revolving in a vertical direction and for allowing the float to steadily float inside the container. The solidifying agent retained by the annular solidifying agent retaining portion solidifies the liquid waste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0136" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0136&rsqb;</number> The container could be structured having the solidifying agent at the inner side since the float itself retains the solidifying agent; subsequently, the liquid waste could be solidified inside the container to enable the container to be solely and sanitarily disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0137" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0137&rsqb;</number> The activation of the absorption stop valve causes the automatic cease of absorption when the float reaches an upper end portion inside the container owing to the structure where the ceiling edge surface serving as the upward-pushing portion is arranged to the float for upwardly pushing and activating the absorption stop valve arranged at the inner-upper portion of the container; the ceiling edge portion of the float activates the absorption stop valve to automatically cease the absorption of the liquid waste before the container becomes full with liquid waste; accordingly, the air-pump or the like would not malfunction due to an excessive absorption into the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0138" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0138&rsqb;</number> The solidifying agent retaining portion is open in a downward direction having the water permeable sheet (e.g. traditional Japanese paper) spread and stretched at the opening portion, and then, the liquid waste absorbed in from the upper portion of the container flows under the float via the flow path so as to permeate through the water permeable sheet and contact the water-absorptive material, and then, the water-absorptive material swells to tear the water permeable sheet, and then the water-absorptive material is mixed into the liquid waste from the opening formed at the lower portion of the cup portion for solidifying the liquid waste under the float. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0139" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0139&rsqb;</number> The float could always remain afloat at the liquid-gas interface by structuring the float to have a specific gravity less than 1; accordingly, the position of a liquid-level could easily be confirmed from outside by confirming the position of the float, and further, the amount of the absorbed liquid waste could easily be visually recognized so that the float could also function as a level gauge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0140" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0140&rsqb;</number> By forming at least one portion of the float into a florescent color or a color distinguishable from the liquid waste, the position of the float could easily be visually recognized from outside so that the liquid-surface could easily be recognized and thus, the operator could positively confirm the used state and the remaining capacity of the container. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0141" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0141&rsqb;</number> The foregoing description of a preferred embodiment of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration and description, and is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed.
