<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention relates to a rope type folding mechanism for an exercise treadmill. Each end of the U-shaped handrail is provided with a rope wheel whose shaft is pivotably mounted on the extension part at the top of each of the supporting arms. Thereafter, a strong rope is fixed at one side of the rope wheel and pulled downward to the bottom of the frame. When the U-shaped handrail is raised and turned around the shaft, the rope wheel is also rotated to pull the strong rope upward. Thereafter, the frame is raised up to the top by means that the rear roller is turned around the first pivot. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a rope type folding mechanism for an exercise treadmill, and more particularly, an exercise treadmill whose frame can be folded or unfolded by moving the handrail. Therefore, the convenience in use is achieved and the safety is ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The frame of the conventional treadmills (for example, the disclosed U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,674,453, and 6,033,347) is designed to be foldable in order to reduce the occupied space and to facilitate the movement thereof. However, these products have to include an auxiliary lifting member (like pneumatic or oil-pressurized cylinder) behind the frame in order to prevent the frame from an unexpected collapse endangering the operator or the other around. Accordingly, the whole design and use show much inconvenience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Moreover, this conventional design doesn&apos;t fit the old or the disable in waist or lower limbs because they have much difficulty in bending down to perform the folding movement. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is a primary object of the present invention to remove the above-mentioned drawbacks and to provide a folding mechanism for an exercise treadmill through which the operator doesn&apos;t need to bend down to perform the folding movement of the frame. Furthermore, the frame can be folded to the top at an automatic locking position by means of rope wheels, strong ropes and corresponding pivots for achieving a full safety for operators and people around.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> First of all, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a preferred embodiment of the present invention mainly includes a U-shaped handrail <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, two supporting arms <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a front support <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a motorized assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a rear treading plate <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a platform <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> the front and rear ends of which are fitted with a front and rear rollers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> between which a treadmill walking belt <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> circles. Besides, the rear roller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is positioned on horizontal parts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the supporting arms <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by means of a first pivot <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The motorized assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> comprises a motor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, a belt <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a driven wheel <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and a protection cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The motor <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is fixed behind the horizontal parts <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the supporting arms <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by means of a fastening member. The belt <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extend between a power output shaft <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the driven wheel <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> while the rear roller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is driven by the driven wheel <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> for a rotational movement of the treadmill walking belt <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Each end of the U-shaped handrail <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with a rope wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> whose shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is pivotably mounted on the extension part <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at the top of each of the supporting arms <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, a strong rope <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is fixed at one side of the rope wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and pulled downward to the bottom <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. When the U-shaped handrail <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is raised and turned around the shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the rope wheel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is also rotated to pull the strong rope <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> upward. Thereafter, the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is raised up to the top by means that the rear roller <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is turned around the first pivot <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Based on the above-mentioned components, the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be folded up for storage or unfolded for exercise operation only by moving the U-shaped handrail <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile, when the U-shaped handrail <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is moved up to the top (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), the handrail <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is considerably turned to the other side of the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a hung state at a locked angle. Therefore, the frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> won&apos;t be unexpectedly collapsed even in case of being moved. The frame <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can only be lowered by moving the U-shaped handrail <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in proper operation steps so that the safety is more ensured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In order to facilitate the movement of the strong rope <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, a plurality of locating rolls <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> are disposed on the supporting arms <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This belongs to prior art so that further descriptions won&apos;t be given. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Many changes and modifications in the above-described embodiment of the invention can, of course, be carried out without departing from the scope thereof. Accordingly, to promote the progress in science and the useful arts, the invention is disclosed and is intended to be limited only by the scope of the appended claim. </paragraph>
