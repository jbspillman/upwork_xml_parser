<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention features a novel design for a fiducial and pin one indicator that utilizes a single solder resist opening in a die mounting substrate to perform the combined functions of prior art fiducials and pin one indicators. Methods of fabricating a carrier substrate and fabricating a semiconductor device package using the combination pin one indicator and alignment fiducial of the present invention are also provided. Preferably, the pin one indicator/alignment fiducial is placed adjacent a corner area of a ball grid array, and comprises an &ldquo;L&rdquo;-shaped narrow opening in a solder mask layer in which two lines, mutually perpendicular to one another, form components of an X-Y axis. The pin one indicator/alignment fiducial of the present invention is configured to provide only a minimal opening in the solder resist, making smaller pitches between solder balls and tighter dimensional controls possible. Therefore, the present invention is particularly useful for packages in which the solder resist surface of the mounting substrate is heavily populated with solder ball contact pads and/or and solder balls, and/or in applications where the chip outline is nearly the same size as the package (e.g., Chip Scale Packages (CSP), Near Chip Size (NCS), etc.). </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to ball grid array packages. More specifically, this invention relates to a method of using a single solder resist opening on a ball grid array substrate as both a saw fiducial and a pin one indicator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. State of the Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Integrated circuits (ICs) are typically fabricated on a semiconductor wafer. To achieve the many semiconductor devices which may be formed thereon, the semiconductive wafer is subjected to deposition, etching, planarization and lithographic processes. The wafer then cut or &ldquo;diced&rdquo; to form multiple semiconductor die (dice) or semiconductor devices (IC chips). Typically, these individual semiconductor devices are transferred to a mounting substrate an automatic &ldquo;pick and place&rdquo; process. Thereafter, a semiconductor device is electrically connected to the substrate and encapsulated by a molding apparatus into a final package. As trends continue towards higher performance, high input/output, and high board-manufacturing-yield continue, Ball Grid Array (BGA) packaging has become the technology of choice. In an ever increasing number of semiconductor applications, therefore, semiconductor devices or IC chips are mounted onto printed circuit boards or other mounting substrates which utilize BGA packaging methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Currently some types of BGA packages, including fine pitch ball grid array (FPBGA) and micro ball grid array (&mgr;BGA) semiconductor device packages, are known in the art. The various types of BGA packages that have been developed include BGAs mounted on printed wiring boards, leadframes, and flexible tape. Presently, due to the need for smaller devices having a higher lead count and a smaller footprint, BGAs are used in chip scale packaging with increasing frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One type of BGA package, known as &ldquo;board-on-chip,&rdquo; is shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. A board-on-chip BGA package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> typically comprises a substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having an upper surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, an opposing bottom surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and an elongated aperture <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> extending through the middle thereof. Substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is typically a polymer laminate printed circuit board, although ceramics, and other types of substrates may be used. During a die attach process, a semiconductor die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is mounted on the bottom surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using an adhesive, adhesive and tape and/or adhesively coated tape, having active surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> upwardly facing and positioned below aperture <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Active surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is configured having a plurality of bond pads <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in single or multiple columns thereon which are substantially aligned with aperture <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as illustrated therein. As illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, bond pads <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be viewed through aperture <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as they are substantially aligned. Upper surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a conductor surface wherein circuit traces <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are formed, typically by etching, in a desired pattern. Alternatively, circuit traces <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are formed on the semiconductor device side of substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or are formed internally within substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Circuit traces <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> are interconnected with a plurality of bond pads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and an array of contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> located along the periphery of aperture <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, and extending from circuit traces <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, respectively. Bond pads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are generally located at separate terminal ends of circuit traces <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, as can be seen in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are formed in arrays of varying numbers, dependent upon the specific application of the package. Each contact pad <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> typically comprises a solderable surface mount pad which is formed of a conductive metal, such as copper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> As shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a laminated or screen printed solder resist layer, or solder mask <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Solder mask <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed over top and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and comprises an electrically insulating, low surface tension material which shields conductive members on top and bottom surfaces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, respectively, from subsequent soldering and/or plating operations that might result in electrical shorts. The layer of solder resist comprising solder mask <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> initially covers all portions of surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (including bond pads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>), with the exception of a semiconductor device receiving area of the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In a subsequent step, a pattern of via openings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are created in solder mask <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, via openings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> corresponding to portions of bond pads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to which conductive elements, such as conductive wires <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and solder balls <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, are respectively attached. To mask the areas over bond pads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, solder mask layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> must obviously be at least deposited in a thickness at least minimally thicker than the height of bond pads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Typically, the solder mask used to cover substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a photoimageable material that can be blanket deposited as a wet or dry film. By using photolithographic processes, vias <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of predetermined diameters are formed by exposing and developing a desired pattern on the resist areas through a photoimaging mask, resulting in the removal of resist material and the exposure of bond pads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Through a wire bonding process, conductive wires <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> extend from bond pads <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through aperture <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to contact pads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> located in the wirebonding area on terminal end portions of circuit traces <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> on or within substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Conductive wires <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> serve to electrically connect the bond pads <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to contact pads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In turn, contact pads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> by circuit traces <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are then placed in contact with respective electrically conductive, connective elements such as solder balls <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, solder balls <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are placed directly upon, or in electrical communication with, the termination point of a selected circuit trace <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Solder balls <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are typically gold filled, although other conductive metal-based solder balls or conductive filled epoxy materials are frequently used. As illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, conductive wires <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, die bond pads <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and contact pads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are shown covered with a layer of protective encapsulant <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. An encapsulant layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is also shown covering the inactive backside surface of semiconductor die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and bottom surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Bond pad geometries are typically formed as a standard round shape. Because of the excellent self-centering property of solder ball interconnections, BGA applications have significantly greater misalignment tolerances than other interconnection techniques, such as quad flatpack leads for example. As such, relatively wide variations in solder ball placement are accommodated during reflow of the solder joints. Generally, the rule of thumb is that solder balls must have a radial placement accuracy wherein the solder is at least &ldquo;half on pad.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Generally, the types of bond pad layouts presently known in the art are Solder Mask Defined bond pad layouts and Non-Solder Mask Defined bond pad layouts. In Solder Mask Defined layouts of bond pads, the opening in the solder resist defining the solder ball mounting area is made smaller than the copper, or any suitable type metal, bond pad disposed underneath. Thus, the solder mask overlaps with the edge of the copper pad. This arrangement carries with it the advantage of providing better copper pad definition, since Solder Mask Defined layouts of bond pads are located by photo-imaging, rather than by copper etching as is the case for Non-Solder Mask Defined pads. Given the smaller vias allowed by the use of Solder Mask Defined layouts for bond pads, tighter tolerances and spacings between solder balls are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In contrast, bond pads which are formed by Non-Solder Mask Defined layouts of bond pads have a solder mask opening which is larger than the copper pad, or any suitable type metal pad. In this situation, the size of the copper defines the size of the pad, and the size of the pad is determined by a copper etching process. Non-Solder Mask Defined layouts of bond pads are considered less accurate that those determined by solder mask photo-imaging processes, but offer advantages in that vision system registration of copper fiducials give an exact location of the site, whereas any mis-registration error in regards to photo-imaging the Solder Mask Defined layouts of pads will shift the location of the entire site relative to the vision fiducials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Referring again to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, to bond the solder balls to contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, flux is typically applied to contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> or to solder balls <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and/or to both. Solder balls <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are then placed in the via openings <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> over contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and the solder is reflowed into a metallurgical solder bond. During the reflow process, the vias <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in solder mask layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> aide in positioning solder balls <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can be arranged in a grid array pattern wherein the conductive elements, or solder balls, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, of a preselected size, or sizes, are spaced away from each at one or more preselected distances, or pitches. Typically, solder ball sizes can be approximately 0.6 mm or less, and the solder balls may have a spacing, or pitch, of approximately 0.80 mm or less. When using tape substrates, high package densities with pitches approaching 0.05 mm are possible. In BGA arrangements using Plated Thru Hole (PTH) technology, consideration must be given to the placement of the bond pad. Bone pads which are placed too closely to a hole run the risk of solder melting and flowing into the hole, the wicking of the solder potentially creating a situation where the solder does not wet the entire bond pad, thus creating an &ldquo;open&rdquo; for that lead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In packages using FPBGA or &mgr;BGA patterns, contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are spaced at very small distances from each other, resulting in dimensionally small spacings or pitches for relatively small conductive elements, or solder balls, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> placed thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a top view of a portion of a BGA substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> containing an unencapsulated BGA package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, prior to singulation of BGA substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. BGA substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown incorporating the use of a prior art alignment mark or fiducial <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a pin one indicator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Used for accurate automated assembly, alignment marks or fiducials <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and pin one indicator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are typically incorporated on upper surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Alignment marks or fiducials <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, for example, ensure that substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is properly aligned and positioned for the automated mounting of a semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, marks for this purpose are generally found aligned with the lateral edges and the center axis of the substrate area in which semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is to be attached. Alignment marks or fiducials <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, when set in &ldquo;street lines,&rdquo; may also be used for aligning a saw or other severing equipment to be used for the singulation or separation of BGA packages. Generally, alignment marks or fiducials <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for the alignment of singulation or severing equipment are disposed on a peripheral area of substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; the peripheral area typically used as a clamping area during the encapsulation of semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and its related interconnections within BGA package <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Pin one indicator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is used by automated die attach apparatus to orient semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the proper configuration. Pin one indicator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is generally positioned in close proximity to the semiconductor device mounting site in an area of the solder resist not occupied by contact pads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, or circuit traces <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Typically, pin one indicator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and alignment marks or fiducials <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are formed as openings in the solder resist <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (see drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), allowing an underlying conductive feature (e.g., Cu, Au, Ni, etc.) to show through. Thus, the conductive feature showing through typically comprises the same metal as that of the conductors (i.e., contact pads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, contact pads <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and circuit traces <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>) formed over the substrate surface. Methods for forming the pin one indicator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and fiducial marks <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> include exposure by photo-lithographic processes and the use of lasers. The shape of pin one indicators <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and alignment marks or fiducials <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are known to vary in the art. As shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> standard design for a pin one indicator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is a triangularly shaped opening in the solder resist, while a standard design for an alignment mark or fiducial <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is typically formed from openings in the solder resist fashioned as an X-Y axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Generally, automated die attachment apparatus use a vision system to locate a fiducial <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and/or pin one indicator feature <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, on a substrate. By detecting the position of the fiducial <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and pin one indicator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the position and orientation of substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be accurately detected. Fiducials and pin one indicators (not shown), such as fiducials <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and pin one indicators <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, can also typically be found on semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for orienting the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> during the automated pick and place process. The vision system uses the semiconductor device fiducials and substrate fiducials <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and pin one indicators <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to check semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> position on the pickup tool, and then drives the die attach apparatus to adjust the die tool and substrate position for accurate semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> placement. A relatively simple system of vision recognition is the black and white digital recognition system (DRS). For a higher degree of sophistication in recognition, a pattern recognition system (PRS) can be used as a vision system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Typically, the vision system reads the pin one indicator on the solder resist by scanning for contrasts and adjusting the backlighting to achieve the proper reflection. Using an X-Y table for proper alignment, the vision system checks the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> position on the die pickup tool, and directs the die machine to adjust the substrate and die tool into the correct positions, using X, Y, and <highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> (theta) directions, for precise semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> placement. Typically, semiconductor dice are presented to a bonding machine in wafers which may be mounted on tape on metal frames. For some die bonding machines, semiconductor dice may also be presented in gel or waffle packs. In the die bonding process, semiconductor dice are selectively picked from those of wafers respectively probe-tested in their manufacturing process using various testing equipment. Meanwhile, a mounting substrate has been indexed to the die attach site where a precise amount of adhesive, such as epoxy resin, is applied. The picked-up semiconductor device is then bonded to the die attach site of the mounting substrate via the adhesive. After the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has been adhesively mounted to the mounting substrate, a wire bonding process can take place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Still referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an accurate placement of semiconductor die <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is critical for good wire bonding. Therefore, separate pin one indicators <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and/or alignment marks or fiducials <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> must be used for each semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in each multi-device bonding area on a substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For wire bonding, sophisticated vision systems are required to accurately and reliably position the vast numbers of wire bonds to be made in a package manufacturing operation. Furthermore, the accuracy of placement of a ball bond is particularly critical if using fine-pitch wire bonding technology. Therefore, PRS vision systems in combination with alignment marks or fiducials <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are typically used. During the wirebonding process, a substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is moved and indexed from bonding site to bonding site through a clamping apparatus which retains the substrate at sequential bonding sites for producing a plurality of wire-bonded semiconductor devices. In this process, guide holes <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may be used for coarse alignment, while alignment marks or fiducials <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are typically used to aid in precise alignment. In this process, the alignment marks or fiducials <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may be separately formed from other alignment marks or fiducials which may be used for e.g., die attach or saw singulation. Conductive wires <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> extending from bond pads <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the active surface <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a semiconductor chip are then bonded to contact pads <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> surrounding aperture. Several choices may be made in the particular wire bonding process to be used. The selection of the proper wire bonding process is generally based on the pad pitch, device characteristics, and throughput requirements. Typically, either thermosonic ball bonding or ultrasonic wedge bonding are used. While thermosonic gold ball wire bonding is used for the majority of fine-pitch wire bonding, ultrasonic gold or aluminum wedge wire bonding are used for pad pitches below 60 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Subsequent to wire bonding, semiconductor device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and its related electrical interconnections are subjected to a molding process where they are encapsulated to protect them from the outside environment. Typically, encapsulation entails positioning substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on a lower mold platen such that the portions to be encapsulated are in registration with multiple mold cavities formed in the lower mold platen. The mold is then closed when the upper platen, also containing a mold cavity, is lowered onto lower platen. When the mold is closed, a peripheral portion of substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, usually containing fiducials or alignment marks <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, are typically compressed between the upper and lower platens to seal the mold cavities in order to prevent leakage of liquified plastic molding compound. After wire bonding, individual or groups of packages are separated from one another by a cutting process, typically making use of alignment marks or fiducials <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for the positioning of the singulation equipment to allow cutting along a package edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Several disadvantages are known in the art with regard to the use of conventional pin one indicators <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and alignment marks or fiducials <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. First, while pin one indicators <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and fiducial marks <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are completely unnecessary for the operating characteristics of the completed BGA package, their presence disadvantageously takes up valuable real estate on substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This is problematic since the trend in industry today is towards smaller, yet denser packages. Foreseeably, higher density ball grid arrays will be used which will be populated so as to encroach on the package edge, resulting in smaller array pitches and tighter dimensional controls. For example, industry is increasingly moving to towards widespread use of the &ldquo;chip scale package,&rdquo; in which the footprint of the package is only approximately twenty percent or less larger than that of the semiconductor device. Therefore, as BGA packages shrink and as density increases, it is desirable to make pin one indicators <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and fiducials <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> as small as possible. Furthermore, large pin one indicator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and fiducial <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> openings in the solder resist can interfere with the operation of defect scanning visions systems. Finally, saw fiducials are typically placed in the encapsulation clamping areas where the non-planar solder resist surface that forms the fiducial can lead to resin bleed or flashing over the bond pads or contact pads during the molding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, what is needed in the art are pin one indicators and fiducials which reduce the size of solder resist openings, thereby taking up a minimal amount of space and maintaining a substantially planar solder resist substrate surface. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The present invention features a novel design for a fiducial and pin one indicator that utilizes a single solder resist opening in a die mounting substrate to perform the combined functions of prior art fiducials and pin one indicators. Methods of fabricating a carrier substrate and fabricating a semiconductor device package using the combination pin one indicator and alignment fiducial of the present invention are also provided. Preferably, the pin one indicator/alignment fiducial comprises an &ldquo;L&rdquo;-shaped narrow opening in the solder mask layer in which two lines, substantially mutually perpendicular to one another, form components of an X-Y axis. In one embodiment, the combination pin one indicator/alignment fiducial is placed relatively closely adjacent (as compared to prior art pin one indicators and fiducials) an array of contact pads on a mounting substrate configured for receiving a semiconductor device. Preferably, the contact pads are arranged in a dense array for forming a fine pitch ball grid array (FPBGA)or &mgr;BGA. The distinctive configuration of the combination fiducial/pin one indicator is recognized by a vision system and allows for precise orientation and alignment of a semiconductor device during die attach. The combination pin one indicator/alignment fiducial may also be used for alignment in wire bonding, and as an alignment fiducial for a singulation saw or other substrate severing apparatus employed to separate individual semiconductor device packages from a substrate array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the pin one indicator/alignment fiducial of the present invention is solder mask-defined by use of a laser to produce a highly defined and accurate mark. Photo-imaging processes known in the art may also be used to define the pin one indicator/alignment fiducial. Conventional photo-imaging methods may further be combined with stereo-lithographic processes to tighten solder mask exposure around the pin one indicator/alignment fiducial and the contact pads of a ball grid array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The pin one indicator/alignment fiducial of the present invention further provides only a minimal opening in the solder resist, thus allowing for smaller pitches between solder balls, and tighter dimensional controls. Therefore, the present invention is particularly useful for packages in which the solder resist surface of the mounting substrate is heavily populated with contact pads and/or and solder balls, and/or in applications where the semiconductor device outline is nearly the same size as the package (e.g., Chip Scale Packages (CSP), Near Chip Size (NCS), etc., ). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those of skill in the art through a consideration of the ensuing description, the accompanying drawings, and the appended claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A combination pin one indicator and alignment fiducial for automated die attach processes and substrate singulation is disclosed. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art that the specific detail need not be employed in order to practice the present invention. In other instances, well known materials or methods have not been described in detail in order to avoid obscuring the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The present invention features a novel design for a pin one indicator and alignment fiducial that utilizes a single solder resist (also referred to herein as &ldquo;solder mask&rdquo;) opening in a die mounting substrate (also referred to herein as a &ldquo;carrier substrate&rdquo;) to perform the combined functions of prior art alignment fiducials and pin one indicators. The present invention further includes a carrier substrate configured with the combination pin one indicator and alignment fiducial, as well as methods of fabricating a semiconductor device package and a semiconductor carrier substrate using the novel combination pin one indicator and alignment fiducial. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term &ldquo;combination pin one indicator and alignment fiducial&rdquo; (also referred to herein as a &ldquo;pin one indicator/alignment fiducial&rdquo;) generally refers to a mark in a solder mask surface associated with each die attach site of a mounting substrate, and which is configured with at least one axis suitable for both alignment of a semiconductor device during semiconductor die attach, and alignment of a singulation saw or other severing apparatus during singulation of a package from a mounting substrate. The combination pin one indicator and fiducial may also be used for alignment of a mounting substrate and wire bonding or lead bonding apparatus during wire bonding or lead bonding operations. The term &ldquo;combination pin one indicator and alignment fiducial&rdquo; will be further clarified when considering the embodiments disclosed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the combination pin one indicator/alignment fiducial is provided as disposed proximate a BGA of a mounting substrate. Preferably, the combination pin one indicator/alignment fiducial will be disposed adjacent a BGA of a substrate surface configured for forming a chip scale or other relatively densely populated package known in the art. The distinctive configuration of the combination pin one indicator/alignment fiducial can be recognized by a vision system, and allows for precise alignment of a semiconductor device during die attach. The combination pin one indicator/alignment fiducial may also be used as a saw fiducial for a singulation saw employed to separate individual packages on a substrate array. In a preferred embodiment, the pin one indicator/alignment fiducial of the present invention is solder mask-defined by use of a laser to produce a highly defined and accurate mark. One of skill in the art will recognize that various laser are available for this purpose, including YAG lasers, excimer lasers, and carbon dioxide lasers. Photo-imaging processes known in the art may also be used to define the pin one indicator/alignment fiducial. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, illustrated is a top view of a simplified BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is shown. BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a first surface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and an opposing second surface (not shown). Although only first surface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is shown, it is understood by one of skill in the art that the second surface of BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may contain additional circuitry, such as conductors, and/or additional devices. As used herein, the term &ldquo;conductors&rdquo; refers to conductive metal placed on a mounting substrate surface. Thus, &ldquo;conductors&rdquo; may refer to contact pads, circuit traces, and any other type conductive metal regions, pads or areas provided on a mounting substrate. On the first surface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, shown as the upper surface of BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, an array of semiconductor device receiving sites <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> for the mounting of a semiconductor device is provided. Surrounding each of the semiconductor device receiving sites <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are connective elements forming a ball grid array <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the ball grid array <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> being formed of a plurality of connective elements for electrically connecting a completed semiconductor device package to an external component, such as a module board or a second BGA semiconductor device package. The connective elements of each ball grid array <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> comprise contact pads (not shown) with solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> disposed thereon. Although solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are not typically placed on contact pads until after a die attach and encapsulation process, solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are included for ease of illustrating a representative BGA substrate. As can be seen in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the connective elements are arranged in a preselected grid array pattern. On a corner perimeter region adjacent each BGA <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in the substrate array, and in the corner associated with pin one placement for a semiconductor device to be placed on a semiconductor device receiving site <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, a pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> configured in accordance with the principles of the present invention is shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Preferably, pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> comprises an &ldquo;L&rdquo;-shaped and narrow opening in the solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in which two lines, substantially mutually perpendicular to one another, form components of a X-Y axis. The &ldquo;L&rdquo; shape of pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be inverted and/or spatially rotated to serve the purposes of the present invention. Illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> is an example of the preferred configuration for pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Of the substantially mutually perpendicular lines, the aspect of the solder mask opening extending along the X axis is used for substrate position detection and alignment in the X direction, while the aspect of the solder mask opening extending along the Y axis is used for substrate position detection and alignment in the Y direction. Pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is shown placed closely adjacent the array of solder mask-defined contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. A conductor pad <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>, over which pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is formed, is shown in outline form underlying solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, thus illustrated a preferred embodiment in which pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is solder mask-defined. Circuit traces <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are shown in electrical contact with contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> at one end, and are extending towards contact pads <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (not shown) at an opposing end in furtherance of an electrical circuit. Contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> are also illustrated as solder mask-defined, with the portion of each contact pad <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> underlying solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> represented in outline form. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As can best be seen in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the location of pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can correspond to one or more exposed features on a carrier substrate. For example, one or more edge portions of pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be aligned with an axis of a conductive element and/or an edge of a semiconductor device to further enhance alignment capabilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the distinctive shape of pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be easily read by a vision system for proper orientation and alignment during die attach, the relatively narrow openings in the solder mask layer which form pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> serve to maximize the amount of real estate which can be used for substrate interconnections or other circuitry, such as for a densely populated BGA. The minimal opening in the solder mask layer further provides a more planar surface during clamping in the molding process, thus reducing resin bleed and flashing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Additionally, pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be used to align a singulation saw or other substrate severing apparatus during singulation of individual semiconductor device packages. For example, a singulation saw can cut along one or both of the X or Y aspects of pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> wherein the X or Y aspects will form, or be closely associated with, package edges of an individual semiconductor device package. Thus, the placement of the solder mask-defined pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in close proximity to the array of contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and circuit traces <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> allows for a saw edge to be aligned with relatively tight tolerances to the solder mask openings around contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. In addition to maximizing the amount of real estate used per semiconductor device package, one of skill in the art will recognize that tight tolerances at the edge of a semiconductor device package are important for various electronic testing applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> It will be understood by one of skill in the art that pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is not limited to the &ldquo;L&rdquo; shape described, but rather that the critical factor in the configuration of pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is that it allows for accurate alignment and orientation processes while providing only a minimal opening in the solder resist. Therefore, one of skill in the art will recognize that the pin one indicator/alignment fiducial of the present invention may be configured in a variety of other shapes which provide suitably minimal openings in the solder resist while still performing the combined functions of a pin one indicator and an alignment fiducial. Examples of geometrically different combination pin one indicator and alignment fiducials are illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B and 5C</cross-reference>. These embodiments include a third axis, &thgr;, extending in a substantially forty-five degree (45&deg;) angle from a point of intersection between the X and Y axises. Furthermore, while the combination pin one indicator and alignment fiducial of the present invention is preferably formed as a contiguous mark, recess or other opening in the solder mask layer, the combination pin one indicator and alignment fiducial may be formed of a combination closely spaced marks, recesses or other openings in the solder resist grouped in such close proximity so as to be considered a single alignment feature, albeit serving multiple functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the present invention is configured to provide only a minimal opening in the solder resist, smaller pitches between solder balls and tighter dimensional controls are possible. Therefore, the present invention is particularly useful for packages in which the solder resist surface of the mounting substrate is heavily populated with contact pads and/or and solder balls, and in applications where the semiconductor device outline is nearly the same size as the singulated semiconductor device package (e.g., Chip Scale Packages (CSP), Near Chip Size Packages (NCS), etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> One of skill in the art will recognize that pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has widespread applicability in the art of semiconductor packaging. In addition to the various types of ball grid arrays (FBGA, &mgr;BGA, low profile fine-pitch ball grid array (LPFPBGA) etc.) known in the art to be used for external interconnection of the chip package to e.g., printed wiring boards, other IC chip packages, multi-chip modules, etc., the pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the present invention is useful for the construction of chip packages incorporating numerous other types of external interconnection arrays, such as pin connectors or wire bonds for example. Pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be used in packages utilizing a myriad of surface mount configurations, such as flip-chip, quad flatpack (QFP), etc., as well as chip packages designed for multi-chip stacking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring again to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> generally comprises an electrically insulating material. In one embodiment, BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> comprises a polymer laminate circuit board. BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may also be formed of a variety of other materials, however, including, but not limited to ceramics, metal (including metal leadframes), plastics, various organics, or combinations thereof, etc.. BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be formed with or without cavities or recessed areas as the die receiving areas <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. BGA array substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may also be formed with a plurality of apertures therethrough to allow for construction of a board-on-chip array as previously described, and as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be configured with one or more die receiving areas <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> formed on either the first surface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> or the opposing second surface of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Methods of fabricating a carrier substrate and fabricating a semiconductor device package using the combination pin one indicator and alignment fiducial of the present invention will now be explained in more detail. Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> simplified diagram of a portion of BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is shown with a plurality of conductors (pad <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, circuit traces <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, contact pads <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>) formed on the surface of the substrate prior to the deposition of a solder mask layer. Some of the conductors (contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>) are provided in a preselected grid array pattern. Although the following steps will be described on a single substrate portion, in actual practice the steps would be carried out on a plurality of substrate arrays configured for mounting a plurality of semiconductor dice. The conductors, which will underlie an insulating layer of solder mask, are formed adjacent a semiconductor device receiving area <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and initially comprise a conductive metal which has been blanket deposited onto BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by, for example, electroless or electrolytic plating. Subsequent to deposition of the metal layer, the conductors may be defined, for example, by an etching process. The required pattern of the conductors may also be formed by other methods known in the art, such as by electroless plating through a patterned mask. The conductors may comprise pad circuit traces <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, contact pads <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. Circuit traces <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> serve to provide an electrical connection between a respective plurality of contact pads <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. For substrates densely populated with conductors, circuit traces <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> are typically 8 mils wide or less. The conductors are preferably comprised of copper or aluminum, but may be comprised of any other electrically conductive materials known in the art, such as titanium, tungsten, gold, etc.. Also shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is an additional conductor segment formed as a small area of conductive metal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which has been etched or plated closely adjacent the patterned conductors. In one embodiment, the small region of conductive metal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>will serve as a feature underlying a solder mask opening that defines the pin one/fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the present invention. Alternatively, a solder ball contact pad <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, or other conductor formed in a pattern of conductors on BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, may serve as an underlying feature of pin one indicator/fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A, a</cross-reference> layer of solder mask material <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> has been formed over first (upper) surface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> so as to cover each of the conductors <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> (e.g., circuit traces, bond pads, solder ball contact pads, or other conductive pads). A solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may also be formed over the second (bottom) surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, dependent upon the presence or proximity of conductors or other circuitry thereon. Solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is initially formed as a planar coat over substantially all portions of first surface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and bottom surface <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may alternatively be applied to cover all portions of first surface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> except for the semiconductor device receiving area <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be laminated, screen printed, sputtered, deposited by chemical vapor deposition, or otherwise formed by any means known in the art. Solder mask <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is disposed over conductors <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in a thickness and composition that shields conductors <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> on the first surface <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> from electrical shorts that might result, for example, from subsequent soldering or plating operations. Preferably, the thickness solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is deposited in a thickness sufficient to cover each of bond pads <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, such that solder mask-defined pads, as previously described, can be formed through vias in the solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. A representative thickness of a solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> typically suitable for use in the present invention is from about 1 to about 4 mils. Preferably, a photoimageable dielectric material is used as the solder mask material. Solder mask materials are commercially available for this purpose. Solder mask materials found under the tradenames &ldquo;PSR-4000,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Au55,&rdquo; manufactured by Taiyo America, Inc., Carson City, Nev., are two such suitable solder mask materials. Materials that can be ablated by a laser without blistering or bubbling are also preferred. A solder mask material comprised of polytetrafluoroethylene (PFTE) is one material suitable for use with a laser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Following deposition of solder mask layers <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the photoimageable mask materials may be partially hardened at an elevated temperature (such as 95&deg; C.) by a prebaking step, then exposed in a desired pattern by using UV light and a suitable mask. As a representative desired pattern, a mask for exposing solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may expose and develop solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> such that openings or vias are formed in the solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> that expose contact pads <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, fiducial/pin one indicator <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and die receiving sites <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, as is shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the photoimaged openings in solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> over contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are made smaller than the copper or conductive metal regions disposed underneath, making contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> solder mask-defined. In this embodiment, as is shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>C, an area of solder mask preferably overlaps with the edges of the copper contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and the additional conductor segment formed as a small area of conductive metal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. A representative overlap for a 23 mil pad diameter would be about 4 mils. In a further embodiment, a solder mask-defined opening defining pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be made by placing a mask or stencil over BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and in registration with either small region of conductive metal <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a contact pad <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, or other conductive feature underlying solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, then irradiating laser light through the opening. In a most preferred embodiment, a stereo-lithographic process, using a computerized 3D image of the desired solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> surface in combination with a laser beam to solidify photosensitive polymer liquid in the desired structure, can be used to tighten solder mask exposure in forming the contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Stereo-lithography can be used instead of, or preferably in addition to, conventional photo-imaging techniques or other techniques to form the solder mask surface and openings of solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Following formation of solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and the various contact pad <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, contact pad <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and die receiving area <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> openings therethrough, a process of die attach is conducted. Reference is made to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> as representative of a BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> prepared for a die attach process. Illustrated in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</cross-reference> is an attached semiconductor device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In die attach, a die bonder&apos;s vision system determines die placement and precise adhesive dispense by locating the distinctive configuration of pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, dispensing a precise amount of adhesive onto the correct location on semiconductor device receiving area <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, orienting a semiconductor die according the pin one mounting area as shown by the location of pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, then driving the die bonding machine to adjust the substrate and die tool position for accurate placement and mounting of the semiconductor die. For some vision system apparatus, the backlighting may be adjusted to obtain an optimum reflective contrast between pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the surrounding area of BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Due to the minimal opening in the solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> afforded by pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, a sophisticated vision system, such as PRS, is preferred for recognition of pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>D, after attaching a die <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, conductive wires <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can be wire bonded to contact pads <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and to corresponding bond pads <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of semiconductor device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In this process, the vision system of a conventional wire bonding machine may utilize pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for alignment purposes. The pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the present invention may also be used for alignment in a leadbonding process for mounted chips using leads, instead of wires, for interconnection with corresponding leads of a substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>E, the wire interconnections (comprising conductive wires <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> contact pads <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and corresponding bond pads <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of semiconductor device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>) and semiconductor device <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are encapsulated by, for example, molding compound <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> dispensed during transfer molding encapsulation process. Due to the minimal opening in solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> afforded by pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, a more planar surface is created in the clamping area of BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, thus reducing the chances of resin bleed and flashing during the molding process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Referring to drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>F, following an encapsulation process, solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be bonded to contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> by, for example, the deposition of a solder flux on solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> in combination with a solder reflow process. The solder mask-defined openings over contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> facilitate alignment of solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, protect against solder ball <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> movement in direction of an associated circuit trace <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, and insulate solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> from other conductors underlying solder mask layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The addition of solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> completes an individual BGA chip package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> To singulate an individual chip package from BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be used in the alignment of a singulation saw. In this regard, a vision system recognizes pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and directs a singulation saw to cut along BGA substrate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> according to predetermined instructions associated with the X-Y axis of pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. In a related embodiment, the singulation saw may cut along one or both of the X or Y aspects of pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> wherein the X or Y aspects will form, or be closely associated with, package edges of an individual package. This embodiment allows for relatively tight tolerances of the package edges relative to solder balls <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> placed on contact pads <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> As previously discussed, the pin one indicator/alignment fiducial of the present invention is most preferably used in association with chip scale packages, near chip scale packages, or other packages having dense arrays of conductors and interconnections. In drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is shown forming a package edge of a BGA substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, wherein BGA substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is representative of a carrier substrate having at least one chip scale package formed thereon. As used herein, a &ldquo;chip scale package&rdquo; is defined as surface mountable chip package which is no more than 1.2 times the area of the original semiconductor device size. As referred to herein, a near chip scale package is one in which the package size is relatively slightly larger than 1.2 times the original semiconductor device size. Pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is shown placed on a perimeter region outside of solder balls <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and solder mask-defined contact pads (not shown). Solder balls <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> are shown disposed on respective contact pads located to form a ball grid array <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The location of pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> further corresponds to a corner of BGA substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> outside of the ball grid array <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> in closest proximity to the pin one mounting area for the pin one (not shown) of a semiconductor die <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The positioning of pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> can be further said to correspond to a package edge <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> of a severable portion of BGA substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. As referred to herein, a &ldquo;package edge&rdquo; means an edge of a semiconductor device package which is formed, or which can be formed, by severing a severable portion of a carrier substrate. Package edge <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> is shown in outline form, since the semiconductor device package has yet to be severed from BGA substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, a singulation saw can be aligned with pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> to cut along imaginary lines extending through, or immediately adjacent to, both the X and Y axis of pin one indicator/alignment fiducial <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and along two severable edges (package edges) of BGA substrate <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. A chip scale package <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> singulated by the present method is shown in drawing <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
