<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Storage devices for storing electronic data such as music files have steadily decreased in size and cost while increasing in storage capacity over the years. Such devices as Compact Discs, and flash memory cards such as the Sony Memory Stick&trade; have made it possible to store high quality audio files for playback very conveniently by the user. However, it remains impractical for the user to take full advantage of a library of music using such storage mechanisms while remaining mobile. Even with the smallest and most dense storage media, a substantial library of music is impractical to carry around with the user. This is especially true if the user is traveling on foot, bicycle or using public transportation where storage space and convenience can become a major limitation to the amount of music that one can readily carry. This is particularly true if the user is carrying a music player along with a personal digital assistant, cellular telephone and other possessions. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail specific embodiments, with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an example of the principles of the invention and not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments shown and described. In the description below, like reference numerals are used to describe the same, similar or corresponding parts in the several views of the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> block diagram of a system for remote storage of music files and wireless playback by streaming audio according to an embodiment consistent with the invention is shown as <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment illustrated, system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> provides a customer with the ability to store personally owned music or music from a commercial music source <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (e.g., a record company or recording artist) at a data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> for playback at a later time from any suitable location on a music player <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> using a wireless transmission of streaming audio. In accordance with this embodiment, a user may own rights to music (e.g., by purchase or by his or her own creation) that the user stores on electronic storage media within, or playable on, his or her personal computer system <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In order to conveniently have access to this music, the user can utilize a wireless device incorporating a music player <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (e.g., a dedicated personal music player, a PDA, a cellular telephone device or a multifunction device incorporating the music player). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the customer (the terms &ldquo;user&rdquo;, &ldquo;subscriber&rdquo; and &ldquo;customer&rdquo; can be used somewhat interchangeably herein) subscribes to a service provided by the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> for storage of his or her personal library of music. The customer (or approved users) can then upload music files for storage to the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. At the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, these music files are stored on a content server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for future access by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> When the user wishes to play back the music stored at content server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, a request is sent to the data center, preferably by the music player <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> using wireless communication, through a nearby transmitter/receiver site <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> which may be coupled to the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, for example, through a wireless data network <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> (which may include wired and wireless connections) such as a cellular telephone network or other similar infrastructure. When the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> receives a valid request for playback, the content server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> streams real time or near real time audio back to the user through the wireless network <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and nearby transmitter/receiver site <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to the music player <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The music player may then play back the audio in real time or near real time, thus providing the user with access to this music at any location within range of an appropriate transmitter receiver site <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In another variation of the invention, the user may not only upload music from a personal library as just described for remote wireless access, but may also use the content server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> at the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> for storage of music files provided by a commercial music source <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> such as a record company. In this embodiment, the user requests that the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> obtain and store a particular music selection. The data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> then requests the music from a suitable commercial music source <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and obtains the files via an electronic transfer from the music source <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> for storage on content server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> then pays royalties to the commercial music source <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> (or to a royalty agent) and passes along fees to cover the royalties on to the subscriber. Since the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may purchase rights to a particular selection for numerous subscribers, they may be able to obtain reduced royalty rates that can result in savings that may passed on to the subscriber. Also, since multiple users may wish access to a particular selection, the music selection need only be stored once in content server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> with access to the selection mapped to users who contribute to the royalties (or are otherwise entitled to access the selection, e.g., by virtue of a flat rate subscription). Any number of fee structures can be devised for the implementation of various embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The actions of the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, are preferably implemented using a programmed processor forming a part of, or connected to, content server <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The program steps for carrying out the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> actions may by stored on any suitable electronic storage medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the transmitter/receiver site <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be part of a cellular telephone or other wireless telephone network (or a data network or other communication network) and the streaming audio may be provided by any suitable Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) that is able to support a suitable data rate for acceptable quality audio. However, other wireless communication arrangements can be used including blue tooth for use in smaller areas (e.g., a home network) or using a dedicated wireless network may be provided for distribution of the data. As will be seen later, the circuitry required to implement the present invention at the music player <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be a minimal addition to many existing electronic communication devices such as PDAs and cellular telephones, lending itself to easy incorporation into such devices to not only eliminate the need to carry a collection of stored music, but also to eliminate the need to carry a separate player. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The process described above is illustrated as process <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> starting at <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. At <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, a customer subscribes to a music storage and streaming service provided by the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. From the customer perspective, the services of the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the music player <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> are idle until the customer makes a request at <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. If the request is to store music at <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, the customer request for music storage is sent to the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> receives the request at <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> to store an audio selection for the customer. At <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> stores the music files for the customer. The files can be received either from a customer download or obtained from a commercial music source such as <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The customer may then (depending upon the subscription arrangement) be charged a fee by the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> based upon the amount of data, or number of files or other criteria for data storage. If such a fee is charged at <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, it is accumulated in the customer subscription for the next billing cycle at <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and the system awaits the next customer request at <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> If the request at <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is not for storage of music files, control passes to <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to determine if the request is to playback music. If the request is for music playback at <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> the customer request is sent to the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> at <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. The data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> receives the request to streaming audio selection to the customer at <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>. Assuming the customer request is valid, the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> sends streaming audio files via a wireless channel to the customer at <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. At the music player <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the music player <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> receives the streaming music file and plays back the music for the customer at <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> in real time or near real time. The customer may again be charged based on usage at <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> (depending upon the subscription arrangement) which is accumulated in the next customer subscription billing cycle at <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. In the event the request at <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is not for playing music, other request handling such as account management may be handled at <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an embodiment of a wireless music player <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is illustrated. In this embodiment, only the circuitry used for the music player <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is illustrated. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that music player <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be incorporated within a cellular telephone or other device without departing from the invention. Music player <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a wireless transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> that receives and transmits data through an antenna <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. When receiving streaming music data, wireless transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> passes received data to a streaming audio decoder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> for decoding. Streaming audio decoder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> may decode compressed streaming audio files such as MP3 or ACC files. Streaming audio decoder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> may incorporate or utilize a separate cache memory <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to facilitate providing continuous music to the user in the event of momentary dropouts in the wireless transmission. Moreover, streaming audio decoder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> may be implemented as either hardware or software without departing from the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Decoded streaming audio from streaming audio decoder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is passed to an audio amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> which in turn drives one or more audio transducers such as those incorporated in headphones <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> to provide the user with audible music. Music player <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> also incorporates a suitable user interface <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> coupled to a control processor <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> such as a microprocessor having associated program memory <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. When the user wishes to control the playback or send a request to the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the user does so utilizing the user interface <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. Such a request is then processed by the processor <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> and passed on to transmitter portion of all of wireless transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> for transmission using antenna <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. Control processor <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> may also be utilized to effect various controls over the wireless transmitter/receiver <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, streaming audio decoder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and audio amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, and may be interconnected thereto, for example, using a multi-wire bus arrangement as illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that music player <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of components that may already be present in some form within various electronic devices such as a PDA or a cellular telephone. In general, streaming audio decoder <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> (implemented as either hardware or software) and modifications to the user interface <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and a control program stored in program memory <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> could be the major modifications required to certain existing electronic devices in order to implement the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention has been described in terms of exemplary embodiments based upon use of a programmed processor within the music player <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> as well as the data center <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. However, the invention should not be so limited, since the present invention could be implemented using hardware component equivalents such as special purpose hardware and/or dedicated processors which are equivalents to the invention as described and claimed. Similarly, general purpose computers, microprocessor based computers, micro-controllers, optical computers, analog computers, dedicated processors and/or dedicated hard wired logic may be used to construct alternative equivalent embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the program steps used to implement the embodiments described above, at both the data center <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the music player <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, can be implemented using various forms of storage including Read Only Memory (ROM) devices, Random Access Memory (RAM) devices; optical storage elements, disc drives, magnetic storage elements, magneto-optical storage elements, flash memory, core memory and/or other equivalent storage technologies without departing from the present invention. Such alternative storage devices should be considered equivalents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The present invention is preferably implemented using a programmed processor executing programming instructions that are broadly described above in flow chart form and can be stored on any suitable electronic storage medium. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the processes described above can be implemented in any number of variations and in many suitable programming languages without departing from the present invention. For example, the order of certain operations carried out can often be varied, and additional operations can be added without departing from the invention. Error trapping can be added and/or enhanced and variations can be made in user interface and information presentation without departing from the present invention. Such variations are contemplated and considered equivalent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications, permutations and variations will become apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended that the present invention embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variations as fall within the scope of the appended claims.</paragraph>
