<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The skinning pliers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention is composed of a clamping mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for clamping a wire or a cable and a cutting member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a compressing member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> disposed on the clamping mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The clamping mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a first clamping member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, a second clamping member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and a resilient member <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. The middle portion of the second clamping member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected with the middle portion of the first clamping member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, whereby the lower ends thereof form a hold section. Two ends of the resilient member <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are respectively connected with the first and second clamping members <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to always force the first and second clamping members <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> toward each other. The first clamping member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a first clamping section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a first recess <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> formed on a face thereof facing the second clamping member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and a first thread hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> passing through the first clamping member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> between the outer edge thereof and the bottom of the first recess <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The second clamping member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has a second clamping section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> on one side facing the first clamping section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a second recess <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> formed on the second clamping section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a second thread hole <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> passing through the second clamping member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> between the outer edge thereof and the bottom of the second recess <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The cutting member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a body section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> extending by a certain length. The body section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is formed with outer thread for screwing into the first thread hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, whereby the body section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is axially reciprocally movable within the first thread hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. An adjustment section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is disposed at outer end of the body section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> on outer side of the first clamping member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The circumference of the adjustment section is formed with stripes for a user&apos;s fingers to pinch and rotate. The outer end of the adjustment section is formed with a groove <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> for a screwdriver (not shown) to operate and rotate the adjustment section. A blade <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is disposed at inner end of the body section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and extends between the first and second clamping sections <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A coil spring <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is fitted around the body section <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and positioned between the first clamping member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the adjustment section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for maintaining the cutting member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in its home position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The compressing member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a shape similar to that of the cutting member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The compressing member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a body section as a thread rod and an adjustment section positioned on outer side of the second clamping member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. However, the inner end of the compressing member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is free from any blade and is instead formed with a boss extending between the first and second clamping sections <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> When a user uses the pliers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to pare the insulating layer of a wire, by means of the adjustment section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the blade <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is slightly protruded from the bottom of the first recess <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1 </cross-reference>). Then, the hold section of the pliers is operated so as to clamp the wire between the first and second recesses <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the first and second clamping sections <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. At this time, the blade <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> thrusts the insulating layer. Then, the user only needs to turn the wire or the pliers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by one circle about the axis of the wire so as to form an annular cut a on the insulating layer. Thereafter, the user loosens the wire and turns the cutting member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by 90 degrees. Then the wire is again clamped and the pliers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is moved along the axis the wire. Accordingly, the wire is cut with an elongated cut b extending from the annular cut a to the end of the wire. Therefore, the user can easily pare the cut section of insulating layer from the wire. In addition, the present invention can be also used to cut off a water tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When the user desires to fix a terminal (not shown) on the end of the wire free from the insulating layer, the end of the wire is first fitted into the tubular section of the terminal. Then, the cutting member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is adjusted to retract the blade <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into the first thread hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The compressing member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is adjusted to make the inner end thereof protrude from the bottom of the second recess <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2 </cross-reference>). Then, the terminal and the wire is placed into the first recess <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the hold section of the pliers is operated to force the inner end of the compressing member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to strongly compress and deform the terminal, whereby the terminal is firmly associated with the end of the wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the first recess <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> serves to hold the terminal and prevent the terminal from slipping. The inner end of the first thread hole <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> corresponds to the compressing member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so that when the inner end of the compressing member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> compresses the terminal, the end of the terminal is easily deformed and fixed with the wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the skinning pliers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention can be used in cooperation with a casing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The casing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a long tube <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, an insertion leg <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> having a certain length and disposed on outer side of the long tube <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and an opening <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> formed on a lateral side of the long tube <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. In use, the insertion leg <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is first inserted into the second thread hole <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to fix the casing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on the second clamping member <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Then, a wire is passed through the long tube <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and the first and second clamping sections <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are forced to get close to each other. The tip of the blade <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is extended through the opening <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> into the long tube <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to cut the insulating layer of the wire and form a cut thereon. The main function of the casing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is that the opening <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> serves to restrict the length of the tip of the blade <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> extending into the long tube <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. Therefore, this is applicable to those situations necessitating high precision, for example, cutting of an optic fiber cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows another embodiment of the present invention, in which the cutting member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the compressing member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are together disposed on the first clamping member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The second clamping section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is formed with a wedge-shaped notch <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for placing a terminal thereon. The notch <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> corresponds to the inner end of the compressing member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows still another embodiment of the present invention, in which a simple pliers is equipped with a first seat body <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a second seat body <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> respectively fixable on the first and second clamping members <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The opposite end faces of the first and second seat bodies <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are respectively formed with a first and a second recessed clamping sections <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for easily clamping a wire therebetween. The lateral sides of the first and second clamping sections <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are respectively formed with extension sections <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> locked on the first and second clamping members <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by screws <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> screwed in the first and second thread holes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The cutting member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is screwed in the first seat body <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The blade <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can extend between the first and second seat bodies <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the resilient member <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is arched and has two ends as reverse hooks previously inlaid in the dents formed on outer sides of the first and second clamping members <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The resilient member <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> serves to forcedly close the first and second clamping members <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In addition, by means of the arched resilient member <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, the pliers can be hung on a wall face. </paragraph>
