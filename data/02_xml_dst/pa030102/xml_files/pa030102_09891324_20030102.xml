<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to VLSI device manufacturing, and more particularly to manufacturing high dielectric constant capacitors in a multi-level metal VLSI devices. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In today&apos;s high performance very large scale integration (&ldquo;VLSI&rdquo;) devices (or chips), the use of on-chip bypass capacitors is essential. For example, in the design of high-performance microprocessors, on-chip bypass capacitors often act as a reservoir of electrical charge, reduce power requirements for the microprocessors, and/or lower the occurrence of ground bounce. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Ground bounce is noise generated by the simultaneous switching of transistor devices of the device. The noise is typically generated during the logic HIGH to LOW transition where the resultant potential difference, i.e., ground bounce, is between the device ground and an external ground. When several outputs of component devices of a VLSI device switch simultaneously, the total build up of current in the common ground or a power lead may be substantial. There may be a complementary effect in a power lead of the device called power bounce. Failure to control power and/or ground bounce may lead to timing failures, spurious switching, and excessive electromagnetic interference. Accordingly, ground and/or power bounce may limit the overall performance of a VLSI device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> On-chip bypass capacitors are commonly implemented by metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (&ldquo;MOSFET&rdquo;). In order to configure a MOSFET as a capacitor in a VLSI device, the source and gate of the MOSFET are typically connected to a power rail with the gate of the MOSFET connected to a ground of the VLSI device. However, in advanced technology VLSI devices, the transistors are of a scale that the gate thickness of a typical MOSFET capacitor is reduced to the atomic level, e.g., 20 Angstroms (&angst;). As a result, the gates of MOSFET capacitors are susceptible to a high level of leakage current. The leakage current may lead to undesirable effects in a VLSI device such as higher power consumption, functionality failure during testing, etc. Moreover, another drawback is a MOSFET type on-chip bypass capacitors are spatially large, i.e., consumes valuable silicon area of a VLSI device, thereby increasing the cost of production of the VLSI device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An alternative to MOSFET capacitors is a metal-insulator-metal (&ldquo;MIM&rdquo;) capacitor. A MIM capacitor is typically formed by wiring metals together in a conventional multi-level metallization VLSI system. As it is generally known, a VLSI device may use multiple layers of metal to form interconnections between the component devices of the VLSI device. The MIM capacitors may be formed in a vertical or a horizontal dimensional. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A typical MIM capacitor may have several advantages over a MOSFET capacitor. For instance, leakage current in the MIM capacitors is negligible because of a relatively thick insulating area (200 nm-1 um) between the metals forming a MIM capacitor. Furthermore, MIM capacitors may be built on top of component devices, e.g., transistors, of the VLSI system. As a result, MIM capacitors do not incur an area penalty as suffered by the MOSFET capacitors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, MIM capacitors may still have several disadvantages. For example, a MIM capacitor may have a low capacitance per unit area. The typical minimum thickness of an insulator in a MIM capacitor is approximately 2000 &angst;. The thickness of the MIM capacitor may not be reduced due to current resolution of conventional lithography techniques. Since the typical thickness of a MIM capacitor is 100 times larger than the transistor gate thickness of a MOSFET capacitor, the capacitance of the MIM capacitor is approximately 100 times less than that of a MOSFET capacitor. As it is generally known, capacitance is inversely proportional to insulator thickness. Accordingly, MIM capacitors usually cannot supply sufficient charge to the power rails to suppress power and/or ground bounce. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> For simplicity and illustrative purposes, the principles of the present invention are described by referring mainly to an exemplary embodiment of a method for manufacturing a high dielectric constant capacitor. However, one of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize that the same principles are equally applicable to all types of capacitors, and can be implemented in any semiconductor device, and that any such variation would be within such modifications that do not depart from the true spirit and scope of the present invention. Moreover, in the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate specific embodiments in which the present invention may be practiced. Electrical, mechanical, logical and structural changes may be made to the embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> According to a disclosed embodiment of the present invention, a method or process of manufacturing on-chip bypass capacitors on a VLSI device (or chip) is improved by utilizing a high-dielectric constant metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor manufacturing process. In one aspect, the present invention pertains to improving the relatively poor capacitance efficiency of conventional MIM capacitors by growing a thin layer of a high dielectric (high-k), e.g., 10-100, constant insulator at the interface of metal lines and vias. Although the present invention contemplates using a high-k dielectric constant within a range of 4-10, it should be readily apparent that dielectric constant value may be any user-specified without departing from the scope or spirit of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention relates to a high-k constant MIM capacitor. The high-k constant MIM capacitor may comprise a lower electrode in a first metal layer of a VLSI device, a substantially thin layer of high-k insulator (e.g., silicon nitride, lead zirconate titanate (&ldquo;PZT&rdquo;), etc.,) at an interface of the first metal layer and a via, and an upper electrode form in a second metal layer. The via provides a channel between the second metal layer to the high-k insulator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the present invention, the high-k insulator layer may be formed from a composite of materials to yield the high dielectric constant. For instant, the high-k insulator layer may be comprised of a dielectric material, e.g., PZT, in between two barrier layers. The barrier layers may be implemented with platinum or other similar conductors. The barrier layers may be used in the event that the metal of the electrodes cannot interface with the insulator. Although in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a high-k insulator layer may be comprised of a dielectric material positioned between two barrier layers, it should be readily apparent that other combinations of materials to form a high-k dielectric constant insulator layer are contemplated by the present invention and do not depart from the scope or spirit of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In yet another aspect of the present invention, multiple vias may be placed where the upper and lower electrodes overlap forming an array of vias. The area encompassed by the array of via may form the high-k constant MIM capacitor. By controlling the number of vias in an array, the capacitance of a high-k constant MIM capacitor may be customized to a VLSI device. Moreover, since the thickness of the high-k constant insulator may be significantly smaller than a conventional MIM capacitor, the high-k constant MIM capacitor has a higher capacitance. In addition, the high-k constant of the insulator layer contributes to an increase in the capacitance per unit area of the high-k constant MIM capacitor as compared to a conventional MIM capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary schematic of a high-k constant MIM capacitor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> lower electrode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is formed during deposition of a first metal layer for signal lines <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of a VLSI device. The lower electrode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be formed among several metal signal lines in a parallel line configuration in order to avoid a dishing effect during the chemical-mechanical polishing (&ldquo;CMP&rdquo;) of the first metal layer. On top of the lower electrode <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a relatively thin, e.g., 50-100 &angst;, high-k insulator layer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is deposited on top of the first metal layer of the VLSI device. Although in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the thickness of the insulator layer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may range from 50-100 &angst;, it should be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that the thickness may be a user-designated value without departing from the scope or spirit of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> After the high-k insulator layer is deposited, a second layer of metal is deposited to form a via array <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and an upper electrode <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The upper electrode <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may also be formed among several metal signal lines in a parallel line configuration to avoid the dishing effect during a subsequent CMP step. Accordingly, high-k constant MIM capacitors may be formed between any layers of metal of a multi-level VLSI device or VLSI system with a small variation in conventional fabrication techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the lower and upper electrodes, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, respectively, are substantially parallel in an X-Y plane and overlap one another. It should be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the high-k constant MIM capacitor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be formed in the overlap region of the electrodes, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, without regard to the size of the overlap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary flow diagram of a fabrication process <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for fabricating a high-k constant MIM capacitor with FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>E illustrating a side view of the fabrication process <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> on an exemplary VLSI device. In particular, the fabrication process <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may begin when spaces for signal lines <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>) and bottom electrodes <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> are etched out of a dielectric layer <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, in step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. After the etching, a first metal layer <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is applied over the etched dielectric layer <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> filling in the spaces for signal lines <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Subsequently, a metal mask layer (not shown) may be applied to pattern bottom electrodes <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> of a high-k constant MIM capacitor in the metal as well as signal lines <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> for the VLSI chip. The first metal layer <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> is then reduced to the bottom electrodes <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> and/or signal lines <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> by a CMP process. A CMP machine may implement the CMP process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in step <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, a high-k insulator layer, such as silicon nitride (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>), is deposited on top of the VLSI chip. Alternatively, a composite of materials, e.g., a composite of PZT and platinum, may be used to form the high-k insulator layer. In step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the high-k insulator layer is patterned and etched to form the insulator layer <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of the high-k constant MIM capacitor over the bottom electrodes <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, where the thickness of the insulator layer may be between 50-100 &angst;. However, other user specified values for thickness are within the scope and spirit of the present invention. The patterning of the high-k insulator layer removes the high-k insulator layer from contacting the signal lines <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Optionally, after the etching of the insulator layer <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, the insulator layer <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may be polished to remove improve planarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in step <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, an interlevel dielectric layer <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> such as silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, etc., is deposited over the VLSI chip. In particular, the interlevel dielectric <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> has been deposited over the high-k insulator layer <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> which covers the bottom electrode <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, the signal lines <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and the dielectric <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the interlevel dielectric layer <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is subsequently patterned and etched to carve a space for signal via <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</cross-reference>) to the signal line <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and electrode vias <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> to the bottom electrodes <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, respectively. A second layer of signal lines may also be formed in the interlevel dielectric layer <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in step <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>, a second layer of metal <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is deposited on top of the patterned interlevel dielectric layer <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</cross-reference>) to form the signal via <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> and the electrode vias <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>, and an upper electrode <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> of a high-k constant MIM capacitor <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. The second layer of metal is finished by a second CMP process to complete the vias <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> and upper electrode <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, in step <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Although, for illustrative purposes, the process for manufacturing only one high-k constant MIM capacitor is discussed shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it should be understood and readily apparent to those familiar with semiconductor processing that there may be any number of high-k constant MIM capacitors manufactured on a VLSI chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described with reference to the exemplary embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will be able to make various modifications to the described embodiments of the invention without departing from the true spirit and scope of the invention.
