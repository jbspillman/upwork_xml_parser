<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to engine exhaust handling apparatus, and more particularly, to apparatus for noise abatement and catalytic treatment of internal combustion engine exhaust gasses. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the burning of petroleum fuels in an internal combustion engine, hydrocarbons in the fuel and nitrogen and oxygen from the air used to combust the fuel combine to yield various oxides and nitrides, principally comprising carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and nitric oxide. Waste materials in the fuel, such as sulphur produce other oxides such as sulphur dioxide. Additionally, some of the fuel passes into the exhaust partially combusted or uncombusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Often the particular oxides are more harmful to human beings than other oxides of the same elements. For example carbon dioxide may pose less of a hazard than carbon monoxide. In order to minimize the more harmful emissions, most larger internal combustion engines, particularly those used in automobiles are equipped with exhaust gas catalysts in their exhaust systems (&ldquo;catalytic converters&rdquo;) to convert less desirable oxides to more desirable oxides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Automobiles generally have a fair amount of space available for both a catalytic converter and for noise abatement apparatus such as a muffler and a resonator to suppress the noise ordinarily associated with internal combustion engine operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Smaller engines in applications such as lawnmowers are significant generators of pollutants but in the past have seldom if ever been equipped with exhaust treatment apparatus, despite that for their size they often generate proportionately more harmful emissions. A reason for this may be the lack of expensive and sophisticated engine management systems found in more expensive applications such as automobiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide a catalytic muffler of compact dimensions which is easily accommodated in small displacement internal combustion engine applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a compact catalytic muffler which also has noise attenuation capabilities to obviate the need for a separate muffler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is also an object of the present invention to provide a noise abating catalytic muffler design for small engine applications which is simple and comparatively inexpensive to produce and which lends itself readily both to O.E.M. and retrofit applications. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A catalytic muffler having a housing with a first chamber and a second chamber fluidly communicating through a catalyst bed interspersed there between. A first baffle assembly in the first chamber extends between the catalyst bed and the housing. An inlet passage extends through the housing into the first chamber. An outlet passage extends through the housing into one of the first and second chambers. A second baffle assembly in the second chamber extends between the catalyst bed and the housing. The first and second baffle assemblies act in conjunction with the housing and the reactor bed to define a flow passage through the housing from the inlet passage through at least three discreet zones of the reactor bed to the outlet passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The inlet and outlet passages may extend through the first chamber, either through an end of the first chamber or a side of the first chamber as desired. Alternatively, the inlet passage may extend into the first chamber and the outlet passage may extend into the second chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The reactor bed may include an oxidizing catalyst in one part thereof and a reducing catalyst in another part thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The reducing catalyst may be upstream of the oxidizing catalyst. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The housing may be cylindrical.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A catalytic muffler according to the present invention is generally indicated by reference <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the accompanying illustrations. The catalytic muffler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is illustrated as having a generally cylindrical housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> however it will be appreciated that other shapes of housing might also be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a first chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at one end thereof, and, a second chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at the opposite end. A catalyst bed <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> occupies the space between the first chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the second chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The catalyst bed may be a catalyst bearing ceramic (or possibly other) substrate having a honeycomb like configuration with a plurality of discreet flow passages <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extending longitudinally therethrough. Accordingly, the first and second chambers, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> respectively, fluidly communicate with each other through the reactor bed <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> An inlet passage <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extends through the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into the first chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Depending on the application, the inlet passage may extend into either a side (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) or an end of the housing. Also depending on the application, the inlet passage may have various configurations and include such arrangements as a threaded opening and a tubular elbow. The specific configuration chosen will generally depend on the exhaust system configuration and availability of space in the intended application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> An outlet passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may extend either from the first chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or the second chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The outlet passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may extend either from a side or an end of the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As with the inlet passage <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the location and configuration of the outlet passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will generally depend on the parameters associated with the intended application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A first baffle assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is housed within the first chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The first baffle assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is a member with a generally T-shaped configuration. The member extends between the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the reactor bed so as to divide the first chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into first, second and third parts, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> respectively. The first part <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the third part <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> each represent about one fourth (&frac14;) of the volume of the first chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The third part represents about one half (&frac12;) of the volume of the first chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A second baffle assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is housed within the second chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and extends between the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the reactor bed <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to divide the second chamber into first and second parts <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> respectively. The first part <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the second part <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are of roughly equal volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The first baffle assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, second baffle assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and reactor bed <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> cooperate to define a flow passage through at least first, second and third discreet zones, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, respectively, of the reactor bed <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Gas is therefore directed to flow from the inlet passage <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into the first part <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the first chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, through the first zone <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, through the first part <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the second chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, through the second zone <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the reactor bed <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into the second part <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the first chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and through the third zone <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the reactor bed into the second part <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the second chamber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. If the outlet passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> communicates with the second part <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the second chamber <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, gas will be discharged therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> If the outlet passage <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> communicates with the third part <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the first chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, gas will flow from the second part <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the second chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through a fourth zone <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the reactor bed, into the third part of the first chamber <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and out through the outlet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In this latter embodiment, gas will flow four times through the reactor bed <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> albeit through a different zone each time. In the former embodiment, gas will flow three times through the reactor bed <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, through a different zone each time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The reactor bed <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may itself be made up of more than one section and one section may bear an oxidizing catalyst with another section bearing a reducing catalyst. It is expected that the catalytic muffler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be more effective if the reducing section is upstream of the oxidizing section, for example, if the first zone <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and second zone <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> promote reduction and the third zone <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and fourth zone <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> (if there is a fourth zone) promote oxidation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> One manner of configuring the catalytic muffler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is illustrated in the exploded view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is made up of first and second disc-shaped parts <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> which may be joined at respective outer edges to a sleeve <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The first baffle member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be generally P-shaped, or alternatively, T-shaped and act as a spacer to locate the reactor bed <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> within the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The second baffle member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be rectangular or alternatively, generally D-shaped and act as a further spacer to locate the reactor bed <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> within the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Retainer rings <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> may also be provided to engage the interior of the sleeve <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to locate the reactor bed <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be in three parts with a first cup-shaped part <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and second cup-shaped part <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> capping opposite ends of the sleeve <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As yet a further alternative, the housing may be made up of first and second cup-shaped parts <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> respectively which may be joined at respective outer edges <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The above description is intended in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. Variations to the exact structures described may be apparent to those skilled in such structures without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the claims set out below. </paragraph>
