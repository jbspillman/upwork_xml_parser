<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to engine exhaust handling apparatus, and more particularly, to apparatus for noise abatement and catalytic treatment of internal combustion engine exhaust gasses. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the burning of petroleum fuels in an internal combustion engine, hydrocarbons in the fuel and nitrogen and oxygen from the air used to combust the fuel combine to yield various oxides and nitrides, principally comprising carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and nitric oxide. Waste materials in the fuel, such as sulphur produce other oxides such as sulphur dioxide. Additionally, some of the fuel passes into the exhaust partially combusted or uncombusted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Some oxides are more harmful to human beings than other oxides. For example carbon dioxide may pose less of a hazard than carbon monoxide. In order to minimize the more harmful emissions, most larger internal combustion engines, particularly those used in automobiles are equipped with exhaust gas catalysts in their exhaust systems (&ldquo;catalytic converters&rdquo;) to convert less desirable oxides to more desirable oxides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Automobiles generally have a fair amount of space available for both a catalytic converter and for noise abatement apparatus such as mufflers and resonators to suppress the noise ordinally associated with internal combustion engine operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Smaller engines in applications such as lawnmowers are significant generators of pollutants but in the past have seldom if ever been equipped with exhaust treatment apparatus, despite that for their size they often generate proportionately more harmful emissions. Reasons for this may include the lack of expensive and sophisticated engine management systems found in more expensive applications such as automobiles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to provide an efficient catalytic muffler design which lends itself to compact dimensions so as to be easily accommodated in internal combustion engine applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a compact catalytic muffler which also has noise attenuation capabilities to obviate the need for a separate muffler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is also an object of the present invention to provide a noise abating catalytic muffler design for small engine applications which is simple and comparatively inexpensive to produce and which lends itself readily both to O.E.M. and retrofit applications. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A catalytic muffler having at least one reactor bed, each bed having an array of discreet adjacent flow zones, the flow zones being interconnected by a series of passages for unidirectional flow of a gaseous fluid sequentially through each adjacent zone in turn from an inlet side of each reactor bed to an outlet side of the reactor bed. An inlet fluidly communicates with a first of the flow zones. An outlet fluidly communicates with the last of the flow zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The catalytic muffler may include a housing having a partition dividing the housing into a reactor side and a return side. The reactor bed may be housed within the reactor side. The adjacent zones may be defined by wall members extending between the reactor bed, the housing and the partition at the inlet and outlet sides of the bed. The passages may be defined by baffle members in the return side of the housing, the baffle members extending between the partition and the housing. The passages may fluidly communicate with respective of the flow zones through respective apertures extending through the partition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The catalytic muffler may have two reactor beds spaced apart with inlet sides facing. A single inlet may fluidly communicate with both of the first zones and a respective outlet may fluidly communicate with each of the last zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The catalytic muffler may have two reactor beds spaced apart with outlet sides facing. A respective inlet may fluidly communicate with each of the first zones and a single outlet may fluidly communicate with both of the last zones. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A first of the passages may diverge in the flow direction to reduce exhaust gas velocity as it flows therethrough and a last of the passages may converge to increase gas velocity as it flows therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A last of the apertures before the outlet may include an adjustable flow restrictor for varying flow restriction through the catalytic muffler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The first passage may diverge by an amount corresponding to an amount by which the last passage converges. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The reactor bed may be made up of two parts, namely an upstream part and a downstream part. The upstream part may bear a reducing catalyst and the downstream part an oxidizing catalyst.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A catalytic muffler according to the present invention is generally indicated by reference <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the accompanying drawings. The catalytic muffler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a generally rectangular housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a partition <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> dividing the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into a reactor side <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a return side <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The reactor side <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> houses at least one reactor bed, however, in a more preferred embodiment it houses a reducing bed <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an oxidizing bed <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The reactor beds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> respectively may be a conventional honeycomb ceramic substrate having a plurality of discrete flow passages <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extending longitudinally therethrough. A catalyst is typically borne by the substrate which, in the case of the oxidizing bed <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> promotes further oxidation of gases passing therethrough, and in the case of the reducing bed <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, provides reduction of gasses passing therethrough. Preferably the reducing bed <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is located upstream of the oxidizing bed <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The oxidizing and reducing beds, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> respectively, are divided into an array of discrete adjacent flow zones <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by wall members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extending between the oxidizing and reducing beds <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> respectively, the housing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the partition <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The oxidizing and reducing beds <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> respectively, each have an inlet side <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> at one end thereof and an outlet side <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at an opposite end thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The return side of the catalytic muffler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is divided by baffle members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> into a series of adjacent flow passages including an upstream passage <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a downstream passage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and an intermediate passage <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The upstream passage <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> fluidly communicates with the outlet side <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the flow zone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which may be considered as the &ldquo;first&rdquo; flow zone through an aperture <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The upstream flow passage <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> also communicates with the inlet side <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the adjacent flow zone <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through an aperture <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> extending through the partition <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In a similar manner, the intermediate flow passage <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> provides fluid communication between the outlet side <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the flow zone <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the inlet side <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the adjacent flow zone <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through respective apertures <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> extending through the partition <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The downstream flow passage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> provides fluid communication between the outlet side <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the flow zone <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the inlet side <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the flow zone <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which may be considered the &ldquo;last&rdquo; flow zone through respective apertures <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> extending through the partition <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In other words, gas flow through the catalytic muffler is directed from an inlet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> into the inlet side <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the first flow zone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, sequentially through the adjacent flow zones <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to exit through an outlet <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> fluidly communicating with the outlet side <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the last flow zone <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, with gas flow through the reactor beds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> being unidirectional, from the inlet side <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to the outlet side <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> flow restrictor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be provided at the aperture <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to restrict flow through the catalytic muffler. The flow restrictor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be a disc <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> registering with the aperture <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and movable toward and away from the aperture <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> by an adjusting screw <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> threadedly engaging the housing, a portion of which is represented by a nut <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. Turning the restrictor <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will affect flow resistance through the catalytic muffler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to vary flow velocity through various parts of the catalytic muffler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> As also illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the baffle members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are configured to cause the upstream passage <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to diverge in the flow direction, illustrated by arrows <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The baffle members are further configured to provide a generally constant cross-sectional area in the intermediate passage <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and to cause the downstream passage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to converge in the flow direction <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that the gas flow will reduce in velocity and pressure along the upstream passage <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, remain at a generally constant velocity and pressure along the intermediate passage <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and increase in velocity and pressure along the downstream passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> It is believed that the above arrangement for varying velocity and pressure has a generally beneficial effect on the performance of the catalytic muffler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. It is also believed that the temperature profile in the reactor bed (or beds <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the preferred embodiment) arising from sequential unidirectional flow through adjacent zones enhances the degree of catalytic conversion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Although four adjacent flow zones <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are described and illustrated, other numbers may be both possible and desirable depending on design parameters for specific applications. In general it is expected that the degree of conversion will be greater with more zones but that this will also increase flow resistance (assuming a given reactor bed size). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> An alternate embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 10</cross-reference>. According to the alternate embodiment, a catalytic muffler is generally indicated by reference <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The catalytic muffler <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is in essence a doubling up of the catalytic muffler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the previously described embodiment and has two reactor beds <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> spaced apart with respective inlet sides <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> facing away from each other and respective outlet sides <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> facing toward each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The catalytic muffler <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a housing <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> as in the previously described embodiment which is partitioned by a partition <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> into a reactor side <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and a return side <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Wall members <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> extending between the inlet sides <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the reactor beds <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the partition <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and the housing <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and between the outlet sides <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the reactor beds <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the housing <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the partition <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> define adjacent flow zones <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> in each reactor bed <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Flow zone <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be considered a &ldquo;first&rdquo; flow zone and flow zone <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> a &ldquo;last&rdquo; flow zone based on gas flow direction as indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The upstream flow passage <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> fluidly communicates at its centre with the outlet side <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of the first zones <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> through the aperture <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and with the inlet side <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of adjacent flow zones <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> through apertures <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The downstream flow passage <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> fluidly communicates at opposite ends thereof with the inlet sides <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the next adjacent flow zones <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> through apertures <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Respective inlets <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> fluidly communicate with the inlet sides <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the first flow zone <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> through the housing <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. An outlet <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> fluidly communicates with the outlet sides <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> of each of the last flow zones <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Accordingly exhaust flows unidirectionally from the inlets <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> through each reactor bed <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from the inlet side <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to the outlet side <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> in sequence from the first flow zone <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> through adjacent flow zones <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and finally through the last flow zone <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and out of the outlets <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that although a single reactor bed <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> has been described, it can in turn be made up of a plurality of beds such as a reducing bed <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and an oxidizing bed <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As in the case of the &ldquo;single inlet/single outlet&rdquo; design initially described, the alternate embodiment or &ldquo;single inlet/double outlet&rdquo; design may have its baffle members <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> configured to vary the cross sectional area of at least the downstream passage <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Similarly a restrictor <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> may be mounted over one or more of the apertures, such as the apertures <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> or the aperture <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to adjust the resistance to flow of the catalytic muffler and to balance the flow through each side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A feature of the double inlet/single outlet design is that it can be configured to operate in a reverse mode, i.e. single inlet/double outlet. If a single reactor bed <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is used the reconfiguration would merely require connecting the inlets <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> and outlet <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> in reverse. If a plurality of reactor beds, such as reducing beds <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and oxidizing beds <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are provided, reversal of the sequence of the beds may be desirable to best take advantage of exhaust temperature and chemistry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Although test results have not shown any requirement to add further oxygen, such may be desirable in some applications in which case provision might be made such as an excess air inlet port through the housing <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> or into the inlet <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The principal difference between the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 10</cross-reference> embodiment and the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 through 14</cross-reference> embodiment is the use of cylindrical rather than rectangular substrates in the reactor beds <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Currently some substrate materials, such as metallic ones are not generally available in a rectangular configuration but rather, are only available in a cylindrical configuration. Accordingly, the reactor beds <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> include a housing having tubular passageways <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> arranged in a parallel side-by-side arrangement between generally rectangular end walls <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> from which the wall members <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> extend. Accordingly the reactor bed <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in this configuration includes a plurality of individual substrates rather than a single substrate partitioned directly by the wall members <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> A similar arrangement utilizing cylindrical substrate members may be adapted to the single inlet/single outlet variant catalytic muffler <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The above description is intended in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense.
