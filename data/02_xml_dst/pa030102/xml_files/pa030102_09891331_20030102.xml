<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to the management of programs for home entertainment devices, such as televisions and Set Top Boxes. More particularly it relates to a method, a multimedia terminal, a mobile terminal, and a computer program for transferring Electronic Program Guides between different terminals and the editing of Electronic Program Guide data. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An Electronic Program Guide (EPG) is an application provided in a multimedia terminal or a home entertainment device, such as a Set Top Box (STB) designed to aid a viewer in the navigation of and selection from broadcast programs in a digital system. By means of the EPG, it is possible to make settings in the home entertainment device. It is also possible to register reminders and planned recordings as well as to filter the large amount of information available through the EPG. It is even possible to create a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; channel comprising programs from different channels, as is described in the international publication WO 00/40028. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> However, a problem associated with the use of EPGs is that the management thereof can be time-consuming considering the amount of information involved; an EPG covering one week normally contains several thousands of TV programs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Another problem associated with the use of STBs and EPGs is that STBs are stationary whilst persons using EPGs are mobile. This means that a person having a STB must be in the same room or have access to the Internet in order to benefit from the EPG provided for that STB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A further problem is that the opportunities to share the work put into an edited EPG are limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The patent documents U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,130,726 A, 5,710,605, and WO 00/59212 disclose distribution of EPG functionality between a STB and a remote control. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the following, a detailed description of embodiments of the invention will be given. In the description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, specific details are set forth, such as particular hardware, applications, techniques etc. in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be utilized in other embodiments that depart from these specific details. In other instances, detailed descriptions of well-known methods, apparatuses, and circuits are omitted so as not to obscure the description of the present invention with unnecessary details. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> flow chart describing the general inventive idea is shown. In a first step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, data of an Electronic Program Guide (EPG) is retrieved by means of a Set Top Box (STB) or a Personal Computer (PC) connected to an information network, such as a cable, terrestrial, or satellite network, the Internet etc. This retrieval can be effected automatically, such as every night, or at the request of a user. The EPG data comprises information regarding TV programs during the next seven days, for example, such as TV channel, name, a unique identification, start and stop times, a classification (adult, children, sports etc.), and sometimes a short abstract. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Considering the large amount of data, this can optionally be filtered in a second step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. This filtering can delete data regarding TV programs falling outside of the field of interest of the EPG user and is a known feature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In a third step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> the EPG Data is transferred from the stationary terminal to a Mobile Terminal (MT), such as a mobile phone or a PDA. This transfer can be performed in several ways, as will be described below. The MT is provided with software for managing an EPG. This software is used in a fourth step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> for editing the EPG data downloaded to the MT. This editing can include setting reminders and recordings as well as further filtering of the data. Because this editing is performed in a mobile terminal, it can be done in a more convenient way and when the user has no access to a device conventionally used for editing EPG Data, such as an STB connected to a display unit, such as a TV set. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When the EPG data has been edited, it is subsequently transferred in a fifth step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to an STB used for displaying the TV programs on a TV set, for example. Sometimes, the transferred data contains information in conflict with information already stored in the STB to which the data is transferred. For example, data requesting recording of a program on a specific TV channel at a specific time is in conflict with a request for recording another program on another TV channel at the specific time. In that case, in a sixth step <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, the user is given the choice of either replacing the previously recorded request with the request in the now downloaded data or keeping the old request. In the latter case, the request for recording can be transformed into a reminder instead. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A first example of an implementation of the inventive method will now be given with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, wherein an STB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an MT <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are shown in detail. The STB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided in a home entertainment environment comprising a TV set <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) for displaying TV programs. The STB is also connected to a source of EPG Data <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> through some kind of communication network <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, such as a cable, terrestrial, or satellite network, the Internet etc. It is thus possible to retrieve an EPG by means of the STB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the STB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises control electronics <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> controlling the function of the device. Various other parts are connected to the electronics <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, such as a tuner <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> arranged to receive digital audio and video information, a modem <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> connectable to a data network, such as the Internet, an electronic storage <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for software and data, such as an EPG, an encoder for displaying information on an attached TV set <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and a communication device <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, such as an IR communication device or an RF transceiver device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The mobile terminal <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> also comprises control electronics <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, as is conventional. It further comprises a display <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, such as an LCD, for displaying information, and an input device in the form of a keypad <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> for entering information. A communication device <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is arranged to communicate with the communication device <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the STB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Finally, an electronic storage <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is provided for storing software and data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> When the EPG has been retrieved in the STB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the user can edit the information as is conventional. This editing comprises filtering and setting reminders and requesting recordings. However, at this stage editing is optional in the STB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The EPG data is then transferred to the Mobile Terminal (MT) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In the figure this transfer is shown as being wireless. Thus, any conventional wireless transfer method can be used, such as by means of infrared (IR) communication, radio communication, such as in accordance with the Bluetooth(r) standard, etc. Wireless communication is easy to use and provides for a simple system without too much equipment and devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> When the EPG data has been transferred to the MT, the user can edit the data stored in the MT. This editing can take place anywhere and anytime and is not limited to a location in connection with a multimedia system. For example, if the transfer takes place in the morning, the user can edit the data on his or her way to and from work, sitting on a bus or in a train, for example. This indeed adds another dimension of flexibility to the use of a home entertainment system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> After having edited the EPG Data in the MT <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the user retransmits the now edited data to the STB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Continuing the example above, this can be done after having returned from work, for example. Thus, instead of having to use the EPG when about to watch TV, the user can just sit down and transfer the EPG to the STB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> without the risk of missing a TV program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that the transfer of information to the STB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can involve some kind of authentication procedure. For example, the user must supply a PIN code before the STB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> accepts any recordings or request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The MT <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can contain some kind of personalized filter. By means of this filter, the EPG data transferred to the MT is automatically adapted to the preferences of the user. This use of the inventive method provides for an easy way to adapt a home entertainment environment to a particular user and is a more flexible alternative to having different user profiles stored in the STB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A second example of the use of the inventive method will now be given with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, wherein a Personal Computer (PC) <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> connected to an EPG source <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> via a data or other kind of communication network <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, an MT <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an STB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are shown. In this example, information transmission between the PC <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the MT <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is effected by means of wire, such as by means of a MT docking station connected to the PC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is envisaged that the PC <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can be provided at another location than the STB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as at the user&apos;s office, wherein the PC is connected to the Internet <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. A user can then, during lunchtime, for example, download an EPG to the PC <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from a site on the Internet using TCP/IP and ftp. The user then retransmits the EPG to the MT <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> connected to the PC <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. At his or her way back home after work, the user can edit the EPG Data. After having returned home, the user transmits the data to the STB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, just as in the first example given above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A third example of the use of the inventive method will now be given with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, wherein a first STB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> connected to an EPG source <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> via a data network <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and a second 60 STB are shown together with a first 20 and a second 50 MT. In this example, the information transfer between the different devices is wireless. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The transfer of EPG data from STB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to MT <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is carried out as in the first example above given with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The editing of data in the MT <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has also been described above. However, instead of retransmitting the edited data to the STB <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from which the EPG was retrieved, the data is sent to the second MT <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As an example, the two MTs <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are two mobile phones owned by two friends or working mates. When the owner of the first MT <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has edited the data, he or she gives the data to the owner of the second MT <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The information transfer can be carried out by means of an IR connection commonly found on mobile phones of today, for example. Another way is to use Short Message Service (SMS) or corresponding communication systems to transfer the information to a remote second MT <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The owner of the second MT <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> subsequently transfers the edited data to his or her STB <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which can be situated far from the first MT <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, the inventive method provides for a way to exchange information between different home entertainment systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Preferred embodiments of the invention have been described. It is realized that these can be varied within the scope of the appended claims. For example, encryption of data can be used to increase the level of security, if so desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Also, the transfer of EPG information regarding TV programs has been described. It will be appreciated that other kind of information used in a home entertainment environment could be transferred as well. An example of that are Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to file servers. Thereby, information regarding for example music files, such as MP3 files, can be exchanged between friends and be incorporated in a playlist of programs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In this description references have been made to TV sets. It will be appreciated that these references also cover other kinds of display units, such as computer monitors etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Also, specific communication methods have been described. Other methods and combination of methods are also possible. For example, in the example described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the communication between PC <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and MT <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be by means of wireless communication etc. </paragraph>
