<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to voice-control technology, and more particularly, to a wireless-keyboard based voice-control module with display unit, which is designed specifically for use on a wireless keyboard to allow the user to remotely control the operations of various kinds of remotely-controllable electrical apparatuses, such as a personal computer (PC), a TV-based Internet-access box, a TV set, a DVD player, a stereo unit, an air conditioner, and so on, through voice activation by way of the wireless keyboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A wireless keyboard is a peripheral data input device for a computer system or an TV-based Internet-access box. It allows the user to perform remote data input to the PC and Internet-access box without having to be connected via cables. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Access to Internet has been evolved from narrowband to broadband. One common way of broadband Internet link is through cable TV network, which allows the user to use a cable-linked TV as monitor and gain access to the Internet. To allow a TV set to be linked to the Internet, the TV set should be coupled to a wireless keyboard and an Internet-access box that functions like the main unit of a PC, and the user can control the operations of the Internet through the wireless keyboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One drawback to the use of conventional wireless keyboards, however, is that it nevertheless requires the user to manually press on the many keys on the wireless keyboard in order to input a desired character string or control code to the PC or TV-based Internet-access box, which is quite laborious and time-wasting, particularly when inputting a lengthy character string or sequence of control codes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the room where PC or TV is installed, there are usually installed other various kinds of electrical apparatuses, such as DVD players, stereo units, and air conditioners. These electrical apparatuses typically each come with a dedicated remote controller that allows the user to remotely control the operations of these electrical apparatuses. Therefore, for five different kinds of electrical apparatuses, for example, it requires the user to use five different kinds of dedicated remote controllers for the control of each of these electrical apparatuses, which is quite inconvenient for the user. Moreover, the user is nevertheless required to manually press control buttons provided on the panel of the remote controller to activate a certain control function, which is still quite laborious and inconvenient. For a combined system of two or more electrical apparatuses, such as a combined system of a TV set and a DVD player, since these two electrical apparatuses each have their own dedicated remote controllers, it would be inconvenient for the user to use one remote controller to turn on the TV set and then the other remote controller to turn on the DVD player. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> There are various kinds of voice-control devices available on the consumer electronics market. These voice-control devices allow the user to preset voice commands and corresponding codes. One drawback to these conventional voice-control devices, however, is that they lack the provision of a display unit to display the user-defined codes for user verification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There exists therefore a need in the consumer electronics market for a voice-control module with display unit for use on a wireless keyboard that allows the user to remotely control the operations of various kinds of electrical apparatuses, such as a personal computer (PC), a TV-based Internet-access box, a TV set, a DVD player, a stereo unit, an air conditioner, and so on, through voice activation by way of the wireless keyboard. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an objective of this invention to provide a wireless-keyboard based voice-control module with display unit, which allows the user to remotely control the operations of various kinds of electrical apparatuses, such as personal computer (PC), Internet-linked TV, TV set, DVD player, stereo unit, air conditioner, and so on, through voice activation by way of a wireless keyboard. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the foregoing and other objectives, the invention proposes a novel wireless-keyboard based voice-control module. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The wireless-keyboard based voice-control module of the invention comprises: (a) a display unit, which is capable of displaying user-input alphanumeric characters representative of user-predefined remote-control codes inputted through the alphanumeric keys; (b) a remote-control code database for storing a predefined set of remote-control codes; (c) a voice-sample database for storing a predefined set of voice-samples that are used for voice recognition; (d) a voice-input unit for picking up user&apos;s natural voice command and converting the voice command into a digital voice signal; (e) a voice-recognition unit, which is capable of performing a voice recognition algorithm on the output digital voice signal from the voice-input unit to thereby recognize the voice command, and which is further capable of retrieving the remote-control code corresponding to the recognized voice command from the remote-control code database; and (f) a wireless signal emitter, which is capable of modulating the retrieved remote-control code from the remote-control code database into a wireless signal and emitting the wireless signal toward the electrical apparatuses to cause one or more of the electrical apparatuses to operate accordingly.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> together with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a standard key set <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having a subset of standard alphanumeric keys (A-Z, 0-9, and special symbols) <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and a subset of standard function keys (F1-F12) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and further includes a wireless keycode emitter <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> for emitting the keycode signals that are generated by pressing the alphanumeric keys <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and function keys <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to the PC <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and/or the TV-based Internet-access box <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Normally, the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used in conjunction with the PC <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and/or TV-based Internet-access box <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for data input purpose, and when needed, can be switched to activate the voice-control module of the invention installed in the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to perform voice-activated remote control functions on one or more of the electrical apparatuses <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> through voice activation by way of the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the wireless-keyboard based voice-control module of the invention comprises a wireless signal emitter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, a display unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, a voice-input unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, a wireless signal receiver <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, a main control unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, a voice-recognition unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, a voice-sample database <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight>, and a remote-control code database <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The voice-control module of the invention allows the user to remotely turn on/off and control the operations of one or more of the electrical apparatuses <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> through voice-activation by way of the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; i.e., the user needs just to utter a voice command against the voice-input unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the voice-control module of the invention installed in the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the voice-control module of the invention will be automatically activated to send out the corresponding remote-control code from the wireless signal emitter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to cause one or more of the electrical apparatuses <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to operate accordingly. The remote-control code can be, for example, a character string or a sequence of control code be inputted to the PC <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and/or the TV-based Internet-access box <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a remote control command to the TV set <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a remote control command to the DVD player <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a remote control command to the stereo unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, or a remote control command to the air conditioner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> For example, the user can preset the character string &ldquo;http://www.yahoo.com&rdquo; corresponding to the voice command &ldquo;yahoo&rdquo; in training mode; and afterwards, the user needs just to utter the voice command &ldquo;yahoo&rdquo; in his/her natural voice against the voice-input unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and it will cause the voice-control module of the invention installed in the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to send out the corresponding character string &ldquo;http://www.yahoo.com&rdquo; from the wireless signal emitter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to the surrounding environment, causing the Internet browser program on the PC <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and/or the TV-based Internet-access box <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to jump to the YOHOO site on the Internet. In addition, if the user wants to turn on the TV set <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, he/she needs just to utter the corresponding voice commands, such as &ldquo;TV ON&rdquo;, and it will cause the voice-control module of the invention installed in the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to remotely turn on the TV set <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. After the TV set <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is turned on, the user can further switch it to the desired channel and adjust the volume by saying, for example, &ldquo;HBO&rdquo; and &ldquo;LOUDER&rdquo;, and the voice-control module of the invention installed in the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be in the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be activated to send out the corresponding remote-control codes to cause the TV set <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> to turn to the requested channel HBO and then turn up the volume by one step. If the user wants to turn on the air conditioner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, he/she needs just to utter the corresponding voice command, such as &ldquo;AIR CONDITIONER ON&rdquo;, and it will cause the voice-control module of the invention installed in the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to remotely turn on the air conditioner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. After that, the user can further set it to the desired temperature by saying, for example, &ldquo;25 DEGREE&rdquo;, and the voice-control module of the invention installed in the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be activated to send out the corresponding remote-control code to cause the air conditioner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to set the air-conditioned temperature to 25&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> When the TV set <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or stereo unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is turned on and broadcasting a program, the broadcast sounds would degrade voice-recognition sensitivity, making the voice-control module of the invention installed in the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> unable to correctly recognize the user&apos;s voice commands at this time. As a solution to this problem, the voice-control module of the invention installed in the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is further included with an initial mute function, which is automatically activated immediately after the initialization function is activated (by pressing the CALL key <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>), and which is used to set all sound-broadcasting electrical apparatuses, such as the TV set <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the stereo unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, temporarily to mute mode. After the user&apos;s voice command input and recognition is completed, the voice-control module of the invention installed in the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will promptly send out a de-mute signal to cause the TV set <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the stereo unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to resume their original volumes. For a combined system of two or more electrical apparatuses, such as a combination system of the TV set <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the DVD player <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the voice-control module of the invention installed in the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is further capable of turning on both the TV set <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the DVD player <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at the same time by combining the two respective power-on control codes into a single code sequence to be activated by a single voice command by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The standard key set <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> on the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a subset of alphanumeric keys (A-Z, 0-9, and special symbols) <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and a subset of function keys (F1-F12) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. To facilitate the implementation of the invention, the panel of the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is further provided with a call key (CALL) <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and a voice function key (FUNC) <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The alphanumeric keys <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and the function keys <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are normally used for data input to the PC <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and/or the TV-based Internet-access box <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>; and in addition, they are employed by the invention to allow the user to perform training tasks, i.e., to preset voice commands and corresponding remote-control codes into the voice-control module of the invention. The voice function key (FUNC) <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is used in combination with the standard function keys (F1-F12) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for the training, viewing, and deleting of preset remote-control codes in the voice-control module of the invention. For example, the combination of the voice function key (FUNC) <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> with the standard F4 key allows the user to preset a voice command and its corresponding remote-control code into the voice-control module of the invention; the combination of the same with the standard F5 key allows the user to delete a preset voice command and its corresponding remote-control code from the voice-control module of the invention; and the combination of the same with the standard F6 key allows the user to view all the preset remote-control codes stored in the voice-control module of the invention, which are to be displayed on the display unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. These function key combinations are design choice and not intended to limit the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The wireless signal emitter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is preferably an infrared (IR) type that can modulate digital remote-control code into infrared signal and transmit it to the surrounding environment. The use of infrared technology allows the voice-control module of the invention to be compatible with most of the remotely-controllable electrical apparatuses in the consumer market. However, other types of wireless transmission technologies are applicable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The display unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be, for example, an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), which is used to display the alphanumeric characters representative of a preset character string or remote-control command that are inputted by the user through the alphanumeric keys <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> under training mode, for the user to verify whether his/her preset remote-control code is correct or not. In addition, the display unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be used to display operation cues and preset remote-control codes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The voice-input unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is a combined module of microphone plus analog-to-digital function, which is capable of picking up the user&apos;s natural voice command and converting it into digital voice signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The wireless signal receiver <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is preferably an infrared (IR) type for compatibility with most of the remotely-controllable electrical apparatuses in the consumer market. It is used in training mode to receive all the remote-control codes of a dedicated remote controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of a certain electrical apparatus, and then duplicate the received remote-control code and store it in the remote-control code database <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The main control unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be either a microcontroller or a specific-purpose logic circuit, which is coupled to the key set <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the wireless keycode emitter <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, the wireless signal emitter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the display unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the wireless signal receiver <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and the voice-recognition unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> for control the operations thereof and the data communications therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The voice-recognition unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is capable of performing a special voice recognition algorithm on the output digital voice signal from the voice-input unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to thereby recognize the user&apos;s voice command. The voice-recognition unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> can be either a dedicated chip or a microprocessor with built-in voice-recognition software/firmware. The voice recognition algorithm utilized by the voice-recognition unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is conventional technology, so description thereof will not be further detailed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The voice-sample database <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> and the remote-control code database <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> are both reprogrammable data storage means, such as flash memory. The voice-sample database <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> is used to store a predefined set of voice-samples that are used to compare against each user-input voice command for recognition of the voice command. The remote-control code database <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is used to store a predefined set of remote-control codes which are either factory-preset or user-preset. These remote-control codes can be preset into the voice-control module of the invention and stored in the remote-control code database <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> in two methods: (1) by directly inputting manufacturer-specified remote-control codes, which can be obtained from the manufacturers of the electrical apparatuses <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>; and (2) by duplicating the output remote-control codes from the dedicated remote controller of each of the electrical apparatuses <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. By the first method, all the remote-control codes specific to the electrical apparatuses <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are obtained from their respective manufacturers, and then each remote-control code is assigned to a unique number corresponding to a unique voice command. After this, the all the remote-control codes together with their uniquely assigned numbers are stored into the remote-control code database <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. By the second method, the voice-control module of the invention utilizes the wireless signal receiver <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to receive all the output remote-control codes from the dedicated remote controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of each of the electrical apparatuses <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and then duplicate the received remote-control codes and store them in the remote-control code database <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. These two methods are both known conventional technologies, so that details steps thereof will not be further described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The user can normally use the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for wireless data input to the PC <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and/or the TV-based Internet-access box <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and when needed, can use the CALL key <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> to activate the voice-control module of the invention installed in the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for voice-activated data input to the PC <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and/or TV-based Internet-access box <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and for voice-activated remote control of the TV-based Internet-access box <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the TV set <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, the DVD player <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the stereo unit <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and/or the air conditioner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. When the CALL key <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is pressed, it sets the voice-control module of the invention to STANDBY mode, ready to receive any voice command from the user. The use of the CALL key <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> prevents any chats or unrelated sounds to activate an unintended remote control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the user can use the voice function key (FUNC) <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> in combination of one or more of the standard function keys (F1-F12) <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to perform training, viewing, and deleting of preset remote-control codes and voice commands. For example, the combination of the voice function key (FUNC) <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> with the standard F4 key allows the user to preset a voice command and its corresponding remote-control code into the remote-control code database <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>; the combination of the same with the standard F5 key allows the user to delete a preset voice command and its corresponding remote-control code from the remote-control code database <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>; and the combination of the same with the standard F6 key allows the user to view all the preset remote-control codes and corresponding voice commands currently stored in the remote-control code database <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Under training mode, each user-defined remote-control code is displayed on the display unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for verification. The keycodes that are generated by the user pressing the alphanumeric keys <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> can be transferred to the display unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in two ways, either by providing another wireless receiver (not shown) to receive the output wireless signal from the wireless keycode emitter <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and then transferring the received keycodes to the display unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, or by internally wiring the alphanumeric keys <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to the display unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The latter scheme, however, would require modifications to the existing hardware architecture of the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As the voice-control module of the invention installed in the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is set in STANDBY mode, the user needs just to utter a voice command against the voice-input unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and it will cause the voice-control module of the invention to send out a wireless signal representative of the corresponding remote-control code from the wireless signal emitter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to cause one or more of the electrical apparatuses <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to operate accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The output digital voice signal from the voice-input unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is sent to the voice-recognition unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> where a special voice recognition algorithm is performed to compare the digital voice signal against all the voice-samples stored in the voice-sample database <highlight><bold>181</bold></highlight> to thereby determine the user&apos;s voice command. If the recognition is successful, the voice-recognition unit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> will retrieve the corresponding remote-control code (represented by RC_CODE) from the remote-control code database <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> and then transfer it via the main control unit <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to the wireless signal emitter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> At the wireless signal emitter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the remote-control code RC_CODE is modulated into an wireless signal, such as an IR signal, and then emitted outwards to the surrounding environment. Since the wireless signal emitter <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is designed to have an omni-directional capability, it allows the emitted wireless signal to be received by all of the electrical apparatuses <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> located nearby the wireless keyboard <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The wireless signal then causes one or more of the electrical apparatuses <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that are responsive to the remote-control code RC_CODE to operate accordingly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In conclusion, the invention provides a wireless-keyboard based voice-control module with display unit, which is designed specifically for installation on a wireless keyboard to allow the user to remotely control the operations of various kinds of remotely-controllable electrical apparatuses through voice activation by way of the wireless keyboard. The voice-control module of the invention is characterized by the provision of a display unit that can display the user-predefined character strings or remote-control commands in training mode for user verification. The utilization of the invention is therefore convenient and efficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described using exemplary preferred embodiments. However, it is to be understood that the scope of the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. On the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements. The scope of the claims, therefore, should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements. </paragraph>
