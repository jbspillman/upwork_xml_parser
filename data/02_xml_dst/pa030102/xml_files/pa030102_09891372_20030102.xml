In this way, referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, after the plug <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is inserted into a house-socket, the AC voltage of 120 V is transformed into a AC voltage of 28 V through a transformer <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, then is converted into a DC electric power through the AC/DC circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and then a stable DC voltage is provided through the Zener diode. At this time, if the lamp-controlling switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is pressed down, the lamp strings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will have the following variations: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> 1. When the lamp-controlling switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is pressed down the first time, the single chip <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> receives a first series of signals from the oscillator <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, all the lamp strings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are lightened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> 2. When the lamp-controlling switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is pressed down the second time, the single chip <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> receives a second series of signals from the oscillator <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, all the lamp strings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are lightened in a way as if a rotating lamp is rotated fast. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> 3. When the lamp-controlling switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is pressed down the third time, the single chip <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> receives a third series of signals from the oscillator <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, all the lamp strings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are lightened in a way as if a rotating lamp is rotated slowly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> 4. When the lamp-controlling switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is pressed down the fourth time, the single chip <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> receives a fourth series of signals from the oscillator <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, all the lamp strings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are lightened in a way of fast flashing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> 5. When the lamp-controlling switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is pressed down the fifth time, the single chip <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> receives a fifth series of signals from the oscillator <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, all the lamp strings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are lightened in a way of flashing slowly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> 6. When the lamp-controlling switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is pressed down the sixth time, the single chip <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> receives a sixth series of signals from the oscillator <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, all the lamp strings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> automatically function to go in circulations from the above second to fifth situations to continuously change the modes of lightening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> 7. When the lamp-controlling switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is pressed down the seventh time, the single chip <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> receives a seventh series of signals from the oscillator <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight>, all the lamp strings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are extinguished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The control circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the present invention can also be added with a set of radio emitter/receiver <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the push button on the radio emitter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> can completely correspond with the lamp-controlling switch <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, thereby, at any orientation within the scope (about 25 m) of the big umbrella <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, lightening can be controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> This is because that, on a prototype of the present invention, the circuit and the electric lines are arranged to be all provided in the shaft of the umbrella, this is convenient in assembling, and the electric lines will not be hooked and torn during the course of opening and collapsing the umbrella; and design of the control circuit is simple and tidy, all the lamp strings are parallelly electrically connected with one another, once one of the lamp bulbs is damaged, variations of changing of the lightening modes will not be affected. And more, the lightening can be controlled with a radio remote controlling mode, hence the present invention is more convenient for use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The structure of such a lightening umbrella is simple and tidy, it can not only get rid of the defects resided in the conventional lightening umbrella having electric lines exposed to affect collapsing and opening of the umbrella, but also can get the effects that lights thereon can vividly change in their various lightening modes. The umbrella thereby provides the effects of illumination and decoration. </paragraph>
