<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to an electronic program guide system. More particularly it relates to channel selection by means of a picture-in-picture area in an electronic program guide. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Many magazines, newspapers, and other publications have built their readership around the growing market of television (TV) viewers, who desire TV program information. Many cable TV networks have even designated a TV channel for providing the date, time and channel, at which TV programs will be presented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An expedient presentation of TV program information is obtained by an electronic program guide (EPG). In an EPG it is possible to browse, in a simple matter, a multitude of programs provided from a multitude of TV channels. An Electronic Program Guide (EPG) is an application provided in an apparatus such as an integrated receiver decoder (IRD), a set-top box (STB), or television receiver, designed to aid a viewer in the navigation of and selection from broadcast services in a digital television system. By means of the EPG it is possible to control the functionality of the apparatus, such as tuning to, or scheduling a recording of a specific service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A further facility for browsing TV programs in an EPG is a picture-in-picture (PIP) area displaying a TV program in a small part of a full screen. When the EPC is entered one area displays program information and another area displays the program watched when entering the EPG as a PIP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> By selecting another program from the EPG that program is displayed in the PIP area. It is possible to return to the last channel viewed full screen, as is described in the international publication WO9734414. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A drawback with the returning possibility described in WO9734414 is that if a user has displayed several programs in the PIP area he may only revert to the last channel viewed in full screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> When viewing programs in a PIP area of an EPG it is difficult to know when something interesting is shown in the originally shown program. Thus, another drawback with PIP in EPG is that the user risk missing something interesting in the program originally watched. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the following description, for purpose of explanation and not limitation, specific details are set forth, such as particular techniques and applications in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent for a person skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from these specific details. In other instances, detailed description of well-known methods and apparatuses are omitted so as not to obscure the description of the present invention with unnecessary details. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> An electronic program guide (EPG) system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> associated with a broadcast receiver in a broadcast system is displayed in a first display area on a display unit, such as a TV set. The EPG system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises receiving means for receiving at least one electronic program guide corresponding to the broadcast system and first display generation means for generating display of the EPG in the first display area of the associated display unit. The EPG system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> further includes a picture-in-picture (PIP) area, hereafter referred to as second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, displaying the program that was shown in full screen when the EPG was entered. The EPG has access to a history memory, hereafter referred to as storage means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that register parameters identifying programs displayed in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, such as the program that was showed in full screen when the EPG was entered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Using selecting means, such as e.g. a remote control unit (RC), selection of a new, desired program can be made from the EPG. Tuning to this program is affected by tuning means for controlling a tuner of the associated broadcast receiver to tune to the selected program. Display of this program is generated by second display generation means generating display of the selected program in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the display unit. Parameters identifying the selected program are stored in the storage means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This process may be repeated a plurality of times, wherein each program displayed in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is registered to the storage means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> To browse between the programs registered in the storage means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> selection of the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is allowed <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, e.g. by moving a cursor on the display unit or by jumping between selectable areas on the display unit using first input means, such as a remote control unit. A program, different from the one being displayed in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, is selected by pushing e.g. a &ldquo;previous program&rdquo; or &ldquo;next program&rdquo; button on the first input means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> When a desired program is displayed in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> second input means, such as an activation button can be pressed returning the system to full screen view display of the program previously displayed in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment of the present invention will next be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> This second embodiment of the present invention is identical to the first embodiment of the present invention apart from that the EPG <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a history area, hereafter referred to as third display area <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> displaying a history list of the programs registered in the storage means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and browsing the storage means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is achieved by selecting the third display area <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> was selected according to the first embodiment. When a program in the history list comprised in the storage means is activated by means of third input means this program is displayed in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. If a program is activated in the history list by means of fourth input means and already is displayed in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that program is displayed in full screen viewing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A third embodiment of the present invention will next be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> An electronic program guide (EPG) is displayed on a display unit, such as a TV set, by a EPG system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The EPG system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a picture-in-picture (PIP) area, hereafter referred to as second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> showing the program that was showed in full screen when the EPG was entered. The EPG has access to a history memory, hereafter referred to as storage means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that registers the first program displayed in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when entering the EPG. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> By selecting a sample view of a new program from the EPG, this program is displayed in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The EPG system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has access to timer means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which is activated when a program replaces the first program displayed in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> when entering the EPG. The timer means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are set to elapse in a predetermined time, preferably between 5-15 seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Sample views of programs may be displayed in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> but when the timer means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has elapsed the first program, registered in the storage means <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, is redisplayed in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this way the user need not miss out much of the initially viewed program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> If a sample view of a desired program is displayed in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, before the timer means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> has elapsed, an activation button may be pressed as fifth input means, when the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is marked <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, returning the system to full screen viewing displaying the program previously displayed in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and also resetting the timer means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> This third embodiment may be combined with the first or second embodiments providing the possibility to browse the history memory storage means by marking the second display area or third display area. Preferably, programs may be displayed in two different modes in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in either of such combined embodiments. In a first mode a sample of a program in the EPG <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be viewed in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> activating the timer means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> as described above. In a second mode the program may be viewed in the second display area <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> without activating the timer means <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The choice between the two different modes is preferably obtained by displaying to the user of the EPG a message when a program is selected in the EPG, which message gives two selectable choices: sample view on or sample view off, or alternatively timer on or timer off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The electronic program guide system described above may be incorporated in e.g. an integrated receiver decoder, a set-top box, a mobile handset, a television receiver or a mobile display appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be implemented as a computer program product stored on a computer readable storage medium, comprising computer readable program code means for causing a computer to perform the features described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Such a computer program product may be directly loadable into the internal memory of a digital computer comprising software code portions for performing the features described above when said product is run on a computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It will be obvious that the present invention may be varied in a plurality of ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the scope of the present invention. All such variations as would be obvious for a person skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
