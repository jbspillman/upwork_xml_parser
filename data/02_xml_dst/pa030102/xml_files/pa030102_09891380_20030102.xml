<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In the following description, for purpose of explanation and not limitation, specific details are set forth, such as particular techniques and applications in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent for a person skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from these specific details. In other instances, detailed description of well-known methods and apparatuses are omitted so as not to obscure the description of the present invention with unnecessary details. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A multimedia system, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, comprises an electronic program guide system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> e.g. incorporated in an integrated receiver decoder, a user input means <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, such as a remote control, and a display device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, such as a TV set. The electronic program guide system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a receiving means <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, such as a tuner/receiver, a recording device <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, such as a hard disk, an electronic program guide (EPG) memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and a control device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> including a communications means, such as a network modem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The electronic program guide system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is controlled by the remote control <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The remote control <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may further control the TV set <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The tuner/receiver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> receives broadcast programs, e.g. broadcast via cable, terrestrial or satellite, which programs may be watched on the TV set <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and/or recorded on the hard disk <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The tuner/receiver <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> further receives updates for the EPG, which are transferred to the EPG memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, regularly or upon request </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the EPG displays available programs from available TV channels or own compositions, i.e. virtual channels, on the TV set <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The EPG is browsed <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to find a program of interest, which program then is selected <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The selected program may be personally used <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as displayed on the TV set <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or recorded on the hard disk <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. It is further possible to set a reminder that displays a message on the TV set <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> at a predetermined time, e.g. a couple of minutes, before the program starts or sends an alert message, in the form of an SMS (SMS, short message service), to a mobile telephone a predetermined time, e.g. at least ten minutes, before the program starts. An alert message is of small size and easily fit into an SMS. A reminder may alternatively be sent both to the TV <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and to a mobile telephone (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A notification of the selected program in the EPG may alternatively <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> be transmitted to one or more persons, such as a friend or a multitude of friends, i.e. to their respective electronic program guide system. The friend or friends that the user want to notify are selected <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, either in response to a message displayed on the TV set <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> or by activation of a dedicated button. If the user wants to recommend recording <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> a recoding flag is set <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the notification. If the user also wants to recommend reminder <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> a reminder flag is set <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the notification. When the user does not want to recommend recording <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at least the reminder flag is set <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, i.e. when recommend recording <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is dropped a reminder flag is set <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Further, if the user wants to send an alert message <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the friend or friends an alert flag is set <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the notification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The notification is thereafter coded and transmitted <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, by the network modem of the control device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, to the electronic program guide system(s) of the friend(s). The transfer of the notification is accomplished with a particular protocol that conforms to TCP/IP (TCP/IP, transmission control protocol/internet protocol). Thus, the notification contains indications for a reminder to a program, a record instruction for a program, or both a reminder and a record instruction for a program, and optionally an alert message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The control device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of the electronic program guide system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> further includes reception means, such as a filter. The filter is set to pass only notifications from certain friends, authorized by e.g. a certificate. Different friends may have different access levels, defined by the authorization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a notification is received <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the electronic program guide system <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by the network modem of the control device <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and decoded. If the notification is not from an authorized friend <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> it is discarded <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. If the notification is authorized it is checked <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> if it contains a mobile alert flag set. When an alert flag is set it is checked <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> if the friend is authorized to send an alert message to a mobile phone of the user. If so, an alert message is sent <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to the mobile phone by SMS as described above. If not, and also if no mobile alert flag is set, it is checked <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> if a recording flag is set. When a recording flag is set it is checked <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> if the friend is authorized to register a recording. If the friend is authorized, the recording is registered in the EPG memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. This may be valuable when the user is away from home, e.g. on holiday, to allow a friend to look after interesting programs. If the present recording registration is in conflict with a previous recording instruction the previous recording instruction is transferred to a reminder. If the user is not authorized to register a recording instruction, the instruction is delayed <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> until the user either confirms or cancels that recording instruction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Lastly, it is checked <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> if a reminder flag is set. If no reminder flag is set management of the notification is ended <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. If a reminder flag is set it is checked <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> if the notification is authorized to set a reminder. If the notification is authorized the reminder is registered <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> into the EPG memory <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and then management of the notification is ended <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. If the notification is not authorized to register a reminder the reminder registration is delayed <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> until the user either confirms or cancels that reminder registration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment of the present invention will next be described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The second embodiment is identical to the first embodiment except for the differences mentioned below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The electronic program guide system may be incorporated in a set-top box, a mobile handset, a television receiver or a mobile display appliance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The alert flag in the notification may be in forms closely related to SMS, such as EMS (EMS, enhanced messaging service), or other mobile messaging systems such as MMS (MMS, multimedia messaging service) or in the form of an electronic mail to the mobile phone or other email address. The alert flag in the notification may alternatively be replaced by an alert message transmitted directly to a mobile phone of the friend or friends, e.g. by SMS, MMS, EMS or electronic mail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> When an alert message is transmitted directly to the mobile phone or other email address of the friend or friends a reminder or recording notification is always also transmitted to the electronic program guide system of the friend or friends, such that the user of that electronic program guide system need not note down nor remember reminding/recording parameters, such as TV channel, start and stop times for the recommended program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The particular protocol for transmitting the notification may be replaced by regular electronic mail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The prompt message waiting for delayed confirmation of recording instruction or reminder registration may be transmitted to a mobile telephone of the user, e.g. as an SMS or electronic mail. The user may then send a message back accepting or canceling the record instruction or reminder registration. A canceled record instruction for a program results in a reminder for that program. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> A record instruction, both for a multimedia system of a user and for a multimedia system of a friend of the user, which is in conflict with a previous record instruction may, display a message indicating the previous record instruction and the present record instruction. The user is then given the possibility to either overwrite the previous record instruction or to cancel the present record instruction. If the user chooses to overwrite the previous record instruction it is preferably transformed into a reminder If the user chooses to cancel the present record instruction it is preferably transformed into a reminder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be implemented as a computer program product stored on a computer readable storage medium, comprising computer readable program code means for causing a computer to perform the features described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Such a computer program product may be directly loadable into the internal memory of a digital computer comprising software code portions for performing the features described above when said product is run on a computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It will be obvious that the present invention may be varied in a plurality of ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as departure from the scope of the present invention. All such variations as would be obvious for a person skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
