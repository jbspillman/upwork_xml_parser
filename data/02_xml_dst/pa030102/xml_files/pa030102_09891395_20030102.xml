<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to removable hurricane storm shutters, to protect a window during a storm from wind and flying debris. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The use of storm shutters to protect a window during a storm is well known in the prior art. Typically, these shutters may consist of a precut portion of material such as plywood, attached to the outer frame of a window. These panels may be attached to the outer window frame by hinges, nails or screws, or by use of a bracket assembly mounted to the outer window frame allowing the storm shutter to be slid into place. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Hurricane storm shutters must be precut to fit individual windows. This requires that each window on a house be measured and a storm shutter cut to fit that particular window. Thus, these storm shutters are not interchangeable between windows of different sizes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In addition, the process of cutting and measuring storm shutters to fit a window can take a considerable amount of time. This may be of particular concern to a home owner with little or no advanced warning of an approaching storm. In the case of plywood storm shutters that are attached by means of nails or screws, there is also the problem of damage to the outer window frame from repeatedly nailing or screwing the storm shutters into place. One method of expediting the process of putting storm shutters in place is the use of corrugated plastic shutters that are precut for each individual window. These shutters are held in place by means of brackets on the upper and lower portion of the window frame. This type of system facilitates the quick placement and removal of each shutter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> These plastic shutters are lightweight and easily stored. However, each shutter must be precut to match the dimensions of the particular window it is to cover. In the case where there is a limited amount of time to prepare a house for a storm, the time necessary to precut each shutter for each window may create a problem. Further, when each shutter has been precut for an individual window, the shutters must be sorted and matched to each window on the house prior to installation, thus consuming additional time that may be critical during the period prior to a storm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> This invention provides an apparatus and method for protecting a window during a storm using interchangeable storm shutters. The shutters used to protect a particular window are made up of a series of interlocking panel sections of a predetermined width. A first panel section would be placed in a window and a second panel section, slidably connected to the first panel section by a telescopic connection, would be extended along a longitudinal axis to the appropriate window height to cover an exposed area of the window. The next storm shutter also comprised of the first and second telescoping panel sections would be extended to the window height, put in place, and interlocked with the previously installed storm shutter. This process would continue until the entire exposed area of the window has been covered. Thus, the apparatus and method of this invention allows for the placement of interchangeable storm shutters in the windows of a house prior to a storm. Further, the apparatus and method of this invention reduce the time necessary to prepare a house for a storm, in that these shutters may be obtained and put in place without having to be precut for each individual window. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In addition, the storm shutters of the prior art typically do not allow light to pass through the window into the house. Thus, in the event of a power outage the occupants of the house may be in total darkness during a daytime storm. The apparatus and method of the current invention takes advantage of a translucent plastic material that would allow light to pass through the shutters and thus maintain illumination in the house during daylight hours in the event of a power outage. Lastly, the apparatus and method of this invention allow for easier removal and storage because the panel sections can be removed and stacked in a pile of a uniform dimension and without regard to the order or location of the windows from which they were removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> These and other features and advantages of this invention are described in or are apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a typical window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that may be protected by the storm shutters of the present invention. The storm shutter is designed to protect the entire area of the window. The window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a height <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a width <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which can be divided into three window pane widths <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. While one particular type of window is illustrated, the invention is applicable to any window of any size, shape and orientation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is an exemplary embodiment of three storm shutters interlocked together. The first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is slidably connected to the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to form the removable storm shutter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Each storm shutter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has two longitudinal edges. The first and second panels <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> preferably are telescopically interconnected to allow extension of the second panel relative to the first panel to adjust the length of the storm shutter to the window height <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The first and second panels <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, preferably have a width that matches the window pane width <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Those skilled in the art recognize that the width of the storm shutter may vary and is not limited to the window pane width. In addition, those skilled in the art recognize that the telescopic interconnection of the first and second panels results in an overlap of the first panel over the second panel (or vice versa), thus defining an overlap edge <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> between the first and second panels. While the invention has been described in terms of extending the length of the panels to cover the window vertical length <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, those skilled in the art appreciate that the panels can be extended horizontally to cover the width <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the window. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be corrugated and may be of a translucent or transparent material such as a clear structural plastic. One such material is sold under the tradename Lexan&trade;. Other structural materials, such as metal or wood, could be substituted. However, these may not achieve the advantage of allowing light through the shutters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The first panel has a longitudinal axis and transverse axis. The second panel also has a longitudinal axis and transverse axis and is slidably connected to the first panel by a slidable connection for relative movement along one of the longitudinal axis and transverse axis. The second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be fixed in relation to the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at a predetermined interval by a retainer. The predetermined interval corresponds to an area of the window to be protected by the storm shutter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is an exemplary embodiment of the storm shutters of this invention having the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> slidably retracted in relation to the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be slidably retracted or extended in relation to the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to facilitate installation and removal in a window to be protected. The retraction or extension of the first panel relative to the second panel also allows the storm shutter to be adjusted to the height of a differently sized window. In addition, the first panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be extended to cover the top or bottom portion of a window. When the first and second panels are fully retracted such that the first and second panels completely overlap, they form a storm shutter of uniform size that can be easily stacked and stored. When needed for the next storm, any storm shutter can be extracted from the stock and adjusted in size to cover any window. Therefore, storm shutters of the invention need not be designated for a particular window. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, three storm shutters are interlocked together to form an integral unit to cover the area of one window. Each storm shutter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has two longitudinal edges <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. One edge or both edges <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> may interlock with an edge of an adjacent storm shutter. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that multiple storm shutters may be interlocked together to cover a window having any window width <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In addition, those skilled in the art recognize that the first and second panels can be formed of a predetermined uniform size, and then assembled together to form a shutter, with adjacent shutters interlocked at their edges. to cover a window of any size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the exemplary storm shutters according to this invention installed in a typical window. Brackets <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in the upper and lower window sills retain the interlocking storm shutters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in the window at the top and bottom portions. Other embodiments may utilize brackets to retain the shutters on the vertical sides of the windows. Still other embodiments may utilize brackets to retain the shutter on all four sides of the window. In addition to retaining the shutters in the window, brackets <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> facilitate the installation and removal of the individual shutters in the window by creating a tract for each shutter to slide into and out of place. The brackets <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may be removably installed in the upper and lower portions of the outer frame of the window, or they may be permanently affixed in a manner that retains the aesthetic appearance of the window frame. The first and second panels <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be placed in the window brackets and extended slidably in relation to one another to fit in the window height, or they may be extended prior to placement in the window brackets <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Other embodiments may use quick tapping screws, bolts, or threaded rods with wing nuts in lieu of brackets <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to retain the inner locking storm shutters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in the window at the top and bottom portions, or on all four sides. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is an embodiment of a retainer for fixing the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in relation to the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The retainer has a plug <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> that is slidably mounted in a hole in the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> also contains a recess <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> in the vicinity of the hole for housing the end of the plug when the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is moved laterally in relation to the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The plug <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> engages a recess <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> in the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at the location that corresponds to the overall length of the shutter as it is to be installed in the window. The plug <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> engages the recess <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> in the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> due to the force exerted by an urging member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. This urging member <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> may be a helical spring or other such member capable of urging the plug <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> into the recess <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> of the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. To disengage the retainer, the plug <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is moved in the opposite direction out of the recess <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> of the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, thus freeing the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to move in relation to the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. While only one recess <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> is shown, several recesses may be aligned in a column and spaced at predetermined intervals to allow the first and second panels to be extended to any one of a plurality of lengths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is another embodiment of a retainer to affix the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in relation to the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. A bolt <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> inserts through a corresponding hole in the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The bolt <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is retained in place by a circular nut <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> that is threaded on to the bolt from the opposite side. The circular nut <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> has ridges on the outside peripheral edge to facilitate hand tightening and removal. The bolt <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> also has ridges to facilitate hand tightening and removal. When assembling the storm shutter, the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> would be adjusted to the proper height for placement in the window. The bolt <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> would then be placed through the corresponding hole in the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> exposing the threaded portion of the bolt <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> on the opposite end. The circular washer <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> would then be threaded on to the bolt, thus fixing the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in relation to the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. This process would be reversed to disassemble the storm shutter. Several holes can be aligned in a column and spaced at predetermined intervals. Other embodiments may use wing nuts in place of the circular nut <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Other retainers are available for use in the invention. For example, one panel may include an integral projecting and flexible ratchet arm, which engages one of a plurality of recesses in the other panel. When the panels slide in the extension direction under a relatively weak pulling force, the ratchet arm bends to enter and exit each recess. However, in the retroaction direction, the ratchet arm abuts a wall of the recess thereby maintaining the extended length of the shutter. A relatively strong compressive force would be necessary to force the arm to bend and exit the recess, thereby allowing the shutter to retract in size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is an embodiment of an interlocking mechanism for joining two sections of a storm shutter together. A retaining channel <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> runs longitudinally on both the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The channel <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is an integral part of both the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. On the opposite end of the panels from the retaining channel <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is a male connector <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> which also runs longitudinally on both the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The male connector <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is inserted in the retaining channel <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to interlock two storm shutters together. The male connector <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> is retained in the retaining channel <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with the assistance of an interference fit between the outer portion of the male connector <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and the inner portion of the retaining channel <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Other embodiments may utilize bolts and wing nuts fitted in corresponding holes in the male connector <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> and retaining channel <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to retain two storm shutters in the interlocked position. The panel sections <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be interlocked together prior to being installed in the window or may be interlocked during installation by sliding successive storm shutters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> into the retaining brackets and applying force to the opposite ends of the storm shutters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The storm shutters <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be taken apart by applying force in the opposite direction thus removing the male connector <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> from the retaining channel <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is an embodiment of a slidable connection between the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The slidable connection has a male connector <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that is an integral part of the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> which fits into a retaining cavity <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> which is an integral part of the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The male connector <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> runs longitudinally the full length of the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The retaining cavity <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> also runs the full length of the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The slidable connection operates such that the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be extended or retracted in relation to the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> while maintaining the structural integrity of the entire storm shutter <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The slidable connection operates such that the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may move freely longitudinally in relation to the first panel <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments this connection may be used repeatedly for additional panel sections such that they may extend telescopically to cover a designated window area. Further, the male connector <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the retaining cavity <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be placed at varying longitudinal locations on the panels <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is an embodiment of a threaded rod <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> that is installed in a window frame <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. The threaded rod <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is maintained in the window frame <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> by an interference fit in the corresponding window frame hole <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The threaded rod <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may be permanently or removably affixed to the window frame <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. Once the threaded rod <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is in place, the second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the storm shutter of this invention is mounted on the threaded rod <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> through a retaining hole <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. The second panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is then retained on the threaded rod <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> by a wing nut <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. This arrangement allows for the quick installation of the storm shutters of this invention without the use of brackets. When the storm shutters are to be removed the wing nut <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is removed from the threaded rod <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> allowing the panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to slide out of place. The threaded rod <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may be removed or may be left in place in the window frame <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> for future use. Those skilled in the art will recognize that this embodiment may be used to retain the storm shutters of this invention at various locations on a window frame to facilitate a tight and secure fit over the entire window. </paragraph>
