<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A device for killing pathogens that grow on the surface of the evaporator coil within a conventional air conditioner and in the drip pan of its evaporator. Utilizing ultraviolet radiation which is well-known to kill a wide range of pathogens, the device comprises of at least one elongated ultraviolet light source. This source is positioned in such a way that its light strikes both the evaporator and the drip pan. Also this source is mounted transversely to the flow path of air passing through the evaporator. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The evaporation coil in a central air conditioning system is a ideal location for bacteria and other microorganisms to grow. Some of them are pathogens while other just add a foul smell to the air. Moisture in the air, which tends to condense on the cool surface of the evaporator coil, is usually captured in a drip pan which is not only equipped with a drain but also designed so that the air flowing past the evaporator coil picks up moisture accumulated in the pan. Notwithstanding these features, the pan does retain a certain amount of water. Conditions are such that microorganisms present in the incoming air may lodge and grow in the moist pan and on the coil surface. There is always the chance that bacteria, viruses, yeast mold, mildew and their various spores will get into the air stream flowing past the evaporator coil and its drip pan. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The object of this invention is to provide a means for irradiating, with ultraviolet light, surfaces of the evaporator coil and drip pan in such a way to both kill and prevent any buildup of pathogens thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the irradiating means comprises an elongated ultraviolet lamp which is mounted centrally relative to the evaporator coil surfaces, so that its light strikes them, and transversely to the flow path of the air as it passes through the evaporator. Shielding the lamp is a quartz tube which envelopes it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, one end of the quartz tube is secured, using a sleeve which projects perpendicularly from a flat base, to a sidewall of a sheet metal container surrounding the evaporator coil shell. Slip-fitted into the outwardly protruding sleeve, the quartz tube extends into the shell itself through concentric holes formed in it and in the sidewall. These holes measure, by way of example, 1 inch and 3 inches in diameter, respectively. In a conventional &ldquo;A&rdquo; frame-type evaporator coil, the quartz tube, with the ultraviolet lamp inserted therewith in, is positioned midway between the legs of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; frame.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the drawings, a device for purification the air as it passes through the evaporator coil of an air conditioner is indicated generally by the reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises an ultraviolet light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> enclosed in a quartz tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> mounted within an air conditioner <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> near its evaporator coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. For a typical &ldquo;A&rdquo; frame-type evaporator coil, the ultraviolet lamp <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is disposed above the drip pan <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and midway between the legs of the coil (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To install the ultraviolet lamp <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, one cuts two concentric holes: a hole <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> in the sidewall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of a sheet metal container surrounding the shell <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the evaporator coil <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a smaller concentric hole (not shown) is cut in the shell itself. Mounting screws <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are used to attach a base <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> holding the quartz tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the sidewall <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). A small rubber cushion <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is inserted into quartz tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> just ahead of the ultraviolet lamp <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG.1</cross-reference>). Holding the quartz tube <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the light source <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in assembled relation and the latter in electrical contact with its power supply <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a cap <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and its mating surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> affixed to the quartz tube. Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</cross-reference> are the high and low pressure evaporator connections <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the drip pan drain <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is understood that those skilled in the art may conceive other applications, modifications and/or changes in the invention described above. Any such applications, modifications or changes which fall within the purview of the description are intended to be illustrative and not intended to be limitative.
