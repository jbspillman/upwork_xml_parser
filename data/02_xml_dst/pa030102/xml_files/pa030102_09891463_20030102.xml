<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains to system testing. More particularly, the present invention pertains to a headerless interconnect that permit coupling test equipment to a microprocessor or other complex semiconductor circuitry incorporated in silicon chips contained in a system or platform without a connector present on the platform under test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> There are numerous testing schemes for carrying out a system or platform testing available in the art. For example, the IEEE 1149.1 (Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) 1990), provides such a testing system. In a JTAG system, as with other testing systems, the system, which contains circuits, typically on chips, to be tested must be coupled to a testing system. This is typically done in the manner illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>. The traces, in the form of a JTAG bus coupled to circuits to be tested, are on a motherboard or baseboard <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A header <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is soldered to the board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. For example, this may be a 2 mm. header with two rows of 13 pins. A JTAG probe <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> having a matching 2 mm. receptacle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, plugs into the header when it is desired to do testing. In conventional fashion, probe <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> contains circuits such as buffers and clock drivers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> JTAG probe <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has a connector <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> at its side opposite receptacle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A JTAG cable <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> with a plug <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> on its end plugs into this connector, and makes a connection with the host which is carrying out the testing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This arrangement has a number of disadvantages. The socket receptacles in <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> often become weak and do not make adequate connection with pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> due to frequent detachment/attachment. Furthermore, the header provides inadequate support when the board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is placed in different orientations. For example, if the board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is turned to be vertical, the receptacle <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can become disconnected or make marginal connection with pins <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> because there is no retention mechanism other than the frictional force of the socket receptacles. Even if the board remains fixed, the probe and cable tend to overstress the pins of the header. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is also the case that the header <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is removed after the development of a product. As a result, it is not available for testing during manufacturing or for maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In view of the problems set forth above, there is a need for a way to establish contact with the bus which couples to circuits to be tested that is inexpensive, reliable and which can be used beyond the development stage.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the &ldquo;zero connection&rdquo; arrangement of the present invention completely avoid the need for a target probe header on the unit under test (UUT) or motherboard. The connector is replaced by test pads which may be like surface mount technology (SMT) pads or any of the types of test point (5) currently in use. The present invention will be explained using JTAG as an example. It should be recognized that this is only by way of example, and that the zero connection system of the present invention is generally applicable when temporary contact with circuits, for example on a board, must be made for testing or other purposes. For example, embodiments of the present invention are useful in carrying out system or platform diagnostics. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the JTAG header is replaced by using a modified JTAG probe that incorporates test probes and, in one embodiment, retention clips integral to the JTAG device. The term &ldquo;zero connection&rdquo; refers to the complete elimination of the header on the motherboard. It can also be referred to as a headerless connection. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, only the JTAG test pads need to be incorporated on the motherboard or UUT. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the JTAG zero connection provide a new method of connecting to the JTAG maintenance and debug port on PC boards. This method eliminates the existing JTAG header which is soldered to the PC board during development. More generally, the method is one for testing circuits on one or more chips mounted to one or more printed circuit boards in the unit under test. Instead of mounting a header for making connections, a regular pattern of test pads, i.e., contact points are formed on the printed circuit board coupled to traces from a test bus leading to circuits to be tested. To carry out testing, the contact points are contacted with a plurality of spring loaded contacts, supported in a pattern which is the same as the pattern of contact points on the printed circuit board. The spring loaded contacts are then coupled to test equipment for testing the circuits, e.g., JTAG test equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment alignment guides are formed on the printed circuit board adjacent to the pattern and the method includes aligning the plurality of spring loaded contacts using the alignment guides. In the illustrated method, coupling the spring loaded contacts to test equipment is via a test probe. Other aspects of this method will be evident from the discussion of illustrated embodiment below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference> is a front elevation view and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> is a side elevation view of an embodiment of the zero connection arrangement of the present invention. Parts that are the same as those in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> are given the same reference numerals. On the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, instead of a header, are a plurality of contact points <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, equal in number to the pins in the header being replaced. These may be of the nature of any conventionally used test points or may be, for example, SMT pads. In the illustrated embodiment, three holes <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> are provided as the alignment guides. Hole <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> is on one side of the contact area footprint <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and holes <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> on the other side. They are placed in predetermined alignment with the contact points <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and provide a means of alignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The test probe printed circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is enclosed in a probe housing <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. In place of the receptacle on the probe printed circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is a double ended probe assembly <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to be described in more detail below. Replacement is accomplished without impact to electronics on the probe printed circuit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Also provided in the probe housing <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is a probe retention mechanism adaptable for various substrate thickness. In the illustrated embodiment this mechanism comprises three crossing spring clips <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> adapted to be inserted in the holes <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> on the substrate, e.g., printed circuit board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, to hold the probe assembly <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> firmly in contact with the contact points <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The elements making up the double ended probe assembly in the illustrated embodiment include a connector <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> at the end of board <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> opposite connector <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment these connectors may be identical, for example, AMP Mictor Microstrip 40 Position connectors. Obviously this particular connector is not required; any connector with the necessary number of pins for the particular testing application may be used. A transition printed circuit board <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> interfaces, on one side with connector <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and on the other side has a pattern of contacts identical to those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> which are on the board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In between board <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a spring loaded pin assembly <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight>, shown in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3</cross-reference>B. This assembly is made up of a retaining block <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> and a plurality of pins <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. The pattern of the pins is identical to the pattern of contacts <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference>. In this embodiment, the pins <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> are spring loaded on both ends. The block <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is rigidly retained in the housing <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> with the tops of pins <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> pressed into contact with the contacts on the bottom of the transition printed circuit board <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>, the probe is shown attached to the printed circuit board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by means of the crossing spring clips <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> which provide a robust coupling. Although this is a particularly good way to make the connection, other attachment arrangements may be used. In this embodiment the use of three attachment points insures proper alignment of the pins <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> with the contact points <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the zero connection arrangement of the present invention provide a number of advantages. There is no cost to the printed circuit board during production. The arrangement makes it possible to provide a more mechanically stable connection to the printed circuit board, for example by using the double spring clips. Furthermore the debug port established by the contacts in footprint <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> allows testing during production testing and fault isolation and, in addition allows for OEM field service use. In addition embodiments of the present invention provide for better signal quality than the existing connection method. Due to the degradation of contact integrity on existing 2 mm. interface connector to unit under test and from lack of support of the probe during testing the female contacts &ldquo;open&rdquo; up and do not provide consistent contact integrity over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Specific embodiment of the present invention have been illustrated and described. However, numerous adaptations within the spirit of the invention are possible. For example, the substrate of board <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> could be lengthened to provide a mounting solution to be integrated for the probe assembly. It would be further possible to incorporate the retention mechanism into the probe assembly as well making the probes and retention solution all replaceable as one assembly mounted to the JTAG substrate without changing any electrical of the substrate. The lengthened substrate that supports the probe assembly could also be used for signal conditioning on the far side of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Also a modified &ldquo;stabber&rdquo; probe using the technology of the present invention could be implemented for functional testing. For a method carrying out functional testing in a &ldquo;stabber&rdquo; test fixture, retention would not be needed, however, alignment of the probe would be through tapered or stepped guide pin registration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Thus, although several embodiments are specifically illustrated and described herein, it will be appreciated that modifications and variations of the present invention are covered by the above teachings and within the purview of the appended claims without departing from the spirit and intended scope of the invention. </paragraph>
