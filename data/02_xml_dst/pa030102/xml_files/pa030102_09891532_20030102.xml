<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> A. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a golf collimator which is used so as to ascertain a straight direction when holding a golf club at the ready; and a golf club fitted with such a collimator </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> B. Background Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In a golf competition, a way to a good score is to ascertain a straight direction without a tee feeling when holding a golf club at the ready. If it becomes possible to ascertain a straight direction without a tense feeling also in a usual practice, it becomes possible to ascertain a straight direction without a tense feeling even when going into the competition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When a golf player holds a golf club at the ready, he or she usually repeats a process including the steps of: firstly ascertaining a direction in which he or she wants to hit a golf ball (a front direction); and then staring at a club head, and then staring into the front direction by turning his or her eyes from the club head to the front direction; and then restaring at the club head. As is often the case with this process, in proportion as this process is repeated in order to ascertain a straight direction a tense feeling gradually rises to accumulate the strain in arms and hands, resulting in hitting the ball in an unexpected direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> By the way, according to the knowledge of sports psychology, when looking at a thing, man intrinsically tends to conceptually grasp the thing and to establish an image of the thing on the basis of the man&apos;s empirical knowledge. So, in the natural environment where there are few straight lines like in a golf field, a player tries to image a straight line through an accumulation of negative presumptions that this is not a straight line and neither is this. Then, this work for establishing an image of a straight line is performed by the subtle function of both eyes, but the established image of a straight line varies according to days and times. Because of the occurrence of such a phenomenon, the golf player&apos;s work for ascertaining a straight line brings him or her a still tense feeling. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows one mode for carrying out a golf collimator of the present invention. The golf collimator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a board to be fixed to the upper side of a club head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>showed in a two-dotted chain line in a figure. As everybody knows, a club head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>was fixed at the tip of a club shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>shown in a two-dotted chain line in a figure. The attachment of a board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on a head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is possible by such a variety of ways as is to stick a board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the upper side of a head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>through a both-sided adhesive tapes (omitted in a figure) which are stuck on the back side of a board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, or to screw a board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on a head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>whereon tapped holes (omitted in a figure) are established. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fitted with a linear plane ll, ll and a notch wherein the linear planes are located on the right and the left of a side of the board which will look toward a front (a direction showed by S in a figure) when a board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is fixed on a head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and wherein the notch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is formed backward between the linear plane ll and ll. A recess of the notch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is of such a concave shape as is open in a direction which will be the front S when holding a club at the ready, and wherein the innermost of the recess is located almost at the widthways center, and wherein three points <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are drawn at three positions both on the upper side of the board <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and around the notch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of he recess, that is, at the back and on the right and the left of the recess respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A golf collimator of the present invention can be a sheet made from paper or plastic. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows such a golf collimator <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is a sheet to be fixed on a head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>easily because the back side of the sheet is adhesive or suck whereon lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are drawn on a side of the sheet which will look toward a front when the sheet is fixed on a head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The lines <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>l are composed of a straight line part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>l<highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the right and the left part of the lines respectively, and a curved line part which is formed by a central part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>curved backward. The concave curved line part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>forms one recess <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which is of such a concave shape as is open in a direction which will be front when holding a club at the ready, and the innermost <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the recess is located almost at the widthways center. Three points <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are drawn at three positions around a recess <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is formed by a concave curved line part <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the lines <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, that is, at the back and on the right and on the left of the recess respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows one mode for carrying out the present invention of a golf club with a golf collimator. The mode is applied to a putter, but a golf club therewith of the present invention can be also applied to an iron or a wood. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A putter <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is fitted with the following structure for a collimator on the head fixed at the tip of a shaft <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the putter. That is, the collimator structure comprises a recess <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and three points <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> arranged around the recess <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. A recess <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is of such a concave shape as is formed by engraving on the upper side of a head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>or such and as is open in a direction which will be a front S when a player overlooks a head and holds a club at the ready, and wherein the innermost <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the recess is located almost at the widthways center of the recess. The three points <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are arranged at the back and on the right and the left of the recess <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The function of the above collimator structure of the present invention is described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> When a player holds a golf club with the collimator structure of the present invention at the ready and overlooks a head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with his or her eyes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), he or she can look at a recess <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) and three points <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) on a club head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>). A player can concentrate his or her attention on the upper side of a head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>easily by looking at three points <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) However, because there are three points and the three points scatter a player&apos;s sight, it does not lead the circumstance that a player fixes his or her eyes <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on a head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. That is, the viewpoint of seeing a thing does not focus on a single point hard focus), but comes to cover a slightly wide area (soft focus). As a result, three points <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) works to make a player concentrate his or her attention on a head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at ease. Otherwise, if there were a single point, a player cannot have such an ease feeling, and is forced to have a tense feeling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When a player looks in a direction of a front S with concentrating his or her attention without a tense feeling, a collimator structure directs his or her eyes toward a direction which an opening of a recess <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) is extended to, wherein the recess is surrounded by three points <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>), and wherein the opening of the recess will look toward a front S. Therefore, such an extension of eyes of a player enables him or her to adjust a hitting face to a front direction both easily and accurately. That is, a collimator structure enables a player to ascertain a straight direction without a tense feeling, and to adjust a hitting face to the front direction. Furthermore, a collimator structure of the present invention remarkably increases the accuracy of ascertaining a straight direction, because an opening of a recess <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which will look toward a front S, has the width w and makes a player to ascertain a direction of a front S by means of not a simply single line, but a band with the width of w. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> When a player is in the above circumstance, he or she assumes naturally as if another point <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which is shown by a dotted line in a figure in front of the tree points <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) of the collimator structure, has existed actually. Therefore, putting a golf ball (not shown in a figure) on the point <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> enables a player to roll or hit a golf ball easily along the image of a straight line ascertained through the above process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the above example, an opening of a recess <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>), which will look toward a front S, has a linear part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) on the right and the left of an opening of a recess respectively, and the linear part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) lies along a hitting face of a head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Therefore, in this point a collimator structure also makes it easy and accurate to adjust a hitting face of a head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to a front S by ascertaining a straight direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> According to the knowledge of the present inventor, some have a right dominant eye, and the others have a left dominant eye. In principle, man usually looks at a thing by means of a man&apos;s dominant eye. The strength of a man&apos;s dominant eye not only varies subtly according to days and times, also a man&apos;s dominant eye sometimes becomes the other eye. This causes the change of the image of a straight line described in the beginning. Therefore, if in order to correct a function of a man&apos;s dominant eye the innermost <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) of the recess l<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) is made eccentric from the widthways center C only by a minute distance (a preferable distance is from 1 to 5 mm) as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it becomes possible to correct the above-mentioned image of a straight line ascertained by a man&apos;s dominant eye In case of a right-handed player, the deviation of the innermost is better performed for a player with a right dominant eye in a downward direction as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, on the other hand the deviation of the innermost is better performed for a player with a left dominant eye in a upward direction as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. On the contrary, in case of a left-handed player, the deviation of the innermost is better performed for a player with a right dominant eye in a upward direction as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, on the other hand the deviation of the inmost is better performed for a player with a left dominant eye in a downward direction as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the correction function is shown by means of making the innermost of a recess eccentric either right or left. In addition, as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, it is also possible to show the similar correction function by making a point <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>), located at the back of a recess <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, eccentric slightly either right or left from the backward center C centered between two points on the right and the left. However, it is most preferred that the correction function is shown by combing the deviation of the position of the innermost with the deviation of a point at the back of a recess. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As the above result, the collator structure of the present invention works so that a player can lower his or her score easily According to the result of the experiment in which beginners, average level of players, and veterans used the golf collimator and the golf club therewith, they were able to lower their score by one to five on the average per ten batted balls in a putting practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In any example of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a recess <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) is fitted with a linear part <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) on the right and on the left of an opening of the recess respectively These linear parts work to make it easy to adjust a hitting face <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of a head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to a front S because of the existence of the linear parts. However, a collimator structure of the present invention does not necessarily require the linear parts. That is to say, for example, as is drawn by printing or sum on the upper side of a head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the collimator structure may be a structure that an arc of circle <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> having the notch of about <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> degree is drawn in the region surrounded by three points <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>), thereby taking the resultant notch <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of a triangle shape as the aforementioned recess, and that there is no rectilinear part on he right and the left of the opening of this recess <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A line drawn for a recess <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) is a continuous line in example. However, as long as a recess can be imaged, a line drawn for a recess <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be discontinuous like a dashed line. A recess may be drawn by printing or such, or may be formed in such a shape as is hollowed or swelling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Three points <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) are essential to a collimator structure of the present invention. However, as long as two points an the right and the left are located on a line lying along a hitting face <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>of a head <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>and as long as a central point is arranged to be located almost at the back of the center between two points, a depth position of a central point may be shallow or deep. In case where a focus of eyes is adjusted to a head by using the effect of three points on easing stare of eyes as described in the above, the degree of easing focal stare can be adjusted by alter tie depth degree of the depth position of a central point. In this case, a central point may be kept apart back from the innermost of a recess. On the contrary, two points on the right and the left of a recess may be located further forward around a recess, that is, two points <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) may be projected slightly from the position of a front edge of a recess <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, or two points on the right and the left of a recess <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) may be located slightly forward, as not shown in figure. Such an arrangement of two points on the right and the left of a recess enables to lengthen a depth distance without altering a depth position of a central point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Three points may be drawn by printing or such, or may be formed in such a shape as is hollowed or swelling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As long as a collimator structure of the present invention comprises such a three points and such a recess, the collimator structure may comprise more than three points, a shape except such a shape as is a point or a recess, and a structure with such. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> When a golf player swings a golf head downward, he or she always swings a golf head downward with the intention to strike the center of gravity of a head with the center of a golf ball However, it arises that the position of the center of gravity of a head does not strike upon the center of a golf ball and becomes eccentric slightly in a certain direction, either right or left This results from a physical habit that each of a golf player has. Therefore, the direction of slippage made by each of a golf player is definite. Because this slippage is minute, a general golf player is unconscious of this slippage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> If this slippage is corrected, a golf collimator structure of the present invention work more effectively. The correction of this slippage becomes possible by providing a club head with the following structure. </paragraph>

This structure <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> has such a hole <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> as is formed by boring the central portion of a head from the bottom cylindrically, and comprises the hole <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, a cylinder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, a spring ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>, a screw groove <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and a screw cap <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, wherein, as is shown with a two-dotted chain line in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), the cylinder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, made of a lightweight aluminum alloy and the like, is settled in the hole <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> by embedding the cylinder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> into the hole <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and inlaying he spring ring <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> into he screw groove <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the hole <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is covered with the screw cap <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A weight <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> comprising a heavy metal such as tungsten is buried in a cylinder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> at the eccentric state from the central line of a cylinder <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>(<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>).
