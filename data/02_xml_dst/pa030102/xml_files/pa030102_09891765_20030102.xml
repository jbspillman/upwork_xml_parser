<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a curved blade mounted to bottom from both curved sides joining the blade rotation mechanism components assembling allows the height adjustment according to the desired rotational movement, and is assembled to the parts for transmitting motion fixed onto the snow blower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A search of prior art records has unveiled the following Canadian patents: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 1. No 2,224,443 issued in 1998 to Pronovost; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. No 2,056,837 issued in 1998 to Pronovost; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> 3. No 2,256,908 issued in 2001 to Wessman; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> 4. No 1,161,462 issued in 1984 to Kelly; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> 5. No 994098 issued in 1976 to Vincent; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> 6. No 2,240,436 issued in 2000 to Pronovost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The patent issued in 2000 to Pronovost is probably the most relevant. As can be seen, a problem encountered with use of the retractable pivoting scraper blade for snow blower to Pronovost is that, it must to install of each side from the snow blower the ground shoe for that the snow blower slides in order to avoid the damaging of the blade, snow blower and the gravel inputs during the snow blowing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> To overcome the above-mentioned problem, in accordance with the teachings of the invention, there is disclosed a curved blade mounted to bottom from both curved sides joining the blade rotation mechanism components assembling allows the height adjustment according to the desired rotational movement, and is assembled to the parts for transmitting motion fixed onto the snow blower, which is relatively simple and economical to manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A sliding protective plate replacing the ground shoe is mounted under the curved blade provided with an interchangeable cutting edge protecting the curved blade and the gravel inputs or all other materials during the snow blowing. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The gist of the invention is therefore to provide a curved blade with the blade rotation mechanism components assembling allowing the height adjustment according to the desired rotational movement, and assembled onto a snow blower for allow the snow blowing and scraping in moving forward when the curved blade is in horizontal position, and to blow the snow to go backwards when the curved blade is in vertical position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A sliding protective plate replacing the ground shoe is mounted under the curved blade provided with an interchangeable cutting edge protecting the curved blade and the gravel inputs or all other materials during the snow blowing.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Now referring to the drawings, and in particular to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, a curved blade mounted to bottom from curved both sides embodying the elements of the present invention and generally designated by numeral (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) will be described. More particularly, the curved blade (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) mounted to bottom from curved both sides is intended to be used in connection with a snow blower (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) adapted to a wheel tractor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the curved blade (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) mounted to bottom from curved both sides, and the blade rotation mechanism components assembling is assembled to the parts for transmitting motion fixed onto the snow blower (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) by the blade rotation mechanism (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) and levers (<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) which activate the arms cylinder (<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) joined to the curved blade (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) mounted to bottom from curved both sides. The blade rotation mechanism components assembling is activated by two hydraulic cylinders (<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>) fixed to the snow blower (<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) by the end stop (<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>). A sliding protective plate (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) replacing the ground shoe is mounted under the curved blade (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) provided with an interchangeable cutting edge (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) protecting the curved blade (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) and the gravel inputs or all other materials during the snow blowing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring mainly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the curved blade (<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) mounted to bottom from curved both sides is made of suitable material which exibits excellent hardness, resistance and toughness properties, comprising three principal components, wherein a short cylindrical part (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) including an internal squared shape passes through a short cylidrical part (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>) provided with cup grease (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) for the lubricating of this one. The elongated squared pressure part (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) passes through the blade rotation mechanism (<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>) making turn the short cylindrical part (<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>) inwardly from the short cylindrical part (<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
