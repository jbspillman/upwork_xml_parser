<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an apparatus and method for controlling the temperature of an object, for example, heating an object. More particularly, this invention relates to the apparatus and method for improved performance of heating by combining the inductive and resistive heating produced by a heater. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> typical resistive heater circuit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with the prior art is shown. A power supply <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may provide a DC or AC voltage, typically line frequency to a heater coil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which is wrapped around in close proximity to a heated article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Typically, the heater coil <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is made up of an electrically resistive element with an insulation layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> applied to prevent it from shorting out. It is also common to have the entire heater coil encased in a cover <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to form a modular heating subassembly. The prior art is replete with examples of ways to apply heat to material and raise the temperature of the heated article <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to a predetermined level. Most of these examples center around the use of resistive or ohmic heat generators that are in mechanical and thermal communication with the article to be heated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Resistive heaters are the predominate method used today. Resistive heat is generated by the ohmic or resistive losses that occur when current flows through a wire. The heat generated in the coil of the resistive type heater must then be transmitted to the workpice by conduction or radiation. The use and construction of resistive heaters is well known and in most cases is easier and cheaper to use than inductive heaters. Most resistive heaters are made from helically wound coils, wrapped onto a form, or formed into sinuous loop elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A typical invention using a resistive type heater can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,973,296 to Juliano et al. which teaches a thick film heater apparatus that generates heat through ohmic losses in a resistive trace that is printed on the surface of a cylindrical substrate. The heat generated by the ohmic losses is transferred to molten plastic in a nozzle to maintain the plastic in a free flowing state. While resistive type heaters are relatively inexpensive, they have some considerable drawbacks. Close tolerance fits, hot spots, oxidation of the coil and slower heat up times are just a few. For this method of heating, the maximum heating power can not exceed P<highlight><subscript>R(max)</subscript></highlight>&equals;(I<highlight><subscript>R(max)</subscript></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight><highlight><subscript>x</subscript></highlight>R<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>, where I<highlight><subscript>R(max) </subscript></highlight>is equal to the maximum current the resistive wire can carry and R<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>is the resistance of the coil. In addition, minimum time to heat up a particular article is governed by t<highlight><subscript>R(min)</subscript></highlight>&equals;(cM&Dgr;T)/P<highlight><subscript>R(max)</subscript></highlight>, where c is the specific heat of the article, M is the mass of the article and &Dgr;T is the change in temperature desired. For resistive heating, total energy losses at the heater coil is essentially equal to zero because all of the energy from the power supply that enters the coil is converted to heat energy, therefore P<highlight><subscript>R(losses)</subscript></highlight>&equals;0. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> typical induction heating circuit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> according to the prior art is shown. A variable frequency AC power supply <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is connected in parallel to a tuning capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Tuning capacitor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> makes up for the reactive losses in the load and minimizes any such losses. Induction heater coil <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is typically comprised of a hollow copper tube, having an electrically insulating coating <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> applied to its outer surface and a cooling fluid <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> running inside the tube. The cooling fluid <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is communicated to a cooling system <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to remove heat away from the induction heater coil <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The heater coil <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is not generally in contact with the article to be heated <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As the current flows through the coil <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, lines of magnetic flux are created as depicted by arrows <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Induction heating is a method of heating electrically conducting materials with alternating current (AC) electric power. Alternating current electric power is applied to an electrical conducting coil, like copper, to create an alternating magnetic field. This alternating magnetic field induces alternating electric voltages and current in a workpiece that is closely coupled to the coil. These alternating currents generate electrical resistance losses and thereby heat the workpiece. Therefore, an important characteristic of induction heating is the ability to deliver heat into electrical conductive materials without direct contact between the heating element and the workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> If an alternating current flows through a coil, a magnetic field is produced that varies with the amount of current. If an electrically conductive load is placed inside the coil, eddy currents will be induced inside the load. The eddy currents will flow in a direction opposite to the current flow in the coil. These induced currents in the load produce a magnetic field in the direction opposite to the field produced by the coil and prevent the field from penetrating to the center of the load. The eddy currents are therefore concentrated at the surface of the load an decrease dramatically towards the center. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, the induction heater coil <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is wrapped around a cylindrical heated body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The current density J<highlight><subscript>x </subscript></highlight>is shown by line <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the graph. As a result of this phenomenon, almost all the current is generated in the area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the cylindrical heated body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the material <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> contained central to the heated body is not utilized for the generation of heat. This phenomenon is often referred to as &ldquo;skin effect&rdquo;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Within this art, the depth where current density in the load drops to a value of 37% of its maximum is called the penetration depth (&dgr;). As a simplifying assumption, all of the current in the load can be safely assumed to be within the penetration depth. This simplifying assumption is useful in calculating the resistance of the current path in the load. Since the load has inherent resistance to current flow, heat will be generated in the load. The amount of heat generated (Q) is a function of the product of resistance (R) and the eddy current (I) squared and time (t), Q&equals;I<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>Rt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The depth of penetration is one of the most important factors in the design of an induction heating system. The general formula for depth of penetration &dgr; is given by:

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> where &mgr;<highlight><subscript>&ugr;</subscript></highlight>&equals;magnetic permeability of a vacuum </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> &mgr;&equals;relative magnetic permeability of the load </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> &rgr;&equals;resistivity of the load </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> &fnof;&equals;frequency of alternating current </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Thus, the depth of penetration is a function of three variables, two of which are related to the load. The variables are the electrical resistivity of the load, the magnetic permeability of the load, and the frequency &eegr; of the alternating current in the coil. The magnetic permeability of a vacuum is a constant equal to 4&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;7 </superscript></highlight>(Wb/A m). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A major reason for calculating the depth of penetration is to determine how much current will flow within the load of a given size. Since the heat generated is related to the square of the eddy current (I<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>), it is imperative to have as large a current flow in the load as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, induction heating coils are almost exclusively made of hollow copper tubes with water cooling running therein. Induction coils, like resistive heaters, exhibit some level of resistive heat generation. This phenomenon is undesirable because as heat builds in the coil it effects all of the physical properties of the coil and directly impacts heater efficiency. Additionally, as heat rises in the coil, oxidation of the coil material increases and this severely limits the life of the coil. This is why the prior art has employed means to draw heat away from the induction coil by use of a fluid transfer medium. This unused heat, according to the prior art, is wasted heat energy which lowers the overall efficiency of the induction heater. In addition, adding active cooling means like flowing water to the system greatly increases the system&apos;s cost and reduces reliability. It is therefore advantageous to find a way to utilize the resistive heat generated in an induction coil which will reduce overall heater complexity and increases the system efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to the prior art, various coatings are used to protect the coils from the high temperature of the heated workpiece and to provide electrical insulation. These coatings include cements, fiberglass, and ceramics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Induction heating power supplies are classified by the frequency of the current supplied to the coil. These systems can be classified as line-frequency systems, motor-alternating systems, solid-state systems and radio-frequency systems. Line-frequency systems operate at 50 or 60 Hz which is available from the power grid. These are the lowest cost systems and are typically used for the heating of large billets because of the large depth of penetration. The lack of frequency conversion is the major economic advantage to these systems. It is therefore advantageous to design an induction heating system that will use line frequencies efficiently, thereby reducing the overall cost of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,799,720 to Ross et al. shows an inductively heated nozzle assembly for the transferring of molten metal. This nozzle is a box-like structure with insulation between the walls of the box and the inductive coil. The molten metal flowing within the box structure is heated indirectly via the inductive coil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,726,751 to Shibata et al. discloses a hot-runner plastic injection system with tubular nozzles with induction heating windings wrapped around the outside of the nozzle. The windings are attached to a high frequency power source in series with one another. The tubular nozzle itself is heated by the inductive coil which in turn transfers heat to the molten plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,979,506 to Aarseth discloses a method and system for heating oil pipelines that employs the use of heater cables displaced along the periphery of the pipeline. The heater cables exhibit both resistive and inductive heat generation which is transmitted to the wall of the pipeline and thereby to the contents in the pipeline. This axial application of the electrical conductors is being utilized primarily for ohmic heating as a resistor relying on the inherent resistance of the long conductors (&gt;10 km). Aarseth claims that some inductive heating can be achieved with varying frequency of the power supply from 0-500 Hz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,061,835 to Iguchi discloses an apparatus comprised of a low frequency electromagnetic heater utilizing low voltage electrical transformer with short circuit secondary. Arrangement of the primary coil, magnetic iron core and particular design of the secondary containment with prescribed resistance is the essence of this disclosure. The disclosure describes a low temperature heater where conventional resinous molding compound is placed around primary coil and fills the space between iron core and secondary pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,874,916 to Burke discloses a structure for induction coil with a multi-layer winding arranged with transformer means and magnetic core to equalize the current flow in each winding throughout the operational window. Specially constructed coil is made from individual strands and arranged in such a way that each strand occupies all possible radial positions to the same extent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> There exists a need however for an improved heating method that utilizes both the inductive and resistive heat generated from a heating coil and a method to reduce or eliminate leakage flux and locate the coil inside the heating apparatus to produce optimal use of the heat generated therein. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention to provide a method of heating that deliver almost 100% of energy from power supply to the heated article and thereby obviating the need for a tuning capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method of heating where the same current through the coil provides a higher rate of heating because both resistive and inductive heating is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a heating method where induction coil cooling is not required. </paragraph>

This may be accomplished by use of the variable frequency power supply, where frequency of the supplied current can be lowered to reduce inductive coupling within same heated object. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> To this end, the present invention provides a heating method and apparatus which utilizes a specifically adapted induction heater coil embedded within an electrically conductive and/or a ferromagnetic substrate. The placement in the substrate is based on an analytical analysis of the heater design and results in an optimal location that provides a maximum of usable heat generation. The heater coil within the substrate will generate both resistive and inductive heat that will be directed towards the article or medium to be heated. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> simplified schematic of an exemplicative embodiment <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the present invention is generally shown. A power supply <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> provides an alternating current to a heater coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that is wrapped around and in communication with bodies <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, and not by limitation, the coil <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is placed within a groove <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> formed between bodies <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which forms a closed magnetic structure. When an alternating current is applied to the coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, magnetic lines of flux are generated as shown by arrows <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. It should be noted, that a plurality of magnetic lines of flux are generated around the entire periphery of the bodies, and the two lines shown, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, are for simplification. These magnetic lines of flux generate eddy currents in the bodies <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which generates heat in accordance with the skin-effect principles described previously. In the preferred embodiment, the body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>can be optimally designed to maximize the magnetic lines of flux <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to generate the most heat possible. In addition, the coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is in thermal communication with the bodies <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so that any resistive heat that is generated in the coil <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is conducted to the bodies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3C</cross-reference>, another exemplicative preferred embodiment 47 of the present invention is generally shown. Although cylinders are primarily shown and discussed herein, it is to be understood that the use of the term cylinder or tube in this application is by no means to be limited to circular cylinders or tubes; it is intended that these terms encompass any cross-sectional shape. Furthermore, although the electrical circuit arrangements illustrated all employ direct or ohmmic connection to a source of electric power, it is to be understood that the invention is not so limited since the range of its application also includes those cases where the electric power source is electrically coupled to the heating element inductively or capacitively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A heater coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is wrapped in a helical fashion around a core <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the heater coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is made from solid metallic material like copper or other non-magnetic, electrically and thermally conductive material. Alternatively, the coil could be made from high resistance high temperature alloy. Use of the conductors with low resistance will increase inductive power rate that may be useful in some heating applications. One wire construction that can be used for low resistance coil is litz wire. Litz wire construction is designed to minimize the power losses exhibited in solid conductors due to skin effect. Skin effect is the tendency of the high frequency current to concentrate at the surface of the conductor. Litz construction counteracts this effect by increasing the amount of surface are without significantly increasing the size of the conductor. Litz wire is comprised of thousands of fine copper wires, each strand on the order of 0.001 inch in diameter and electrical insulation applied around each strand so that each strand acts as an independent conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> An inside wall <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the core <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> defines a passageway <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> for the transfer of a fluid or solid material which is to be heated. In the preferred embodiment, and by way of example only, the fluid material could be a gas, water, molten plastic, molten metal or any other material. A yoke <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is located around and in thermal communication with the heater coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment the yoke <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is also made preferably (but not exclusively) from a ferromagnetic material. The coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be placed in a groove <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> that is provided between the core <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and yoke <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The core <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and yoke <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are preferably in thermal communication with the heater coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. To increase heat transfer between the heater coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the core or yoke, a suitable helical groove may be provided in at least the core or yoke to further seat the heater coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and increase the contact area therein. This increased contact area will increase the conduction of heat from the heater coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the core or yoke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> An alternating current source (not shown) of a suitable frequency is connected serially to the coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for communication of current therethrough. In the preferred embodiment, the frequency of the current source is selected to match the physical design of the heater. Alternatively, the frequency of the current source can be fixed, preferably around 50-60 Hz to reduce the cost of the heating system, and the physical size of the core <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and/or yoke <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the heater coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be modified to produce the most efficient heater for that given frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The application of alternating current through the heater coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will generate both inductive and resistive heating of the heater coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and create heat in the core <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and yoke <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by generation of eddy currents as described previously. The diameter and wall thickness of the core <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is selected to achieve the highest heater efficiency possible and determines the most efficient coil diameter. Based on the method to be described hereinafter, the heater coil diameter is selected based on the various physical properties and performance parameters for a given heater design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>C, an enlarged cross-section of the heater coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is shown with a graphical representation of the current density in the various components. The heater coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is traversed along its major axis or length by a high frequency alternating current from the alternating current source. The effect of this current flow is to create a current density profile as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> along the cross section of the heater coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. As one skilled in the art will clearly see, the curves <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> each represent the skin-effect within each of the components. For the coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the coil exhibits a current density in the conductor cross section as shown in trace <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that is a maximum at the outer edge of the conductor and decreases exponentially towards the center of the conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Since the present invention places the heater coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> between the ferromagnetic core <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and yoke <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the skin effect phenomenon will also occur in these components. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</cross-reference> shows the current density profile within a cross sectional area of the yoke and the core. As mentioned previously, for all practical purposes, all induced current is contained with an area along the skin of each component at a depth equal to 36. Curve <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> shows the current density that is induced in core <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. At a distance <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from the center of the coil, essentially 100% of the current is contained in the core and acts to generate heat. Curve <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> however shows the current density in the yoke <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, where a portion of the current depicted by shaded area <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is not contained in the yoke, and as such is not generating heat. This lost opportunity to generate heat energy reduces the overall heater efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> For this method of heating, various parameters of the heater design can be analyzed and altered to produce a highly efficient heater. These parameters include: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The electrical specific resistance of the coil (&rgr;<highlight><subscript>coil</subscript></highlight>) and coil physical dimensions (n, d, R<highlight><subscript>o</subscript></highlight>, l) are major contributors to the creation of resistive heat energy in the coil. Heretofore, the prior art considered this heat generation as unusable and used several methods to mitigate it. Firstly using Litz wire to reduce resistive heat generation and second to cool the coil with suitable coolant. As a result, heaters do not operate at peak efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> With this in mind, the present invention harnesses all of the energy in the induction coil and harness this energy for process heating. To effectively transfer all of the energy of the coil to the process we will select the material and place the induction coil within the substrate at the optimal location (or depth) that will be based on an analysis of the process heating requirements, mechanical structure requirements, and speed of heating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, as shown for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> material can be Nichrome, which has a resistance that is six times higher than copper. With this increased resistance, we can generate six times more heat than using copper coil as suggested in prior art. In pure induction heating systems, commonly used high frequency induction heating equipment would not be able to operate under increased heater resistance. Power supplies known today operate on minimum coil resistance which supports the resonant state of the heating apparatus. Typically, according to the prior art, an increase in coil resistance will significantly decrease the efficiency of the heating system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> must be electrically insulated from the core and yoke to operate. So, a material providing a high dielectric insulating coating <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> around the coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> must be provided. Coil insulation <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> must also be a good thermal conductor to enable heat transfer from the coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to the yoke and core. Materials with good dielectric properties and excellent thermal conductivity are readily available. Finally, coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> must be placed in the intimate contact with the heated core and yoke. Dielectrics with good thermal conductivity are commercially available in solid forms as well as in forms of powders and as potting compounds. Which form of dielectric to use is up to the individual application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Total useful energy generated by the coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> installed within the yoke and core is given by the following relationship: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> P<highlight><subscript>combo</subscript></highlight>Q<highlight><subscript>(resistive)</subscript></highlight>&plus;Q<highlight><subscript>(inductive) </subscript></highlight></paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Where: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Q&equals;heat energy </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> P<highlight><subscript>combo&equals;</subscript></highlight>Rate of energy generated by combination of inductive and resistive heating </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> I<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&equals;total current in the heating coil </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> R<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>&equals;Induction coil resistance </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> I<highlight><subscript>ec</subscript></highlight>&equals;total equivalent eddy current in the heated article </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> R<highlight><subscript>ec</subscript></highlight>&equals;equivalent eddy current resistance in heated Article </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> The second part of the above equation is the inductive contribution as a result of the current flowing through the coil and inducing eddy currents in the core and yoke. Since the coil <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is placed between the core <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and the yoke <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, we have no coupling losses and therefore maximum energy transfer is achieved. From the energy equation it can be seen that the same coil current provides more heating power in comparison with pure resistive or pure inductive method. Consequently, for the same power level, the temperature of the heater coil can be significantly lower than compared to pure resistive heating. In contemporary induction heating all of the energy generated as ohmic losses in the induction coil is removed by cooling, as discussed previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In cases of structural part heating, reduction of thermal gradients-in the part is important. Resistive and inductive heating generates thermal gradients and combination of both heating means reduce thermal gradients significantly for the same power rate. While resistive heating elements may reach a temperature of 1600&deg; F., the heated article may not begin to conduct heat away into sub-surface layers for some time. This thermal lag results in large temperature gradients at the material surface. Significant tensile stress exists in the skin of the heated article due to dynamic thermal gradients. Similarly, induction heating only creates heat in a thin skin layer of the heated article at a high rate. These deleterious effects can be significantly diminished by combining together the two separate heating sources in accordance with the present invention which in turn results in evening out temperature gradients and therefore reducing local stress level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 4</cross-reference>A, another exemplicative preferred embodiment 100 of the present invention is generally shown. It should be noted, the current figures show a typical arrangement for injection molding metals such as magnesium, but numerous other arrangements for injection molding materials such as plastic could easily be envisioned with very little effort by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> The heated nozzle <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is comprised of an elongated outer piece <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> having a passageway <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> formed therein for the communication of a fluid. The fluid could be molten metal such as for example magnesium, plastic or other like fluids. In a preferred embodiment, the fluid is a magnesium alloy in a thixotropic state. In a preferred embodiment, threads <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are provided at a proximal end of the outer piece <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which interfaces with threads formed on a nozzle head <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Nozzle head <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is rigidly affixed to the outer piece <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and an inner piece <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is inserted between the head <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the outer piece <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The passageway <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> continues through inner piece <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> for communication of the fluid to an outlet <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. An annular gap <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is provided between inner piece <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and outer piece <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for insertion of a heater coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In this preferred embodiment, a taper <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is provided between the nozzle head <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and the inner piece <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to insure good mechanical connection. Electrical conductors <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are inserted through grooves <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> respectively for connection to the heater coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The heater coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is preferably provided with an electrically insulative coating as described previously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As shown by the figures, with this arrangement, the heater coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> has been sandwiched between a ferromagnetic inner piece <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and a ferromagnetic outer piece <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which forms a closed magnetic circuit around the coil. Preferably, the heater coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is in physical contact with both the inner piece <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the outer piece <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> for increased heat conduction from the coil. But a slight gap between the heater coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the inner and outer piece would still function properly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, alternating current is communicated through the heater coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> thereby generating inductive heat in the outer piece <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the inner piece <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and the nozzle head <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> as well. Current flowing through coil <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> will also create resistive heat in the coil itself which will be conducted to the inner and outer pieces. In this arrangement, little or no heat energy is lost or wasted, but is directed at the article to be heated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, which shows a table comparing the various design criteria for each method of heating previously discussed. From this table, the reader can quickly appreciate the advantages associated with using the method of heating in accordance with the present invention. According to the present invention, more heat energy is generated with less energy loss without the use of auxiliary cooling and without the use of a resonance filter. As a result, the time to heat up a given article is less and is achieved in a more controlled manner depending on the heater coil design. </paragraph>
