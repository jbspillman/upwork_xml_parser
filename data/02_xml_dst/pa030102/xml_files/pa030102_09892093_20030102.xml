<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is related generally to microwave systems, and, more particularly, to transparent high-power windows used in the millimeter region. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Microwave systems often require windows that are transparent at the frequencies of interest. This problem is particularly acute at millimeter-wave frequencies, where most dielectric materials tend to have high loss tangents. At low power levels, a high loss tangent may be acceptable, as long as the window is thin enough to prevent more than a small fraction of the incident power from being absorbed. At high power levels, a window made from a material having a high loss tangent will become extremely hot and may fail if not actively cooled. Such windows are usually cooled at their edges, since most coolants themselves have high loss tangents and therefore cannot be directly exposed to millimeter-wave power. The need therefore exists for a microwave window capable of reliably transmitting extremely high levels of millimeter-wave power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Surface-cooled double-disk windows made from sapphire have been used as the output windows for high-power gyrotrons. These windows are cooled by a special coolant having a low loss tangent at millimeter-wave frequencies. The coolant flows in the gap between the two disks. While double-disk windows improve upon the performance of single-disk edge-cooled windows, their thermal performance is insufficient to allow megawatt-class gyrotrons designed for CW operation to operate for more than a few seconds at a time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, synthetic diamond disks of sufficient size and quality for use as gyrotron output windows have become available. Diamond is a nearly ideal material for use as a dielectric window, as the loss tangent of high-quality material is very low at millimeter-wave frequencies (&lt;5&times;10<highlight><superscript>&minus;5</superscript></highlight>) and its thermal conductivity is twice that of copper. However, because a disk of sufficient size and thickness for a gyrotron window takes several weeks to grow, and because there are few sources for such disks, diamond windows are very expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Thus, there remains a need for transparent windows at millimeter frequencies that avoid most, if not all, of the problems described above. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, a millimeter-wave window is constructed from a high conductivity metal such as copper, beryllium copper, or aluminum. The metallic plate is made transparent over a range of frequencies by perforating it with a periodic array of slots, or openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the millimeter-wave window of the present invention is used as the output window in a gyrotron. In such a case, one suitable periodic array of slots, or holes, comprises an equilateral triangular array of slots. By proper choice of the hole spacing and diameter, the window can be made transparent at any desired frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In addition to being transparent, however, the output window must also be vacuum tight, as the pressure inside a gyrotron must be maintained at a level on the order of 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;9 </superscript></highlight>torr. The present invention solves this problem by covering the surface of the high-pressure side of the window with a thin layer of a suitable dielectric material. A suitable dielectric will have a low loss tangent and a low coefficient of thermal expansion. In addition, if the dielectric is to be used in a high-vacuum environment, it must be of a material that does not continuously evolve gasses from its surface (ruling out the use of most polymers and organic-based materials). Materials suitable for use in a high-vacuum environment include alumina, fused quartz, sapphire, and CVD diamond. For applications in which the window must provide an air-tight seal but is not required to maintain a high vacuum, the last requirement on the window material can be relaxed. Because the dielectric is in intimate contact with the perforated metal plate, any heat generated in the dielectric layer has only to diffuse to the dielectric-metal boundary, where it is quickly carried away by conduction in the much higher conductivity metal. As a result, the dielectric need not have a high thermal conductivity. For most applications, edge cooling of the metal-dielectric window should provide sufficient cooling. For very high-power applications where edge cooling may be inadequate, cooling channels may be incorporated directly into the interior of the perforated metal plate, which will allow the window to transmit more power than its edge-cooled counterpart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The novel features of the present invention are its use of a periodic metal structure as a high-power microwave window. Metal structures have been used in windows before, but usually in such a way so as not to interfere with the transmission of microwave energy; this is typically done by placing thin metal ribs perpendicular to the incident electric field. The present invention takes a different approach by making a metal structure an integral part of the window, one that strongly interacts with the incident microwave fields. This approach toward window design is considered to be novel and unique.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, a transparent metallic millimeter-wave window is provided. The window is constructed from a high conductivity metal, such as copper. One can make a metallic plate transparent over a range of frequencies by perforating it with a periodic array of slots. For the output window of a gyrotron, one might choose an equilateral triangular array of circular holes. By proper choice of the hole spacing and diameter, the window can be made transparent at any desired frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In particular, the present invention is a dielectric-covered metallic window that is transparent at millimeter-wave frequencies. The window is constructed from a metal plate perforated by a periodic array of holes and covered by a thin dielectric plate. The diameter of the holes and the periodicity of the array are chosen to minimize the power reflected at the design frequency. A window constructed to demonstrate the concept is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a metal plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, provided with a plurality of holes, or slots, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be circular or other, non-circular shape, depending on the particular design needs. The metal plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises a high conductivity metal, such as copper, beryllium-copper alloy, or aluminum. The array can be triangular, preferably isosceles triangle or equilateral triangle, or other periodic array. Further, the array can be totally periodic across the metal plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or of varying periodicity, depending on the particular design needs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The individual components are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Specifically, a retainer ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> holds a dielectric plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> against the perforated metal plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The retainer ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is secured to a like retainer ring <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&prime; on the periphery of the perforated metal plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by a plurality of spaced fasteners, such as screws <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The dielectric plate comprises a dielectric material such as fused quartz, alumina, sapphire, or chemically-vapor-deposited (CVD) diamond. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Such a window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is expected to prove particularly useful at millimeter-wave frequencies, where most dielectric materials are poorly suited for use as windows due to their high loss tangents and poor thermal conductivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As an example, high-power millimeter-wave gyrotrons have been built with output powers of up to 1 MW at frequencies up to 140 GHz. At megawatt power levels, the pulse length has been limited only by the lack of a material for the output window capable of transmitting the power without overheating. Gyrotron output windows have traditionally been constructed from sapphire, and more recently from CVD diamond. CVD diamond is an excellent material from which to construct gyrotron output windows, as it has a low loss tangent, excellent mechanical properties, and a thermal conductivity more than twice that of copper. Unfortunately, it is difficult to grow and is available only from a few sources, which makes it very expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a high-performance low-cost alternative to diamond for gyrotron output window and for other applications. While the thermal conductivity of the dielectric plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is far less than that of diamond, any heat generated in the dielectric has only to flow into the perforated metallic plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, from which it is rapidly conducted to the cooling channels (not shown) at the edge of the plate. While the perforated metallic plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a thermal conductivity which is less than half that of diamond, the overall thermal conductance of the window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is determined not only by the thermal conductivity of the material from which it is constructed, but also by its thickness. In general, for a given window material and thickness, the thermal conductance is proportional to the product of the thermal conductivity of the window material and its thickness, so that increasing the window thickness by a factor of two will increase its thermal conductance by the same factor. In order to minimize reflections, the thickness of a purely dielectric window is typically chosen to be an odd multiple of &lgr;/2 (where &lgr; is the wavelength inside the material). At 95 GHz, a &lgr;/2 diamond window will be 26 mils thick, and a 3&lgr;/2 diamond window will be 81 mils thick (and will cost significantly more than a &lgr;/2 diamond window). The present invention does not suffer from this constraint on the thickness. Any convenient value can be chosen for the thickness of the window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; once the thickness of the underlying metallic plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the dielectric cover <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> have been chosen, the hole pattern and diameter can be chosen to make the window transparent at the desired operating frequency. For the prototype window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the perforated metallic plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is 250 mils thick, almost 10 times that of a &lgr;/2 diamond window. Assuming that the thermal conductivity of diamond is twice that of the metallic plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the prototype metallic window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will have a thermal conductance approximately 5 times that of a &lgr;/2 diamond window. In summary, then, the thermal performance of the transparent metallic window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention can be equivalent or superior to that of a diamond window at a fraction of the cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the dielectric plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is held in place against the perforated metal plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by the retainer ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. For many applications, the seal that a window of this type provides is adequate. However, for applications in which one side of the window must be maintained at a very low pressure (e.g., the interior of a gyrotron where the pressure must be maintained at approximately 10<highlight><superscript>&minus;9 </superscript></highlight>torr), a different method of construction is required. Since many ceramics (alumina, diamond, and sapphire, for example) can be metallized for brazing to copper, dielectric plates <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> made from these materials can be brazed directly to a copper window structure, providing a much better vacuum seal than is possible using a retainer ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Such a seal can be ensured by adapting conventional techniques that have been developed for constructing ceramic-to-metal seals for use with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> One possible realization of a ceramic-to-metal vacuum seal in which the conventional techniques of vacuum window construction have been applied to the present invention is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a; </italic></highlight>see, e.g., J. F. Gittens, <highlight><italic>Power Travelling</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>Wave Tubes</italic></highlight>, pp. 236-237, American Elsevier Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1965). In keeping with conventional practice in the microwave tube industry, the metallic plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably copper. The plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> incorporates a thin-walled copper tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to which the ceramic plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is brazed. A double &ldquo;corset&rdquo; <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> consisting of an inner ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of molybdenum and an outer ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of mild steel ensures that the ceramic-to-metal seal is held in slight compression at all temperatures. Only the molybdenum ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is in place during the first heating to braze; it is designed to achieve a close fit around the thin-walled copper tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at room temperature. Due to its lower thermal expansion coefficient, the molybdenum ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will expand more slowly than the thin-walled copper tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, thus maintaining intimate contact between the copper tube and the ceramic plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> during and after the brazing process. The outer mild steel ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is made to be a close fit at the brazing temperature, so that its inside diameter is slightly smaller than the outer diameter of the molybdenum ring <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at room temperature; it is dropped into place at the brazing temperature. As it cools, the outer steel ring <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> contracts, placing the ceramic-to-metal seal into a controlled amount of compression; this ensures that the brazed joints are subjected to neither tension nor sheer at any time, making it possible for them to survive repeated temperature cycling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> An even simpler procedure can be used to construct a high-quality vacuum seal if the dielectric plate material <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is fused quartz; FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>show one possible realization of such a seal. The window assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> consists of the perforated copper plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provided with a raised rim <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that supports a molybdenum ring <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The molybdenum ring includes a raised inner rim <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that extends towards the surface of the perforated copper plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and terminates in a knife edge <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is embedded in a raised rim <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, forming what is known as a Housekeeper&apos;s seal <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the raised lip, or rim, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> define a quartz &ldquo;cup&rdquo;. No specific mechanism is included in this design to guarantee intimate contact between the quartz cup and the perforated copper plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; such contact will be ensured by the force exerted by atmospheric pressure on the quartz cup. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In its best mode for high-vacuum applications, then, a vacuum seal is provided between the dielectric plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the metal plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present teachings are not limited to the manner in which the vacuum seals are constructed in FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The predicted performance of the window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> was calculated by approximating the finite array of holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with an infinite array illuminated by a plane wave. The periodicity of the structure and the plane-wave excitation allow approximation of the reflected and transmitted fields by an expansion in terms of a finite number of discrete plane waves (Floquet modes), while the fields in the circular holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are expanded in terms of a finite number of circular waveguide modes. By imposing continuity on the tangential electric and magnetic fields at the two surfaces of the array, a matrix equation is obtained for the unknown waveguide mode coefficients. The amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted Floquet modes are then derived from the solution to this matrix equation. The computational method employed herein is based, e.g., on C. C. Chen, &ldquo;Transmission through a conducting screen perforated periodically with apertures&rdquo;, <highlight><italic>IEEE Microwave Theory Tech</italic></highlight>., Vol. MTT-18, no. 9, pp. 627-632, (September 1970). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The operating frequency of the window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is determined by the diameter of the holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the periodicity of the array <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, and the thickness of the plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The operating frequency of the window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> is 95 GHz. To avoid scattering energy into directions other than normal to the window surfaces, the periodicity of the array <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> must be such that grating lobes cannot exist. If the holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are arranged in an isosceles triangular array <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>&prime; such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, then it can be shown that no grating lobes can exist if the following conditions are satisfied:

Within these constraints, one must choose the hole diameter <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>the plate thickness D, and, for a given dielectric material, the dielectric thickness L to provide transparency at the desired operating frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The predicted performance of the window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 7</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows the power transmission coefficient as a function of frequency for both vertically and horizontally polarized incident waves. Since any incident wave can be decomposed into vertically and horizontally-polarized components, this Figure indicates that the window will transmit nearly 100% of the incident power at the design frequency of 95 GHz independent of the polarization of the incident field. Losses in the conductor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the dielectric <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will, of course, result in a finite loss; these results indicate that such losses should be quite low. In addition, the calculations predict that the window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will have a reasonable bandwidth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Periodic structures often have the undesired effect of producing cross-polarized reflected and transmitted field components, i.e., electric field components orthogonal to that of the incident field. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows that not to be the case with the window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows the cross-polarized power reflection and transmission coefficients as functions of frequency. As both the reflection and transmission coefficients are less than &minus;68 dB across the entire band of interest, almost none of the incident wave is converted into cross-polarized reflected or transmitted components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The sensitivity of the window performance to the various dimensions was examined in detail. The tolerances given above for the dimensions of the perforated metallic plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> were derived based on these calculations. Moreover, past experience with structures of this type (without dielectric covers) indicates that the metallic plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> should yield the desired performance if it conforms to the given tolerances. The window&apos;s performance is most sensitive to the thickness of the dielectric plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In this example, the dielectric plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is made from Coming 7940 fused silica, whose dielectric constant is 3.827 at 95 GHz. Note that this material is not suitable for use in a high-vacuum environment, as fused silica is porous and cannot provide a vacuum seal. This material was used in constructing the prototype window because it is inexpensive and because its dielectric constant and loss tangent at 95 GHz are known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the power reflection coefficient increases from nearly &minus;55 dB when L&equals;36 mils to less than &minus;30 dB when L&equals;35.75 mils or L&equals;36.25 mils, which is still acceptable for most applications (including use as an output window for a high-power gyrotron). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The performance of the transparent millimeter-wave window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> was tested by illuminating it with a Gaussian millimeter-wave beam generated by a lens antenna. The window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> was placed at the waist of the Gaussian beam, and a second lens antenna was used to receive the transmitted beam. Measured values of the power transmission coefficient are plotted as a function of frequency in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The power transmission coefficient is essentially flat over the range of frequencies shown, and is less than 0.1 dB at the design frequency of 95 GHz, so that more than 98% of the incident power is transmitted by the window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In instances involving high energy density beams, such as beams of 100 KW to 1 MW and diameter of 2 to 3 inches, as commonly found in gyrotrons, it may be desirable to cool the window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Cooling may be accomplished by cooling around the edges with a cooling jacket <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, or by integrating cooling channels <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> into the interior of the metallic window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. The former Figure is based on the vacuum embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, while the latter Figure is based on the vacuum embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. However, the method of cooling is not limited to the particular vacuum embodiment nor to any vacuum embodiment at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In summary, the present invention is directed to a transparent millimeter-wave metallic window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The window <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> consists of a metallic plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> perforated by a periodic array <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of coupling holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and covered by a thin dielectric plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The diameter of the holes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the dimensions of the array, and the thickness of the metallic plate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and dielectric plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are chosen to yield maximum transmission and minimum reflection at the design frequency.
