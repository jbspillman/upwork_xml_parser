<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to systems and methods for controlling an electric motor and, more particularly, to a controller and associated system and method for switching noise reduction of a pulse-width-modulated controlled brushless direct current (BLDC) motor. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Electrical machines are used throughout a great number of devices today, and typically consist of motors, which convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, and generators, which convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Generally, electrical machines fall into one of three categories: polyphase synchronous machines, polyphase asynchronous (i.e., induction) machines and direct current (DC) machines. Typical machines consist of two main portions: a stationary, outside portion called a stator, and a rotating, inner portion called a rotor. The rotor of typical machines is mounted on a stiff rod, or shaft, that is supported in bearings so that the rotor is free to turn within the stator to produce mechanical energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In one type of synchronous machine, a permanent magnet, brushless direct current (BLDC) machine, the stator is composed of windings that are connected to a controller, and the rotor is composed of two or more permanent magnets of opposed magnetic polarity. The controller generates poly-phase alternating input currents to the stator windings. As the rotor rotates within the stator, and the magnets of one polarity approach cores that conduct the opposed polarity, sensors signal the angular position of the rotor to the controller which, in turn, controls the alternating currents to switch the polarity of the magnetic field produced by windings on the stator. For example, a three-phase BLDC motor can have two, four or more permanent magnets with alternating magnetic polarities mounted on its rotor. The required rotating magnetic field is produced by current through the stator windings. And the three phases of the current are switched in sequence, which is dictated by the angular position of the rotor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In many BLDC motor systems, the speed of the BLDC motor is controlled by pulse modulating, such as pulse width modulating, the input voltage generated by the controller. By pulse-width-modulation (PWM) of the input voltage, the controller controls the average input currents to the windings by using &ldquo;on&rdquo; and &ldquo;off&rdquo; states. During the time the input currents through the windings are increasing, the voltage supply provides constant voltage to the controller at a level at least the as high as the motor voltage required for the desired speed of operation. Once the currents have reached the required levels for the desired speed of the motor, the duty cycle is changed to that required to maintain the currents at or near the required level of current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> While PWM can provide an acceptable method of controlling the speed of a BLDC motor, it has some drawbacks. Among the drawbacks, in addition to producing currents at the desired rotational frequency, modulating the voltages produces in the system an unwanted current ripple at the PWM switching frequency and at higher harmonics of that frequency. The ripple current is a superimposed current on the average input currents to the windings, generated as the system keeps the input currents centered about an average value. The ripple current disadvantageously manifests itself as electromagnetic interference (EMI) and causes vibration noise in the system in the form of mechanical motion (i.e., rotational and megneto-striction) within the motor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The amount of ripple current, I<highlight><subscript>ripple</subscript></highlight>, produced in the system generally depends upon the switching, fundamental frequency, &ohgr;, the voltage across the motor inductance, V<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>, and the amount of motor inductance, L, as shown in equation (1):

<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> As illustrated by equation (1), the ripple current can be reduced by increasing the fundamental frequency or the motor inductance. But these options are costly and have a large schedule impact to the system beyond the motor itself. Also, these options cannot generally be implemented in many current motor controllers as these current motor controllers are not typically manufactured in high drive frequency configurations. Another possible option to reducing the ripple current is to filter the EMI and, therefore, the noise out of the system at the frequencies where the controller produces the ripple current, which effectively increases the motor inductance. But because many motor systems are subjected to large currents and voltages, implementing filters in the system would require costly, robust filters with high current and voltage tolerances. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In light of the foregoing, the present invention provides an improved controller and associated system and method for controlling a brushless direct current (BLDC) motor. The system of the present invention operates with a pulse-width-modulation (PWM) controller to reduce ripple current by controlling the voltage provided to the controller from a voltage source. By controlling the voltage provided by the voltage source, the controller can limit the amount of voltage produced at the motor inductance, which limits the ripple current, which limits the EMI and, thus, the noise produced in the system. Advantageously, the system reduces the ripple current without adding large and costly filters, forcing expensive changes to the controller design, or impacting the schedule for delivery of these systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment, the system for controlling the BLDC motor includes a power supply having a controllably alterable voltage output, and a controller in electrical communication with the power supply and the motor. The controller receives the voltage output of the power supply and can provide a pulse-width-modulated input voltage to the motor. Additionally, the controller can measure an average input current to the motor and a speed of the motor and, thereafter, alter the voltage output of the power supply based upon the average input current to the motor and the speed of the motor. In a further embodiment, the system can include an acoustic coating disposed about an outer surface of the motor and the controller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the controller includes a drive element and a processing element, with each in electrical communication with the power supply and the BLDC motor. In this embodiment, the drive element receives the input voltage from the power supply. The drive element is capable of providing the pulse-width-modulated input voltage to the motor and measuring the average input current to the motor and the speed of the motor. The processing element is capable altering the voltage output from the power supply based upon the average input current to the motor and the speed of the motor as measured by the drive element. Also, the controller can include a power-factor corrected converter, electrically connected between the power supply and a prime electrical power source that provides power to the power supply. By including the power-factor corrected converter, the efficiency of the power drawn from the prime power source is maximized, while conducted emissions from the system is minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In operation, a controllably alterable voltage is supplied from the power supply to the controller. The controller, in turn, supplies a pulse-width-modulated input voltage to the BLDC motor. As the input voltage is supplied to the motor, the controller measures an average input current to the motor and a speed of the motor. Based upon the average input current to the motor and the speed of the motor, the controller then alters the input voltage from the power supply. For example, the controller can alter the input voltage so that a voltage applied to the motor equals an overhead voltage plus an offset voltage. The overhead voltage depends upon at least one characteristic of the motor, such as a predetermined speed of the motor and/or a predetermined start-up torque of the motor; and the offset voltage depends upon the rates of change of the average input current to the motor and the speed of the motor. In one embodiment, the overhead voltage plus the offset voltage is not more than 40 volts above a terminal voltage across the motor.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> system for controlling a BLDC motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, according to one embodiment, includes a power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Although not necessary for the practice of the present invention, the system can also include an acoustic coating disposed about an outer surface of the motor and the controller to reduce mechanical noise in the system, as such is known. The power supply has a controllably alterable voltage output and is typically a direct current (DC) power supply. But it should be understood that the voltage supply can alternatively be an alternating current (AC) power supply with an additional voltage converter included within the system, as described below. To provide the controllably alterable voltage output, the power supply can be a variable voltage DC or AC power supply, as such are known to those skilled in the art. But in a preferred embodiment the power supply is a remotely controllable voltage DC or AC power supply, that provides a controllably alterable voltage output at a specified frequency, such as any number of power supplies from TDI&mdash;Transistor Devices Inc. of Cedar Knolls, N.J., or the Sorensen division of the Elgar Corporation of San Diego, Calif. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is in electrical communication with the power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the BLDC motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and includes a drive element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a processing element <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the drive element is a BLDC pulse-width-modulation (PWM) amplifier, such as the 509 model PWM amplifier manufactured by Pacific Scientific of Rockford, Ill., in electrical communication with the power supply and the motor. The drive element receives the voltage output from the power supply and provides a PWM input voltage to the motor in accordance with a predetermined relationship between the average current output and the PWM input voltage, as such is known. To provide proper PWM input to the motor, the drive element typically receives commutation feedback from the motor consisting of rotor magnetic field orientation information obtained from such devices as magnetic field sensors (e.g., Hall Effect Sensors) or position sensors (e.g., encoders or resolvers). Also, the drive element measures the average input current provided to the motor and the speed of the motor, such as by via a single speed absolute resolver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The processing element <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, such as a personal computer or other high level processor, is in electrical communication with the drive element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The processing element performs conventional motion control system controller functions, as such are known, including motor interfacing. In addition, the processing element controls the voltage output of the power supply, typically based upon the average input current to the BLDC motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the drive element and the speed of the motor as measured by the drive element, as described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> To maximize the real power drawn from the power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the system can, but need not, include a power-factor corrected converter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> electrically connected between the power supply and a prime electrical power source (not shown). The power-factor corrected converter can be a stand-alone device or included within the power supply. The power-factor corrected converter reduces harmonic content and/or aligns the phase angle of the motor current as reflected through the PWM voltage so it is in phase with the output voltage of the prime power supply. In addition, as used in embodiments employing an AC power supply, power-factor corrected converters can additionally reduce the harmonic content and/or align the converted AC voltage for use by the drive element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the BLDC motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably connected to a load <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to which the mechanical energy generated by the motor is transferred. But if the motor is not connected to the load, the motor can act as a generator to produce electrical energy as the rotor freely spins. The faster the rotor spins, the more electrical energy that the motor can generate. This electrical energy increases the voltage drop across the motor inductance and, therefore, increases the ripple current, which increases the EMI and, thus, the noise. In this regard, to dissipate the electrical energy otherwise generated by the motor, the motor is preferably connected to a load that is frictionally dissipating in nature to an extent that the motor does not generate any voltage above the controller input. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the operation of the BLDC motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can generally be modeled by a schematic circuit diagram including the input voltage to the motor, V<highlight><subscript>in</subscript></highlight>, a motor inductance, L, a resistance of the stator windings of the motor, R<highlight><subscript>winding</subscript></highlight>, and a terminal voltage drop across the motor, V<highlight><subscript>out</subscript></highlight>. Taking the closed loop voltage across the modeled BLDC motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the voltage drop across the motor inductance, V<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>, can be represented as a function of the input voltage and the terminal voltage as follows:</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the effect lowering the input voltage to a BLDC motor has on the EMI and, thus, the vibration noise caused by the ripple current produced in the motor running at a speed of 1800 revolutions per minute. The graph compares the noise vibration of the motor with a peak voltage of 315 volts (curve <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>), and with reduced voltages of 127 volts (curve <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>), 40 volts (curve <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>) and without any input voltage to calibrate the background energy component (curve <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>). As illustrated, the level of motor vibration decreases substantially as the input voltage is reduced from the peak voltage of 315 volts down to an input voltage of zero volts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Also as illustrated from the modeled BLDC motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the terminal voltage of the motor, V<highlight><subscript>out</subscript></highlight>, depends upon the voltage drop across the stator windings. But as the rotor rotates within the stator, a back electromotive force (EMF) builds in the motor and causes an additional voltage drop that depends upon a characteristic voltage constant of the motor and the speed of the motor. Therefore, the total terminal voltage drop across the motor varies and can generally be expressed by equation (5) as follows:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>out</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&equals;I&times;R</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>winding</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&plus;K</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>e</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&times;S</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(5)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In equation (5), the EMF is expressed as the product of the voltage constant specific to the motor, K<highlight><subscript>e</subscript></highlight>, and the speed of the motor, S<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>, and the average input current to the motor is represented by I. Because the terminal voltage across the motor varies with the average current through the stator windings and the speed of the motor, in order to alter the input voltage to the motor so that it approaches the terminal voltage, within limits described below, the input voltage to the motor must be alterable depending upon the average current through the stator windings and the speed of the motor. Thus, the terminal voltage and the input voltage should rise and fall together, with the input voltage tracking the terminal voltage and separated by a predetermined or specified voltage, V<highlight><subscript>spec.</subscript></highlight>, which represents a specified allowable voltage drop across the motor inductance, V<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in operation, the controllably alterable voltage output from the power supply <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is input into the drive element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the controller <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>). In embodiments including the power-factor corrected converter <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the drive element outputs a PWM voltage to the BLDC motor <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> based upon the voltage input into the drive element (block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>). As the drive element supplies the PWM voltage, the drive element measures an average current output to the BLDC motor and a speed of the rotor of the BLDC motor, and sends this information to the processing element <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the controller (block <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>). The processing element, in turn, calculates the terminal voltage across the motor and transmits commands to the power supply to alter the voltage output from the power supply to keep the voltage output from the power supply a specified level, preferably no more than 40 volts, above the terminal voltage of the motor, as described below (block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>). Once the output voltage from the power supply is such that it is the specified level above the terminal voltage, the controller commands the power supply in a steady state until the load <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> connected to the motor alters the speed of the motor and/or the torque of the motor (which will alter the average current through the stator windings). As the load alters the speed and/or torque of the motor, the controller acts accordingly to alter the voltage output from the power supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Controlling a fixed voltage, V<highlight><subscript>spec</subscript></highlight>, above that which is required by the motor speed and torque provides the system with a predetermined rate of response to the dynamics of the load connected to the system. During operation, a fluctuation in the load requires the controller to adjust the average current in the windings. Therefore, the fixed voltage, V<highlight><subscript>spec</subscript></highlight>, is selected based upon a desired dynamic response of the system in response to changes in the load. For example, V<highlight><subscript>spec </subscript></highlight>can be selected based upon a desired the rate at which the average input current to the motor changes which, like the voltage drop across the motor inductance, can be expressed as a function of the inductance of the windings and the change in the average current across the windings, as illustrated by equation (6):

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Since the specified voltage, V<highlight><subscript>spec.</subscript></highlight>, is a constant, such as 40 volts, the controller can determine the desired voltage output by the power supply by measuring the average current through the stator windings and the speed of the motor. The controller then provides feedback signals to the power supply instructing the power supply to produce the desired voltage output. Since the overhead voltage, V<highlight><subscript>overhead</subscript></highlight>, is a constant per equation (7), the changes in the voltage output by the power supply are attributable to changes in the offset voltage, V<highlight><subscript>offset</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As an example, consider a BLDC motor that has a terminal voltage drop of 150 volts when it operates at a specified speed and torque of the maximum allowable for the motor. A conventional fixed power supply might output a voltage into the drive element as high as 320 volts. Therefore, the voltage across the motor inductance would equal 170 volts and, therefore, produce a large ripple current. But using equation (4), if the controller of the present invention tracked the voltage output from the power supply to limit the voltage across the motor inductance to a specified level of 40 volts above the 150 volt terminal voltage, the system could reduce the ripple current 23.6% or 12.6 dB. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the system, controller and method of the present invention reduce the ripple current by controlling the voltage provided to the controller from a power supply. In contrast to other methods to reduce the ripple current, the system of the present invention reduces the EMI and, thus, the ripple current and vibration noise caused thereby, by employing a power supply with a controllably alterable output voltage to reduce the voltage drop across the motor inductance. The present invention also reduces the ripple current without making costly and large schedule changes to the system, and operates without additional costly and robust filters to filter out the high frequency noise. Also, while the system utilizes the speed of the motor to determine many of the parameters used to control the voltage provided to the controller, it should be understood that the torque of the motor could be used to determine the same parameters without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
