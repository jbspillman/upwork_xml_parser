<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the offset printing blankets, and more particularly, to tubular offset lithographic printing blankets and methods for manufacturing the same. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A web offset printing press typically includes a plate cylinder, a blanket cylinder and an impression cylinder supported for rotation in the press. The plate cylinder carries a printing plate having a rigid surface defining an image to be printed. The blanket cylinder typically carries a printing blanket having an outer print layer, for example of rubber, which contacts the printing plate at a nip between the plate cylinder and the blanket cylinder. A web to be printed moves through a nip between the blanket cylinder and the impression cylinder. Ink is applied to the surface of the printing plate on the plate cylinder. An inked image is picked up by the printing blanket at the nip between the blanket cylinder and the plate cylinder, and is transferred from the printing blanket to the web at the nip between the blanket cylinder and the impression cylinder. The impression cylinder can be another blanket cylinder for printing on the opposite side of the web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A conventional printing blanket is manufactured as a flexible flat sheet. Such a printing blanket is mounted on a blanket cylinder by wrapping the sheet around the blanket cylinder and by attaching the opposite ends of the sheet to the blanket cylinder in an axially extending gap in the blanket cylinder. The adjoining opposite ends of the sheet define a gap extending axially along the length of the printing blanket. The gap moves through the nip between the blanket cylinder and the plate cylinder, and also moves through the nip between the blanket cylinder and the impression cylinder, each time the blanket cylinder rotates. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When the leading and trailing edges of the gap at the printing blanket move through the nip between the blanket cylinder and an adjacent cylinder, pressure between the blanket cylinder and the adjacent cylinder is relieved and established, respectively. The repeated relieving and establishing of pressure at the gap causes vibrations and shock loads in the cylinders and throughout the printing press. Such vibrations and shock loads detrimentally affect print quality. For example, at the time that the gap relieves and establishes pressure at the nip between the blanket cylinder and the plate cylinder, printing may be taking place on the web moving through the nip between the blanket cylinder and the impression cylinder. Any movement of the blanket cylinder or the printing blanket caused by the relieving and establishing of pressure at that time can smear the image which is transferred from the printing blanket to the web. Likewise, when the gap in the printing blanket moves through the nip between the blanket cylinder and the impression cylinder, an image being picked up from the printing plate by the printing blanket at the other nip can be smeared. The result of the vibrations and shock loads caused by the gap in the printing blanket has been an undesirably low limit to the speed at which printing presses can be run with acceptable print quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In response to these deficiencies in conventional flat printing blankets, gapless tubular printing blankets were developed by the assignee of the present invention. These gapless tubular printing blankets are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,768,990, 5,553,541, 5,440,981, 5,429,048, 5,323,702, and 5,304,267. These tubular blankets however have required that the print layer and compressible layers be supported by a stiff inner sleeve, for example made of nickel. The tubular blankets thus were not flexible, in that the inner surface of the sleeve could not contact itself or collapse without damaging the layers of the blanket. The tubular blankets thus need to be stored in a tubular shape, taking up valuable space in a press room or print shop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,654,100 discloses an offset rubber-blanket sleeve with rubber as a base material, reinforced by layer inserts embedded therein, such as a spiral winding to provide similar strength to a fiberglass or metallic sleeve. The sleeve is thus not collapsible. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Commonly-assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/472,337, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein, describes gapless tubular printing blankets produced continuously and cut to length as desired. The sleeve and print layer are &ldquo;continuously&rdquo; formed in that the sleeve forming station continues to form an additional portion of the sleeve while the print layer forming station applies the print layer to the previously formed portion of the sleeve. Wound tapes or cross-head extruders are used to apply various layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 09/685,035 discloses a machine for winding a sleeve, and is also incorporated by reference herein. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a device for manufacturing a preferred lithographic continuous-process gapless tubular flexible printing blanket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this regard, the term &ldquo;continuous process&rdquo; indicates that the process creates a continuous tubular blanket of undetermined axial length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A sleeve forming station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> forming a flexible sleeve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The sleeve forming station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a rotation and translation device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, for example one having a series of axially-translating and rotating slats, as described in the incorporated-by-reference U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/716,696, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> In a first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and in more detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, sleeve forming station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a flexible polymer tape <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, for example made of urethane, which is wound over slates of the rotation and translation device so as to form a flexible application layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> On the application layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is deposited a polymer using a liquid applicator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which may be for example a spraying device. At a location <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the deposited polymer is still in a flowable form, and at a location <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> the liquid has cured so as to harden. The polymer may be a self-cure polyurethane, for example, or a UV-cure polyurethane, in which case UV light is applied to the outer surface of the sleeve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the flexible application layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the polymer together form sleeve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Preferably, both the layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and the polymer have a hardness of at least 70 Shore A and most preferably of about 70 Shore D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, tape <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> need not align perfectly, and some of the polymer can flow into interstices <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. This is advantageous, since alignment of the tape can be difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an alternate embodiment of sleeve-forming station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A release tape <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, with for example a TEFLON outer coating slides over the outer surface of rotating and translation device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. On top of the application layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> formed by the TEFLON tape is deposited a polymer by a liquid applicator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the polymer preferably being urethane. The polymer then cures, for example using UV light, while still on application layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>. The cured polymer thus forms tubular sleeve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The release tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be pulled out the front end of the sleeve forming station <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown by arrow <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> An alternate to the tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for application layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is a release agent, for example dried TEFLON spray, for example 0.0001&Prime; in thickness. This layer then can remain as part of sleeve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, or can remain part of rotating and translating device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Application layer <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> also could be a permanent coating on the rotating and translating device <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, such as TEFLON-impregnated nickel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, over sleeve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is applied a compressible layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of, for example, UV-curing urethane, commercially available from the Bomar Specialties Company of Connecticut, for example. The urethane may be applied for example in liquid form from a polymer liquid applicator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which for example may be a spraying device. The radiation-curing urethane may be premixed before application, and then blown with a blowing agent or carbon dioxide for example to add compressibility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> A smoothing station <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, for example a doctor blade or planing device, can reduce undulations in the applied compressible layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is then cured using a radiation source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, for example a UV light source. An electron beam or other radiation could be used depending on the type of polymer to be cured. Layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> then cures to form the compressible layer of blanket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> A second smoothing station <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> then may contact the urethane layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to smooth layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to reduce imperfections such as undulations. Smoothing station <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be, for example, a grinding device or surface planer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Over the compressible layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> between after grinding device may deposited, for example by a liquid applicator device, a reinforcing layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). The durometer of the reinforcing layer, which also may be urethane, preferably is greater than 70 shore A, and preferably about 70 shore D, similar to that of the sleeve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> A second liquid applicator <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> similar to device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> then forms a print layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> over the compressible layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The urethane of the print layer may have a shore A durometer value of about 60, for example. The deposited print layer forms a seamless and gapless layer when it sets. If desired, a scraper and/or a grinding device may be used to correct or reduce any imperfections such as undulations in the print layer. Both the print layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the reinforcing layer may be made from radiation-curing polymers, for example, and a radiation source may be provided after the respective applicators. Ribbon casting can also provide the print layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and reinforcing layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Once the print layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is complete, the blanket continues moving in the direction of arrow <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> until a desired length is reached, at which time the blanket is cut, for example by a rotating cutter or saw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional view of the blanket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when compressed by an outside force, the blanket having a sleeve <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, compressible layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, reinforcing layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and print layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As shown an innermost surface <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of the printing blanket <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can collapse, so that the surface contacts itself along circumferential sections that normally would not be in contact when the sleeve is round. Cardboard inserts can be provided in spaces <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> so that pinching of the blanket is prevented. Due to the sleeve construction, the blanket returns to its tubular shape when not compressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The compressible layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be made compressible in any manner known in the art, including for example, through the use of microspheres, blowing agents, foaming agents, or leaching. Examples of such methods are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,768,990, 5,553,541, 5,440,981, 5,429,048, 5,323,702, and 5,304,267. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As used herein, the term print layer, or printing layer refers to an polymeric material such as urethane which is suitable for transferring an image from a lithographic printing plate or other image carrier to web or sheet of material, with such print quality as the particular printing application requires. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that a blanket in accordance with the present invention might also include multiple compressible layers, multiple build up layers, or multiple reinforcing layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The reinforcing layer also may be formed by winding fabric or plastic tape, cords or threads around the work piece. </paragraph>
