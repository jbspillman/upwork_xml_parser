<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The illustrated, about &lsqb;sic&rsqb; essentially U-shaped protective-door handle according to the invention comprises two side legs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which hold a central leg <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and can be fastened on a protective door via screws which are plugged through corresponding sockets <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and held in the latter by their heads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The central leg <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a plug-in peg <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> on each end side for plugging into a corresponding, lateral, sleeve-shaped recess of the respective side leg <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and, adjacent to the plug-in peg <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a respective stop section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&Prime; for resting against the corresponding side leg <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The central leg <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, whose plug-in peg <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> adjacent to the stop section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; is pinned, and therefore also rotationally secured, to the adjacent side leg <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> via a pin <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, is provided in the region of the stop section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; with a release push button <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for unlocking the safety tumbler of the protective door to which the protective-door handle is fitted, the release push button <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> being screwed into a threaded hole <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> running perpendicular with respect to the longitudinal axis of the central leg <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the actuating element <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> of said release push button being manually actuable via a flexible or rigid tap <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is fitted on it. The threaded hole <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> opens into a wiring opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is open toward the outer circumference of the central leg <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and in which the electric connections <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the release pushbutton <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are situated and also into which the electric connections <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of two operating-state display diodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (for example, green LED for locked protective door, red LED for unlocked protective door) run. The release pushbutton <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the operating-state display diodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are connected to corresponding, electric supply lines (not illustrated), which lead to a corresponding controlling means for the safety tumblers of the protective doors and for the means for enabling the protected machine, installation or the like to be switched on, via corresponding cables which are soldered to the electric connections <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> within the wiring opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, and the wiring opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is filled with a casting compound which encloses, in an electrically insulating manner, the electric contacts which are situated therein and are connected to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It may also be expedient to conduct the electric supply line through one of the side legs <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&mdash;instead of leading it directly out of the wiring opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The central leg <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is then provided with an axial hole <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which extends from one end as far as the wiring opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and which holds a cable <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is connected, ie is soldered, in the wiring opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to the electric connections <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and is connected at the other end to a plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> which is screwed into a hole extension <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provided with thread. The plug <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is essentially held here by a depression <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> on the end side of the central leg <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and of the adjacent side leg <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The plug-in peg <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> adjacent to the stop section <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>&prime; is, when an emergency-stop switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is additionally also to be provided for the protected machine, mechanical installation or the like, designed as a hollow peg whose cavity is connected to the wiring opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A socket <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which is likewise pinned to the side leg <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and is intended for the emergency-stop switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then inserted into the hollow plug-in peg <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, from the side of the side leg <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the contact block <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> together with its electric connections <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> being accessible from the wiring opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the cavity in the plug-in peg <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and being connectable to corresponding electric lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In addition to the release pushbutton <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> one or more other pushbuttons for additional functions may also be provided, said pushbuttons likewise being wired via the wiring opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The release pushbutton <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may also be arranged at the point where the emergency-stop switch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is situated in the exemplary embodiment illustrated. In this position, the release pushbutton <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can then be held by the hole of the hollow plug-in peg <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and wired via the wiring opening <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is obvious to the expert that the exemplary embodiment which is illustrated and described is not intended to restrict the invention thereto, but that many changes and modifications are possible without departing from the spirit of the invention as defined in the claims. </paragraph>
