<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a cookie making implement and, more particularly, to a dough cutting and decorating tool and the method for its use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Cookies have long been a popular desert or snack item. Their generally small size and firm consistency allows enthusiastic eaters to enjoy cookies without resort to utensils such as forks or spoons. This aspect makes cookies particularly popular among children and their families. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Cookies also tend to be relatively easy to make, so that making&mdash;and eating&mdash;cookies has been a favorite activity for families with children. While artistically decorating cookies may be merely time consuming for adults, it is a difficult task for young children who have not yet acquired the steady hand and artistic vision needed to produce consistently pleasing cookie decorating results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In addition, decorating options have moved beyond the traditional icings and sprinkles and include what is known as &ldquo;edible paints.&rdquo; Edible paints have become increasingly popular for a number of children&apos;s activities and typically include a food color mixed with, e.g., powdered milk or egg yolks&mdash;while not specifically intended as a food item, edible paints provide additional options for food decorating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a single cookie making implement that may be used to both shape the unbaked cookie dough and decorate the baked cookie. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> More particularly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a combination cookie cutter and decorating tool that is readily useable by children and allows the user to easily and consistently decorate the baked cookie shapes made with the cutter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a cookie making implement that facilitates the decoration of the cookie with edible paints. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is a related object to provide a method for cutting cookie dough and decorating a baked cookie using a single implement. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> These objects, as well as others which will become apparent upon reference to the following detailed description and accompanying drawings, are provided by a dough cutting and decorating tool that includes a generally flat base with a continuous raised cutting edge defining a shape extending from one side of the base. A raised printing surface extends from the other side of the base, with the printing surface having a pattern configured to fit within the shape defined by the raised cutting edge on the other side of the base. In certain preferred embodiments, the cutting edge coincides with the peripheral edge of the base, while the printing surface is made of a resilient material, such as a compressible cellular foam material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A method for using the dough cutting and decorating tool for cutting a defined shape from a generally flat and soft dough-like material is also disclosed in which the continuous raised edge of the cutting implement is pressed into the dough-like material to cut a defined shape therefrom. The cut material is then baked and a colorant is applied to the raised printing surface of the cutting implement, which is then placed in face-to-face registration with the baked dough. The raised printing surface is then pressed against the baked dough to transfer the colorant from the raised printing surface to the baked item.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Turning to the figures of the drawings, there is seen a dough cutting and decorating implement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. The device includes a dough cutting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on one face and a decorating portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the opposite face. The dough cutting portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a generally planar base <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from which a continuous raised cutting edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> defining a shape extends. In the illustrated embodiment, the cutting edge coincides with the peripheral edge of the base and defines the outline of a teddy bear. Other shapes, of course, may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The decorating portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a raised surface that has a pattern configured to fit within the shape defined by the raised cutting edge. In particular, a plurality of raised printing surfaces <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are shown that correspond to the arms, legs, and head of the teddy bear, as well as a vest worn by the bear. The raised printing surface is preferably made of a resilient material such as a compressive cellular foam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In use, the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used to cut a shape in the figure of the bear from a soft material that is rolled out in advance. The soft material is usually cookie dough, but could include other, non-edible substances. The dough is rolled out in advance and the cookie is cut with the dough cutting side <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by compressing the continuous raised edge <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into the dough and removing the excess dough for later use. The dough is baked in the traditional manner, resulting in a hardening or stiffening of the dough in the baked cookie. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The baked cookie is then decorated using the second portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the device. A colorant, such as a food color or edible paint is applied to the raised printing surface <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which is then pressed against the baked cookie to transfer the food color or edible paint to the cookie. While the disclosed device creates a cookie that is symmetrical about a center line, non-symmetrical shapes may also be used. It merely requires that the cookie be flipped after baking to have the face-up shape correspond to the shape of the decorating stamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The cutter portion of the device may be made of plastic by injection molding or of a stamped sheet metal. The printing surface may be molded directly to the cutter. Preferably it is made separately of a softer material than the cookie cutter portion, which may then be affixed to the cookie cutter portion by a suitable adhesive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in terms of a preferred embodiment, there is no intent to limit it to the same. Instead, the invention is defined by the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
