<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to access doors and more particularly to access doors for aerospace vehicles that are opened by an external umbilical for purposes such as pre-launch environmental control. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Aerospace launch vehicles such as rockets comprise a plurality of access doors and covers through their outer moldline surfaces for access to internal structure and subsystems. One type of access door of the known art provides internal access to a launch vehicle, which may include an internal manifold and ducting, for pre-launch environmental control such as air conditioning. In operation, an external detachable umbilical forces the access door open and induces a flow of air from the umbilical into the launch vehicle through the internal manifolds and ducting. When the air flow must be discontinued, the umbilical is removed from the launch vehicle and the access door automatically closes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The access door must be capable of closing automatically because the umbilical is removed during lift-off of the launch vehicle. Accordingly, the access doors must be opened by an external umbilical and must further be self-closing or closed by a remote device. Moreover, the access doors must be capable of remaining closed during launch, thereby withstanding the dynamic, thermal, and pressure environments induced during flight. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One self-closing access door of the known art uses a pan-shaped plug that is circumferentially spring-loaded with extension springs to hold the door closed. Generally, the springs are mounted to the rear of the plug and to the internal moldline of the vehicle structure. When the door is forced open by an external source, the rear of the plug moves which extends the springs. When the external source is removed, the springs force the door closed against the vehicle structure. However, there is no additional mechanism to automatically secure the door to the vehicle structure after the external source is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In one form, the access door comprises twenty (20) extension springs positioned around the circumference of the plug, along with a plurality of additional structure and fasteners to support operation of the access door. As a result, the access door is relatively complicated and requires a substantial amount of resources for fabrication and assembly, especially at the vehicle level. The completed access door assembly in one known form weighs approximately 15 pounds, which is relatively heavy for an aerospace application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In operation, the extension springs are designed to maintain a minimum load, i.e. prevent the door from opening under a certain load, while the door is closed. A load approximately four times the minimum load is required to fully open the door due to the number of extension springs employed. Accordingly, if a launch vehicle increases in size and must be designed for more extreme environments during flight, the access door of the known art will only further increase in complexity and cost. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Other known art access doors employ externally mounted spring-loaded hinges, wherein the external umbilical system lifts the door up and swings the door into an open position to induce the air flow. When the air flow is to be discontinued, the umbilical releases the door and the spring-loaded hinge forces the door closed against the outer moldline surface of the vehicle. Unfortunately, since the access door must swing out and into the path of the umbilical, the access door may interfere with the umbilical and cause problems with release of the umbilical during lift-off. As a result, both the umbilical system and the launch vehicle may be damaged, which could possibly threaten the safety of flight operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Additional known art access doors comprise a sliding guillotine door, wherein the umbilical system slides the door up and open to induce the fluid flow. However, the design of the sliding guillotine door is relatively complex in order to withstand the flight environment after launch, and the probability of the sliding door binding during flight operations is relatively high. As a result, the sliding guillotine door is undesirable for a variety of launch vehicles and environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Known art access doors, therefore, are relatively complex and may be incapable of withstanding certain launch environments. As a result, access doors have been structurally complex, which results in heavier and more expensive launch vehicles. Furthermore, access doors of the known art increase the probability of failure of the umbilical system and/or the access door during launch operations when the umbilical fails to release from the launch vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there remains a need in the art for a reliable self-closing access door that comprises a relatively simple structure in order to reduce weight and further to simplify fabrication and assembly for reduced costs. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one preferred form, the present invention provides a self-closing access door that comprises two (2) door panels secured to a spring-loaded hinge that is further secured to surrounding structure. The spring-loaded hinge holds the door closed against the surrounding structure, and when an external source such as a umbilical engages one or both of the panels, the panels are forced open against the forces applied by the spring-loaded hinge. When the external source is removed from the door panels, the spring-loaded hinge forces the door panels closed against the surrounding structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The self-closing access door further comprises a plurality of latches that are attached to the door panels to firmly secure the door panels to the surrounding structure. The latches are preferably attached to the door panels using latch supports, which are generally L-shaped brackets attached to the interior of the door panels. The latches further comprise latch hooks, which specifically engage the surrounding structure to secure the door panels in the closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In another preferred form, the self-closing access door of the present invention comprises a cover plate that is attached to the surrounding structure. The spring-loaded hinge is secured to the cover plate rather than directly to the surrounding structure, and the latches engage the cover plate to firmly secure the door panels in the closed position. Generally, the cover plate is circular in shape and defines a hollow center portion. The cover plate further comprises a lateral support that extends across the hollow center portion, an inner lip, and an outer lip. The spring-loaded hinge is secured along the lateral support and thus extends across the hollow center portion of the cover plate. The outer lip is attached to the surrounding structure, and the latches engage the inner lip to secure the door panels in the closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> To limit the overall distance that the door panels are opened, the spring-loaded hinge further comprises a door stop. The door stop generally defines a &ldquo;C&rdquo; configuration, thereby having a flange on each side. Additionally, the door stop is separately attached to the spring-loaded hinge in the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The door panels are preferably secured to the spring-loaded hinge using rivets, and the spring-loaded hinge further comprises a tab portion on each side of the spring-loaded hinge adjacent the door stop. Accordingly, when the door panels are opened a certain predetermined distance, the tab portions along the spring-loaded hinge engage the flanges of the door stop to prevent further movement of the door panels. The door stop is also preferably riveted to the spring-loaded hinge, although other attachment methods known in the art such as adhesive bonding may also be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> When the self-closing access door is assembled to the launch vehicle, the hinge-line of the spring-loaded hinge is aligned with the direction of flight of the launch vehicle. The hinge-line is aligned with the direction of flight, and also the direction of the air stream, so that the probability of aerodynamic forces opening the door panels during flight is minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In operation, the latches are manually or automatically disengaged, and an external umbilical engages the outer surface of the door panels to apply an inward force to open the access door until the tab portions of the spring-loaded hinge engage the flanges of the door stop. Once the door panels are open, the umbilical system induces fluid flow, e.g. air conditioning, into a manifold and additional ducting within the launch vehicle. When the fluid flow must be discontinued, the umbilical is removed from the door panels and the spring-loaded hinge forces the door panels closed against the inner lip of the cover plate. The latch hooks then engage the inner lip of the cover plate to firmly secure the door panels to the cover plate so that the door panels do not open during flight operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As a result, a relatively simple and reliable self-closing access door is provided that has a minimal number of parts and is relatively light weight. The self-closing access door is furthermore simple to fabricate and assemble to the launch vehicle, thereby providing both weight and cost savings over access doors of the known art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The following description of the preferred embodiments is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, the self-closing access door of the present invention is illustrated and generally indicated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. As shown, the self-closing access door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a first door panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a second door panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which are joined by a spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Generally, the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are opened by applying an external source in the direction of arrow A to either or both of door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When the external source is removed, spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> forces the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> closed against surrounding structure such as the cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as illustrated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The application of the self-closing access door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to an aerospace vehicle should not be construed as limiting the invention; rather, the application to aerospace is merely illustrative of one structure and one operating environment in which the present invention has particular utility. The self-closing access door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention can further be employed with a wide variety of applications that require a self-closing access door. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As shown, the spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is further attached to the cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which is secured to surrounding structure (not shown) of the launch vehicle. Accordingly, the spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is secured to the inside of the vehicle and is thus an internal hinge rather than an external hinge. Alternately, the spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be secured directly to the surrounding structure of the vehicle rather than to the cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises an outer lip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is attached to the surrounding structure of the vehicle, and an inner lip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that is used to further secure the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as more fully described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The self-closing access door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention further comprises a plurality of latches <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that are secured to the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As shown, latch supports <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are used to secure the latches <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Although four (4) latches <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are illustrated, any number of latches <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be employed according to specific design requirements of an access door application. Accordingly, the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are firmly secured to the cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> using latches <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> as described in greater detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> further comprises a latch hook <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that engages the inner lip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to firmly secure door panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As shown, latch hook <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> engages inner lip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> when the door panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is in the closed position, and as a result, a limited force from an external source, i.e. aerodynamic loads, applied in the direction of arrow Y will not open the door panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As a result, door panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is held securely closed from both the force of spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as well as the latches <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As further shown, latch supports <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> comprise an &ldquo;L&rdquo; configuration, wherein the lower flange <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is fastened to the door panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and the upper flange <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is fastened to the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The latch supports <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are preferably fastened using solid rivets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> as shown, however, other fastening methods known in the art, such as adhesive bonding, may also be employed. As illustrated, flush-head rivets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are used to fasten the latch supports <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the door panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to allow the door panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to close flush against the inner lip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Protruding-head rivets <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are preferably used to fasten the latch supports <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the latches <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> due to their lower acquisition and installation cost. Alternately, latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may comprise a unitized configuration (not shown) wherein the lower flange <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the upper flange <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are an integral part of the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is disengaged by depressing the latch hook <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrow X such that the latch hook <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is positioned away from the inner lip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as shown. Once the latch hook <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is free from the inner lip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, an external source may be applied to the door panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrow Y to open the door panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the latch hook <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is preferably a thin gauge flexible, yet durable, material such as stainless steel. Preferably, the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a thickness of approximately 0.060 inches (1.524 mm) for one application of the present invention to a launch vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> With the preferable material and configuration of the latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, approximately one pound of force is required to sufficiently depress the latch hook <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in order to open door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Additionally, each latch <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can withstand approximately 28 pounds of combined shock and pressure loads, which equates to approximately 112 pounds of combined pressure and shock loading that the self-closing access door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can withstand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Depending on the size of the self-closing access door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the magnitude and direction of aerodynamic loads, the number, material, and configuration of latches <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may vary accordingly. Furthermore, other devices may also be employed to firmly secure the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or surrounding structure of the vehicle, including but not limited to, metallic hook and loop fasteners, other latch configurations, magnetic fasteners, and other mechanical fasteners. Additionally, the latches <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may alternately be secured directly to the structure of the vehicle, provided that structure has a feature similar to inner lip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that latch hooks <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may engage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> further comprises a door stop <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> attached thereto. Generally, door stop <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is provided to limit the distance that door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may move when opened by an external source. The door stop <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is generally a &ldquo;C&rdquo; configuration that defines flanges <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extending therefrom. Furthermore, the spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> comprises tab portions <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> adjacent the door stop <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, when the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are opened in the direction of arrow A a predetermined distance, the tab portions <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> contact the flanges <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing further movement of the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The door stop <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is also preferably attached to the spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> using rivets <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The number and spacing of rivets <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> depends on the structural loads applied to spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, in addition to manufacturing and supportability requirements, and will vary accordingly. Further, the rivets <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are preferably a flush-head configuration as illustrated so that the rivet head does not protrude from the vehicle and into the air stream during flight operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be adhesively bonded to the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Additionally, door stop <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may also be adhesively bonded to the spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> rather than using the rivets <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> as shown. Moreover, the door stop <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may also be an integral feature of spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> rather than a separate piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> further comprises a lateral support <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that extends across a hollow center portion thereof. The lateral support <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> provides a support for the spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, wherein the spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is attached to the lateral support <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> using rivets <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> as shown. Accordingly, the internal loads within the spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are transferred through the lateral support <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and are then transferred to the surrounding structure of the vehicle. The rivets <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are the same type of rivets that are used to secure door stop <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> as previously described. Accordingly, the rivets <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are a flush-head configuration to minimize aerodynamic drag during flight operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As further shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> defines a hinge-line <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that extends along the direction of spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In operation, the hinge-line <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is aligned with the direction of flight of the aerospace vehicle and also the direction of the air stream during flight, so that the probability of aerodynamic forces opening the door panels is minimized. Additionally, the hinge-line <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may also be aligned with internal forces that are also in the direction of the hinge-line <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for load-path continuity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Alternately, spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be directly attached to the cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> or to surrounding structure of the vehicle rather than to a lateral support <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As a result, the cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the surrounding structure will be thicker and thus heavier in order to support the loads introduced by the spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the external source when the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are opened. Although the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are shown receded from the inner lip <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may further include a feature commonly known in the art as a &ldquo;rabbet&rdquo; (not shown) in order to maintain a smooth outer moldline surface near the self-closing access door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may alternately be secured directly to the surrounding structure of the vehicle, wherein the vehicle structure may similarly incorporate the feature of a rabbet so that the entire self-closing access door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is flush with the outer moldline of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, the self-closing access door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is generally opened by an external umbilical <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as shown. The external umbilical <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> abuts the outer moldline of the vehicle structure <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, wherein a manifold <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and additional ducting (not shown) are positioned inside the vehicle structure <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> adjacent the external umbilical <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In operation, the latches are first disengaged, and an external source such as a fork-shaped protrusion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is applied to open the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Once the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are open, fluid flow <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> (i.e., air conditioning) is induced through the self-closing access door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and into the manifold <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> as illustrated. The fluid flow <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> then travels further through additional ducting within the vehicle as necessary. When the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> must be closed, the fork-shaped protrusion <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is removed and the spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> forces the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> closed. Furthermore, the latches <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> firmly secure the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the closed position for subsequent flight operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the spring-loaded hinge <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a commercial off the shelf (COTS) item. The cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the door panels <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the door stop <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the latches <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the latch supports <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are all preferably an aluminum material. Such parts are preferably formed from sheet aluminum, however, the parts may alternately be machined aluminum. Alternately, the parts may be a composite material, which may be formed using a variety of techniques commonly known in the art. For higher temperature applications, the parts may be a material such as titanium, an -imide based composite, or other high temperature material commonly known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The outer lip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is preferably attached to the surrounding structure of the vehicle using conventional fastening techniques commonly known in the art. The cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be pre-drilled prior to assembly or may alternately be match-drilled on assembly. Alternately, the cover plate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be adhesively bonded to the surrounding structure of the vehicle or attached by other means commonly known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Although the self-closing access door <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the present invention preferably comprises two door panels, any number of door panels may be employed depending on the specific access door application. Moreover, any number of geometrical shapes for the door panels, surrounding structure, and cover plate may be employed as an alternative to the circular shapes illustrated herein. For example, access doors requiring a low radar signature may employ a diamond or triangular geometry for the door panels, surrounding structure, and cover plate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a simple and reliable self-closing access door is provided by the present invention. The self-closing access door is furthermore light weight with a total weight of approximately three (3) pounds in one form compared with the fifteen (15) pound pan-shaped plug access door of the known art. As a result, critical weight may be saved from the launch vehicle, thereby improving payload and performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
