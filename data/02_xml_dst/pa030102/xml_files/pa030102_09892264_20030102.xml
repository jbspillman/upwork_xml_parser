<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to variable pitch propellers used on aircraft, and more specifically, to an improved backup governing system for such propellers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Variable pitch propellers are employed on many differing types of aircraft having power plants ranging from piston engines to gas turbines. Conventionally, such systems include redundant main control systems with one of the control systems being operable to take over the pitch control function if the other main system malfunctions. Moreover, it is common practice to provide a backup governing system for the redundant main control systems, particularly where the main control systems are electronic pitch control (EPC) systems. The backup governing system should be capable of determining when a propeller overspeed condition exists and causing propeller blades to move toward a coarse pitch condition which is sufficient to slow the rate of rotation of the propeller to a maximum allowable speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In addition, the backup control system should also be capable of determining when a low pitch condition (also referred to as a &ldquo;low pitch stop&rdquo;) exists wherein the pitch of the propeller becomes less than that defined as a minimum, in-flight allowable pitch (often called &ldquo;flight idle&rdquo; pitch) and cause the propeller blades to return to a coarser pitch that is at least equal to or greater than the flight idle pitch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Still further, if the variable pitch propeller system is one where the pitch of the blades can be changed to cause a reverse thrust condition, as, for example, employed at slowing an aircraft on a runway just after having landed, the backup governing system must include provision for manually disabling the backup functions providing overspeed protection and low pitch stop. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As propeller pitch control systems, including EPC systems conventionally employ hydraulic fluid under pressure as a means for controlling the pitch of the propeller blades, it is highly desirable to provide a backup control system which is operable notwithstanding flight conditions such as a momentary loss of hydraulic power. It is also desired to eliminate mechanical gear trains or other connections between the rotating and stationary parts of the propeller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, an additional constraint is the requirement that the backup governing system interfaced with three existing pressure signals which are available to the propeller from its control. This constraint minimizes cost and enhances the ability to retrofit a system on existing propeller control systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to overcoming one or more of the above problems. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is the principal object of the invention to provide a new and improved backup governing system for a variable pitch propeller. More specifically, it is an object of the invention to provide such a system wherein the components are carried by the propeller, eliminating a mechanical interface for the backup control between rotating and stationary parts of the propeller system and which may interface with existing pressure signals in a conventional system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An exemplary embodiment of the invention achieves the foregoing object in a variable pitch propeller system that includes a rotatable propeller hub that is adapted to be driven by a prime mover. A double acting piston is carried by the hub and propeller blades having shanks journaled in the hub are provided. A linkage connects the piston to the shanks so that movement of the piston will cause rotation of the shanks within the hub. A transfer bearing is provided for providing at least first and second streams of hydraulic fluid under pressure. The first stream is adapted to be applied to one side of the piston and the second stream is adapted to be applied to the opposite side of the piston. A main control is provided for regulating the pressures of the first and second streams to set the pitch of the blades and the hub. According to the invention, there is provided a backup governing system carried by the hub and hydraulically interposed between the main control and the piston and which includes a metering valve having a metering valve member movable between a plurality of metering positions, first and second, opposing biasing elements applying oppositely directed forces to the valve member, a flyweight assembly connected to the valve member applying a speed dependent valve positioning force to the valve member in opposition to the first biasing element and in addition to the second biasing element. Also included is an actuator that is operatively associated with the second biasing element and which is operable to change the bias applied by the second biasing element to the valve member. A first stream control valve is connected to the actuator and is interposed between the transfer bearing and the piston and is operable to control the flow of the first stream to the one side of the piston. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the first stream is a stream that moves the propeller pitch towards a fine pitch condition and the second stream is a stream that moves the propeller towards a coarse pitch position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the actuator includes an actuator piston having a side hydraulically connected to the metering valve. The metering valve is operable to direct the first or fine pitch stream to the actuator piston side when the metering valve member is moved by the flyweight assembly to a predetermined position indicative of an undesirable occurrence in the operation of the system as, for example, an overspeed condition or a low pitch condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a linkage path, from the double acting piston to the flyweight assembly changes the spool of the flyweight assembly from a force control valve to a motion control valve whenever a low pitch stop is required. When this occurs the flyweight assembly simply becomes another link in the path. The link that follows the cam has enough mass so that it always follows the cam, thus, movement of the double acting piston, during a low pitch condition will move the spool valve directly without any spring or flyweight force influencing the motion of the valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the invention contemplates that the actuator and the first or fine pitch stream control valve include a piston valve having a piston surface hydraulically connected to the metering valve to receive the first or fine pitch stream when the metering valve is moved to a predetermined position by the flyweight assembly. Also included is a valve surface for halting flow of the first or fine pitch stream to the double acting piston when the metering valve is moved to the predetermined position by the flyweight assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the metering valve is a spool valve and the metering valve member is a spool having opposite ends. The first biasing element and the flyweight assembly are connected to one of the spool ends and the second biasing element is connected to the other of the spool ends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the biasing elements are springs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The invention also contemplates the provision of a reverse enabling valve hydraulically interposed between the actuator piston and the metering valve and operable to prevent the first or fine pitch stream from being applied to the actuator piston side. In this embodiment, the reverse enabling valve may be a hydraulically operated valve responsive to a hydraulic signal in the form of a third stream of hydraulic fluid passing through the transfer bearing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The invention also contemplates the provision of a hydraulic discharge path in fluid communication with the double acting piston fine pitch side, a flow limiter in the discharge path, and a valve operated bypass about the flow limiter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The flow limiter may be an orifice and the discharge path operates as a hydraulically operated pitch delay valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Other objects and advantages will become apparent from the following specification taken in connection with the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> An exemplary embodiment of a variable pitch propeller system made according to the invention is illustrated in the drawings and with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is seen to include a rotatable hub, generally designated <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, constituting the rotatable side of the variable pitch propeller system, and a stationary side, generally designated <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, of conventional construction. The hub <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is rotatable about an axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and is driven by any suitable power plant, most often a gas turbine engine (not shown). A shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is bolted as by bolts <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the hub <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is journaled for rotation about the axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> by bearings including a transfer bearing, generally designated <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of conventional construction. The transfer bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, in addition to journaling function, serves as an interface between the hub <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the stationary part <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the propeller system by serving to transmit, as is conventional, three streams of hydraulic fluid. One such stream commands the propeller system towards a coarse pitch and is designated P<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>. Another stream is operative to bias the propeller towards a fine pitch condition and is designated P<highlight><subscript>f</subscript></highlight>. The third stream is a governor disable signal and is designated P<highlight><subscript>gds</subscript></highlight>. The stream&apos;s P<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>and P<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>will be at selected variable, elevated pressures controlled by an EPC (not shown) or other conventional control while the stream P<highlight><subscript>gds </subscript></highlight>will typically be at one or the other of two different pressure values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The shaft <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes an interior cavity <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in which a valving system, generally designated <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is contained. The valving system <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> communicates in a manner to be seen with a shaft/transfer tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a concentric transfer tube <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> having a central flow path or conduit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and a concentric flow path <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, formed by the shaft/transfer tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the transfer tube <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which respectively receive the streams P<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>and P<highlight><subscript>c</subscript></highlight>. The shaft/transfer tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> extends into a double acting hydraulic cylinder, generally designated <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having a double acting piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> therein. The piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is connected to a piston rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which extends out of the cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and which is reciprocally mounted on the shaft/transfer tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for movement along the axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The central conduit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the shaft <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> opens through a radial port <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> to a first or fine pitch side <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. At the same time, the concentric conduit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> opens via a port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the opposite or coarse pitch side <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Within hub <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and disposed between the double acting cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the valve assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the piston rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> mounts a conventional reciprocating to rotary motion converting mechanism, generally designated <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. This mechanism may be of any conventional form and as illustrated, includes a pair of bell-shaped plates <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that are abutted near their center and at their point of connection to the piston rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. They are separated to provide a bearing receiving space <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> at their peripheries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A self-aligning spherical bearing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is located in the space <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> for each of a plurality of propeller blades <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> carried by the hub <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The blades <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> have shanks <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which are journaled to the hub <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and retained in the hub <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by a retention bearing system, generally designated <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, of conventional construction. The rotational axis of one blade is shown at <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and it will be observed that the shank <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, at its radially innermost end, includes an eccentrically located pin <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on which the bearing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is mounted. As a consequence, when the piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> moves within the cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the reciprocating to rotary motion converting mechanism <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> reciprocates along the axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and such motion, because of the eccentricity of the pin <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, is converted to rotary motion of the blades <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> within the hub <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, when the piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is moved to the left, the blades <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will be pivoted towards a coarse pitch position. Conversely, when the piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is moved to the right as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the propeller blades <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will be moved toward a fine pitch position and, in a case where reverse thrusting propellers are involved, ultimately toward a reverse thrust position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Finally, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it is to be noted that a reciprocal push rod <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> optionally having a roller <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> thereon is positioned to be engaged by an end <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the piston rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to move reciprocally in a path that is generally parallel to the rotational axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The purpose of this linkage will be described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the backup governing system contained within the valve assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will be described in greater detail. The system includes a spool valve, generally designated <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, having a spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> reciprocally mounted therein. Adjacent one end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, a chamber <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is provided for housing a flyweight assembly, generally designated <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The flyweight assembly <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of flyweights <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> that are generally L-shaped and which include arms <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in operative relation with a radial flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> on the end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. A bearing <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is interposed between the ends of the arms <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and each of the flyweights <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is mounted for pivoting movement about a pivot pin <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. As a consequence of this, as the rotational speed of the hub <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> increases, an increasing amount of centrifugal force will be generated within the flyweight assembly <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which in turn will be conveyed via the arms <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the bearings <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> on the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. This speed dependent force will tend to drive the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the right as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Also within the chamber <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is a spring retainer <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which retains a compression coil spring <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> against the side of the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> opposite the bearings <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. This spring <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> applies a biasing force against the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> that is to the left as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Suitable means (not shown) are provided for varying the position of the retainer <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to pre-set the degree of bias applied by the spring <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Also within the chamber <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is a bell crank <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> mounted for pivotal movement by a pivot pin <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. The bell crank <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, at one end, includes a roller <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> that may be abutted against one of the flyweights <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to move the same. Specifically, the bell crank <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> has sufficient mass to assure this movement of the flyweight <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The contact occurs on the radially inner side of the flyweight <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and is such that the motion of the rod <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> in the decrease pitch direction will cause the flyweight <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, either by the addition of mass or by physical displacement to move radially outward. The effect of such is to drive the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the right as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> and the resulting action in response to a low pitch condition is similar to that caused by an increase in rotational speed. The other end of the bell crank <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> includes a roller <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> engaged with a cam surface, generally designated <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, on an end of the push rod <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The cam surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a valley <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> between two lobes <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It will be observed from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> that when the push rod <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is in the position illustrated, the bell crank <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> will be rotated to a counterclockwise most position with the result that the roller <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> will be at its radially inward most position and out of contact with the flyweight <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that bell crank <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> has enough mass so that it will over power all spring forces in the flyweight system, insuring that it will always be in contact with the cam surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. On the other hand, when allowed to contact the flyweight <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, it will physically position the flyweight <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the push rod <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is moved to the right as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the roller <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> will follow the cam surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> into the cam surface valley <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing the bell crank <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to pivot in a clockwise direction with the result that the roller <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, in contact with the radially inner side of a flyweight <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, will move the flyweight <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> in the counterclockwise direction. Consequently, in the illustrated embodiment, the bell crank <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> serves to position the flyweight assembly <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Specifically, when the bell crank <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is introduced into the flyweight assembly <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, as will occur when a low pitch condition is sensed as will be explained in greater detail hereinafter, the same urges the upper flyweight <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> in a counterclockwise direction about its pivot <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> which allows the lower flyweight <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to rotate in the clockwise direction, thereby moving the flyweight assembly <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> against the flange <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Thus, movement of the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the right will occur as a result. The actuator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, in turn, will reposition the spool to a position where the balance of forces on the actuator will cause equilibrium of the system. In short, when the actuator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is positioned in response to a low pitch condition, it will always position the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> accordingly, thereby guaranteeing direct control of the low pitch stop position and the flyweights <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> have no effect at this time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Still a further biasing force is applied to the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> by a compression coil spring <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> abutted against the end <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> of the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, opposite the end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The spring <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is interposed between the spool end <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and an end <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of a piston valve <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The piston valve <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> has a seal <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> at the end <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and an enlarged end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> also bearing a seal <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>.

A conduit <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> opens the groove <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> to the conduit <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, which eventually communicates with the sump pressure. An internal conduit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is connected to the transfer bearing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) to receive the P<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>stream of hydraulic fluid under pressure.

The conduit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has a second port <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> which opens to the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> between the annuluses <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> in the body of the spool valve <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, depending upon the position of spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. A conduit <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is connected to the annulus <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and extends to a pitch delay valve, generally designated <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>.

It is to be noted that an orifice <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> interconnects the conduits <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in bypass relation to the pitch delay valve <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A conduit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is connected to the annulus <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and extends to an annulus <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> in a reverse enable valve, generally designated <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. The reverse enable valve <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> includes a second annulus <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> that is connected to the sump.

The pitch delay valve includes an internal spool <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> which is biased to the left as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> by a spring <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>.

The groove <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is sized to allow fluid communication between the conduits <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> when the valve <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is in the position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> while the groove <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> is sized to allow fluid communication between the conduit <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> and a conduit <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> that extends to the large side of the stepped bore <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and is in fluid communication with the side of the piston valve <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> opposite the spring <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The land <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> is sized so that when the valve <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> moves to the left from the position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, communication between the conduits <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is cut off and communication between the conduits <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is established, while communication between the conduits <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is also cut off, with the exception of flow through orifice <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Operation is generally as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In normal operation, the components are generally in the position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> will be essentially ineffective with flow to the conduit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> blocked by the land <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, with the conduit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> ported to sump pressure via the groove <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> and the conduit <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>. At the same time, the P<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>stream will be directed to the fine pitch side <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) of the piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> via the conduit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the port <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, past the valve seat <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, to the conduit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and then to the central conduit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> within the shaft/transfer tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the transfer tube <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the P<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>stream will be directed via the conduit <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, the branch <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and the concentric conduit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the coarse pitch side <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Control of the pitch of the propeller will then be effected by the relative pressures P<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>and P<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>in a conventional fashion, i.e., controlled by the electro-hydraulic servo valve, or a hydro-mechanical control valve, in the stationary part of the propeller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the case of an overspeed condition coming into existence, the flyweight <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) will exert an increasing bias against the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> tending to move the same against the spring <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. As that occurs, the groove <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> on the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> begins to meter the P<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>stream entering at the port <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> into the annulus <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> from which it enters the conduit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, passes through the reverse enable valve to the conduit <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, passes through the pitch delay valve <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to the conduit <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> to be applied to the piston valve <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> on the side thereof opposite the spring <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. As a consequence, the piston valve <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> shifts to the right and will close against the seat <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> cutting off the flow of the P<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>from the port <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> to the conduit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The shifting of the piston valve <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> increases the biasing force applied by the spring <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> as well as the counteracting force applied to the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> by the spring <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The spring constant of the springs <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as well as the force supplied by the flyweight <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is chosen so that the balance of forces positions the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> so that as propeller speed reaches 101.5% of maximum speed, the land <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> begins to open the annulus <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to the port <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The resulting movement of the piston valve <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> changes the set point of the system to 103% of maximum speed. It is to be particularly noted that as the spring <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is further compressed, it tends to cause a greater opening to the annulus <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> at the land <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, thus providing positive feedback, which establishes a new set point at 103% of maximum speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, the piston valve <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> will have shifted to the right as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to close against the seat <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. As a consequence, flow from the conduit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to the conduit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> about the seat <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is terminated, and the resetting of the set speed to 103% allows speed to increase to 103% before the governor can control the overspeed. At this speed and time, the shifting of the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the right allows a groove <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> in the spool to come into fluid communication with the annulus <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The groove <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with a conduit <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> extending to the sump. Thus, the conduit <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is gradually connected to the sump via the groove <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>. The conduit <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> remains connected to the central conduit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in the shaft/transfer tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> leading to the fine pitch side <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) of the double acting piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Hydraulic fluid on that side of the piston is then permitted to flow to the sump out of the center conduit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, through the conduit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to the conduit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and either through the orifice <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> or the groove <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> in the pitch delay valve <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> to the conduit <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. Thus, pressure is relieved in the double acting cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> allowing the rotational and aerodynamic force existing in the propeller assembly and the P<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>pressure signal to urge the piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the left as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> thereby increasing the propeller pitch in the coarse direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> As a consequence, propeller speed will begin to diminish as the pitch increases resulting in the flyweight <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> applying a lesser biasing force to the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which tends to allow the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to shift to the left until the new equilibrium point is established by the movement of the piston valve <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is reached. At this time, the land <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> will be modulating flow to or from the fine pitch side <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the sump or from groove <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> at the annulus <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Essentially, the main control system has been locked out by shifting of the piston valve <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> until propeller speed decreases to 100% of maximum speed, at which time the flyweight <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> allows the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to return to its normal-operating position. If one or the other of the main controls is operating properly, propeller pitch to prevent overspeed is maintained by it. If not, as speed increases, the backup system again cycles into backup operation as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In a low pitch condition, the same sort of action occurs. However, in this particular case, it is initiated by the push rod <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> being engaged by the end <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the piston rod <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to cause the cam <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to cause the bell crank <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> to physically position the flyweight assembly <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the spool <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> now becomes a motion control valve rather than a force control valve and pitch is increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> When it is desired to reverse pitch, a manual control is shifted to the conventional ground stop position. This in turn energizes a solenoid valve (not shown) which allows the stream P<highlight><subscript>gds </subscript></highlight>signal to be applied to the right-hand side of the reverse enable valve <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. The resulting shift of the spool <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> causes the groove <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> to establish fluid communication between the line <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> and the sump while cutting off flow from the annulus <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. As a consequence, the piston <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, if not already in the position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, will be shifted back to that position primarily by the balance of pressure forces on piston <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and secondarily by the bias of the spring <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. At the same time, the flow path to the conduit <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> is cut off within the reverse enable valve <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> to again prevent the piston valve <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> to be shifted to the right. Consequently, the backup governing system is disabled, allowing the propeller to be operated below flight idle or even in the reverse thrust position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In some instances, during aircraft maneuvers that could result in so-called negative G&apos;s coming into effect, oil pressure may be temporarily lost. In such a situation, it is not desirable that a rapid pitch change in the propeller occur during normal operation. In such a situation, the pressures of streams P<highlight><subscript>f </subscript></highlight>and P<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>may momentarily drop. When P<highlight><subscript>c </subscript></highlight>drops in pressure, it allows the spring <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> to move the spool <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> of the pitch delay valve to the left as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> This not only cuts off communication between the conduits <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, but it also connects conduit <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and conduit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and cuts off communication between the conduits <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> through the pitch delay valve <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and allowing communication between those conduits only through the orifice <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. It is to be noted that where the propeller is counterweighted, as is frequently the case, the blades will naturally tend toward coarse pitch under the influence of rotational and aerodynamic forces. This causes the cavity on the side <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to be pressurized as the piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> moves toward coarser pitch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> With the conduits <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> connected by the spool <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, continued flow from the fine pitch side <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is directed against the piston <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, shifting it to the right as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to seat against the valve seat <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Only at this time does the flow from the fine pitch side <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> pass through the orifice <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, which now acts as a flow limiter, limiting the flow back to the conventional electro hydraulic servo valve (not shown) in the main control to a limited flow rate so that a rapid pitch change will not be effected. There will be, however, an initial flow rate greater than such limited flow rate until the piston <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> closes against the valve seat <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it will be appreciated that a backup governing system made according to the invention provides excellent control of the propeller during situations such as overspeed for low pitch and governs the propeller at 103%&plus;/&minus;3% of maximum speed. The same eliminates mechanical components at the interface between the fixed and rotating propeller system parts and yet is completely compatible with conventional systems to the point where it may be readily retrofitted therewith. </paragraph>
