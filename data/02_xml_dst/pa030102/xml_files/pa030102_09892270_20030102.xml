<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to the treatment of stormwater and similar surface runoff. More particularly, the present invention relates to the removal of floatable and non-floatable matter there from so that cleaner water is returned to the environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Eighty percent of the pollution to the North American fresh water resource has been attributed to stormwater runoff. Sediments, contaminated by hydrocarbons and their floating residuals, flow freely from paved impervious sites into storm water collection systems. Mitigated wetlands and storm water ponds are historically accepted as the method of controlling storm water quality. While ponds and wetlands are, on one hand, an effective treatment for non-point source discharges, they nevertheless undesirably occupy valuable commercial property and create an open water liability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Oil and grit separators have been used to control hydrocarbon loadings. Such a separator comprises a concrete structure linked to the storm drain system with two pools used to trap oil and grit. Such a separator is illustrated in &ldquo;Hydrocarbon Hotspots in the Urban Landscape: Can they be Controlled&quest;&rdquo; <highlight><italic>Watershed Protection Techniques</italic></highlight>, Vol. 1, No. 1, February, 1994. This article states that recent research indicates that such oil and grit separators are not effective in trapping pollutants. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,759,415 describes a storm water treatment system which has a tangential inlet to a circular grit chamber wherein a swirling motion is produced to direct settleable solids toward the center and to reduce resuspension in the grit chamber. The water is released from the grit chamber into an oil chamber defined between the grit chamber and a barrier wall, which has an outlet that is located at the bottom thereof to thereby provide a baffle that traps floatables in the oil chamber. The barrier wall also has an upper overflow outlet. These outlets direct the water into a flow control chamber that has a lower outlet higher than the lower outlet from the oil chamber and has upper overflow outlet. These flow control chamber outlets, which are provided with weirs for flow control, direct the water into an outlet chamber from which the treated water is removed through a lower outlet pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the &apos;415 patent, the grit chamber outlet is in the wall thereof. Thus, water swirling along the side of the circular grit chamber wall is passed through this outlet. Suspended particulate matter may not have been adequately removed from this water by the time it passes into the outlet that is also inefficiently large in size. It is therefore considered desirable to more efficiently remove particulate matter from the water before it is passed into the oil chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a more efficient storm water treatment system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is also an object of the present invention to provide such a system which is inexpensive, easy to operate, and reliable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In order to provide such a system, in accordance with the present invention, runoff water is passed tangentially into a primary chamber wherein non-floatable matter is removed by swirling action of the water, then through an outlet for passage into a secondary chamber for removal of oil and other floatable matter therefrom, the outlet being located centrally of the primary chamber to remove water from which greater amounts of non-floatable matter has been removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The outlet from the primary chamber is preferably provided by a conduit that extends into the primary chamber with its end portion, which provides the outlet, disposed vertically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The above and other objects, feature, and advantages of the present invention will be apparent in the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment thereof when read in conjunction with the appended drawings wherein the same reference numerals denote the same or similar parts throughout the several views.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, there is illustrated generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> an apparatus for treating water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, such as stormwater or other surface runoff such as, for example, from industrial, commercial, and urban applications. The water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is treated by removing non-floatable matter such as sand, hydrocarbon-laden sediment, debris, silt, and heavy metals, illustrated at <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and floatable matter such as oil and other petroleum-based liquids, illustrated at <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, therefrom. The contaminated water is received through inlet pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as illustrated at <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and the treated water is discharged through outlet pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for return to the environment, as illustrated at <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, or as otherwise desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a primary chamber, illustrated at <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, for removing sediment and other non-floatables <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the water, a secondary chamber, illustrated at <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, for removing oil and other floatables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the water, and a tertiary effluent chamber, illustrated at <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The water <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> initially enters the primary chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by flowing through inlet pipe or conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and is discharged from the tertiary chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> although outlet conduit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The inlet conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> typically would be an existing conduit sized for the flow rate to be handled, and the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> typically would be constructed at the site for connection of the conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The primary chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be contained within a housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which has a circular wall <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a floor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and a ceiling <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> suitably joined together and composed of suitable material such as, for example, high strength steel-reinforced corrosion-resistant precast concrete suitable for heavy truck traffic loading. The floor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is desirably a monolithic base section for desirably providing anti-floatation of the housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may, for example, be on the order of about 6 to 10 feet high and about 6 to 10 feet in inside diameter depending on the flow rate, on the order of about 3 to 26 or higher cubic feet per minute, the apparatus is to be capable of handling. The pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is suitably sealingly secured in an opening in the wall <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as well as other conduits described in this specification, which may be composed of steel, plastic, or other suitable material, may be suitably sealingly secured in openings in their respective walls by means of grout, illustrated at <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, or other suitable means. The secondary and tertiary chambers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> respectively may be contained within a similarly shaped and sized housing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and which is shown to have a circular wall <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a floor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and a ceiling <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> nad <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be contained in separate housings. Housing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be otherwise suitably shaped, such as, for example, rectangular in a horizontal plane. Outlet pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is suitably sealingly secured within an opening in the wall <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of housing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Inlet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and outlet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are located at about the same height intermediate the heights of the housings <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> respectively, for example, at or slightly below mid-height. Outlet pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> exits radially of housing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, i.e., in a direction along a direction in which a diameter of the housing extends. The outlet pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is sized to handle the flow rate and thus would typically have a diameter equal approximately to the diameter of inlet pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> When, during a storm event, the water flow through pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is near the capacity of pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (flow rate for which pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is sized), the water is flowed into the chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at high velocity to achieve a long path length for the solids during travel through the first chamber which allows the non-floatable solids <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to desirably be deposited out or dropped to the bottom of the chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and thereby become separated from the water. The storm event creates the energy to achieve the desired velocity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> If desired, a suitable check valve may be installed on pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to prevent back-flow as well as to provide a nozzle effect by opening only under a head pressure thereby providing the desired velocity when there is flow into the chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A suitable check valve for this purpose is a Tideflex&trade; valve marketed by Red Valve Company, Inc. of Pittsburgh, Pa. Such a valve may be especially desirable in tidal areas to prevent back-flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is disposed, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, to be tangential to the primary chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, i.e., it extends in a direction, in a horizontal plane, generally of a direction in which a tangent to the chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the horizontal plane extends The high velocity water is thus introduced into the primary chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> tangentially in order to effect a circular or swirling motion, illustrated at <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, to the water about the vertical axis <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to form a void or vacuum or vortex and thereby drawing toward and into the vortex bodies subject to its action, i.e., drawing suspended particles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the water into the vortex and dropping them onto the bottom of the chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. This vortex action is provided to also keep the non-floatable particles <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the chamber bottom so that they don&apos;t become re-entrained or resuspended in the water. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The water with the non-floatable matter <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> removed is then removed from the primary chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for passage into the secondary chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through an outlet <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. If the outlet was located in the circular chamber wall <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as in the aforesaid Vortechnics apparatus, the water may not be as devoid of non-floatable matter as water nearer the vortex. Water is preferably removed near the vortex where it is more devoid of non-floatable matter. This allows a higher quality of partially treated water to be delivered to the secondary chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for more efficient water treatment. In accordance with the present invention, one section of a pipe or other suitable conduit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>A is received and suitably sealingly secured in adjacent openings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> in the walls of primary and secondary chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> respectively disposed a spaced distance, for example 12&Prime; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, from the bottom surfaces of the chambers thereof for delivery of the water to the secondary chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The other end portion of the pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> is positioned to extend vertically at the center <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the primary chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and terminates slightly above the height of pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at the inlet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to provide the opening <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to serve as an inlet for the water at the center <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is positioned at the center of the chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so that they are at the center of the vortex, the rotating motion of the water and the resulting low pressure at the vortex causes entrained particles to fall downwardly into a stable pile so that the water, but not the diverted particles, enters the intake at that location. Thus, the pipe extends horizontally from the secondary chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into the center of the primary chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> then bends 90 degrees to extend vertically to its terminal end. The pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> may be supported above the floor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by a section of pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>C. The floor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> provides a surface on which the non-floatable material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is received. The pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> extends vertically upward above the height of the inlet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The entrance to the pipe may be shaped like an inverted truncated cone. Located in the center of the opening <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be an anti-vortex device <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight>. The anti-vortex device may be made of a suitable material such as a plastic or metal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An anti-retrainment plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is shown installed below the inlet of conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (for example, about 6 to 12 inches below the inlet). Such a shelf is considered to be optional. Without wishing to be bound by theory here or elsewhere in this specification, it is believed that such a plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be desirable to accelerate the settling of the solids <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and provide some separation between the settled solids and the swirling water flow <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> whereby the space below the plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be relatively less turbulent so that the solids may more efficiently be kept separated. The anti re-entrainment plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> creates a flow gradient and pressure differential within swirling water flow <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This pressure differential allows sediment to fall below the plate and to be trapped thus preventing re-entrainment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The anti-retrainment plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is a plate that extends horizontally and may be supported by the wall <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The plate has a centrally located opening <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, preferably circular, for allowing non-floatables <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to settle to the bottom of the primary chamber <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> has a diameter that is substantially greater than that of the conduit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> (for example, about twice the diameter of conduit <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>) to provide an area underneath the vortex for the particles of sediment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to drop through. The plate may optionally have a plurality of openings or cutouts, illustrated at <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, spaced circumferentially about the plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to allow a continuity of the swirling motion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> below and above the plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. For example, the plate <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, which may have a thickness of about &frac34; inch and may be composed of a similar material as an anti-vortex device <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> is composed, may have a plurality (four shown) of openings <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>A equally spaced circumferentially about the plate and each of which may be square in shape, have a length and width each of approximately one tenth of the diameter of chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and be positioned approximately midway of a radius of chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Other opening shapes are also contemplated including circles, triangles, rectangles, and quadrilaterals as well as different quantities of opening, and arrangement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A plurality of vortex breakers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> with a sediment distribution notch may be circumferentially located about the floor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the first chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The vortex breakers can be used to break the vortex flow and slow the flow and encourage suspended sediment to be deposited in chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> located in the pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> provides for a coriolus intake of stormwater at low flow rates such as during lighter storms. The stormwater enters the first chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through the inlet <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and exits the first chamber through the vertical pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and travels to the second chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment shown, the opening is approximately 2&Prime; in diameter and is located at or below the level of the inlet pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The size of the opening may depend on the capacity of stormwater to be treated. A second opening <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be provided above the openings <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> by a small distance of, for example, about 6 inches in order to handle, in conjunction with openings <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, an increased flow rate. This also allows the openings <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to be sized desirably small for increased efficiency of sediment removal, i.e., the sediment does not as easily enter the openings <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> when they are smaller. The single openings <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may be replaced by a plurality of openings circumferentially disposed about the periphery of the pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. For example, each opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> may comprise about 6 openings equally spaced circumferentially and each having a diameter of about 1 inch. A suitable baffle may be provided over each of the openings <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to deflect particles, which have not already fallen, away from the openings <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> so that good efficiency of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be maintained. Thus, the coriolis intake is provided to allow the stormwater above the separated solids to pass virtually sediment-free to the next treatment phase in secondary chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> An overflow pipe or other suitable conduit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> extends between the primary and tertiary chambers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> respectively near the ceilings thereof, and is suitably sealingly attached in openings <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> in the walls thereof, for dumping some of the treated (due to the swirling action <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) water into the tertiary chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> if the flow rate into the primary chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> exceeds its capacity to handle it. The overflow pipe <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> extends radially, i.e., in a direction along which a diameter of the housing extends, into the first chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> approximately half way to the axis <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. A first end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>A of the pipe <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is cut at an angle to the vertical axis. The pipe provides an anti-vortex effect at high flows. Details of the angle are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The angle may face towards or away from the inlet pipe <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The angle is shown at 30&deg;, although other angles are contemplated, preferably ranging from about 10&deg; to about 80&deg;. The second end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>B of the pipe <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> extend through an opening <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in a barrier wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that separate the second and the third chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Oil and other floatable material <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is separated from the water in the secondary chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, i.e., means are provided for preventing the floatable material from entering the tertiary effluent chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The secondary chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is provided to be relatively quiescent, suitable for allowing oil and other floatable matter to float to the top without disruptedly mixing back into the water whereby such separation may efficiently occur. In order to prevent oil from entering the tertiary chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the barrier wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> extends upwardly from the floor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and stops just below the ceiling <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, leaving a gap <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. Two openings <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>B are formed along the lower edge of the wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the sidewall <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The openings <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>B are offset from the longitudinal axis of the pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>A. The top edges of the openings <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>B are lower than the exit of the horizontal pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>A. Stormwater exiting pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>A enters the second chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The stormwater exits the second chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> through the openings <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>B and enters the third chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The stormwater follows a flow path, illustrated at <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Since water entering chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> comes from the bottom of the body of water in chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and since oil and other floatables rise to and float on top of the water, the flow path <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is accordingly provided so that they do not enter the third chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In order to prevent oil-laden water exiting pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>A from passing directly into pathway <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> so that good separation efficiency of the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is maintained, an upper portion of the pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>A is removed leaving only a lower portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> at the end <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>B of pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>A. The lower portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>A is secured in the barrier wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The stormwater travels along the pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>A and is redirected by the barrier wall <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> so that the floatables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> have time to rise after the water passes out of the pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>A. The gap <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> may allow storm water to pass in the event of a high flow rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The passage of the stormwater, with non-floatables <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> removed in the primary chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and with floatables <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> removed in the secondary chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> enters the tertiary effluent chamber <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for its removal through pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the environment in an environmentally desirable cleansed state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Thus, the trapped floating contaminants <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in secondary chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are raised with the water level therein, which is kept at that level or higher by the height of exit pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so that the floatable contaminants, created by the storm event and subsequent storm events, are not washed out through the pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The stormwater level in secondary chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is normally maintained during quiescent periods at the height of the exit pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> An opening, illustrated at <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, is contained in the ceiling <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for venting as well as to allow access to primary chamber <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> for removing the sediment <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> therefrom and otherwise maintaining it. Similarly, a vent opening, illustrated at <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, is contained in the ceiling <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and which allows access to chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for skimming the oil <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> from the surface of the water and removal thereof and otherwise for maintenance. Opening <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which may have a diameter of, for example, about 24 inches, is suitably positioned so that it is not directly over the outlet provided by pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> Opening <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be similarly sized. To each of these openings is suitably installed, in known manner, a hatch <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> with a suitable vented cover <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, each of cast iron, steel, plastic, or other material. In order to allow for elevation change, i.e., so that the vent outlets are desirably above grade, riser rings <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are provided between the respective ceiling and the cover <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, and the riser rings are suitably sealed to each other and to the ceiling and the cover by, e.g., butyl joint material, illustrated at <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, or other suitable means. The number of riser rings <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> (three shown for each hatch) will vary depending on elevation. The hatch for the primary chamber is illustrated with the riser rings apart for ease of illustration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> If desired, additional equipment may optionally be added to the apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for improving the separation efficiency thereof. For example, the secondary chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may be provided with an ECOSEP&trade; oil-water separator, marketed by env21&trade; of East Pembroke, N.Y., or other suitable high efficiency separator (with internal storage containment) for additional treatment (during non-storm events) to purify down to perhaps about 5 parts per million of non-emulsified free oil. For another example, a suitable coalescing filter structure, conventionally known in the art, may be attached to the outlet of the pipe <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>A in the secondary chamber <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to coalesce floatable particles into clumps thereof so that they more efficiently rise to the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Thus, in accordance with the present invention, the outlet from the primary chamber is provided at the location of the vortex in order to receive water with a maximum of non-floatable particles removed therefrom so that the contaminant removal efficiency may be maximized, to achieve a removal rate efficiency of perhaps about 80 percent for a typical bimonthly rainfall activity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that, while the present invention has been described in detail herein, the invention can be embodied otherwise without departing from the principles thereof, and such other embodiments are meant to come within the scope of the present invention as defined in the following claim(s) </paragraph>
