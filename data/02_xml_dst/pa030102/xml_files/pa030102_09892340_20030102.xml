<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a prosthetic mesh system and, more particularly, to a prosthetic mesh system adapted for implantation in a body. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the past, surgical mesh layers have been used as underlay patches for repairing hernia defects (e.g., openings or holes formed in a wall of an organ, through which interior organs tend to protrude). For instance, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,254,133 and 5,725,577 disclose patch-type prostheses placed in hernia defects to close off associated openings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A typical underlay patch includes a generally flat mesh cut into a certain geometric (e.g., circular, oval, etc.) shape. After being inserted through a hernia defect in a folded or collapsed condition, the underlay patch is expanded into its flat condition so as to cover an opening formed in the hernia defect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Various mechanism have been proposed for facilitating the intraoperative expansion of surgical meshes to their flat shape or condition. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,254,133 discloses a surgical implantation device having resilient or shape memory segments attached thereto, while U.S. Pat. No. 5,368,602 discloses a patch of flexible surgical mesh material equipped with an elongated semi-rigid member attached thereto. In addition, European Patent Publication No. 0 544 485 B1 discloses a tissue aperture repair device having spokes or a stiffener member (see also U.S. Pat. No. 5,258,000), while U.S. Pat. No. 5,141,515 discloses an implanting device for use with patches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Although the devices discussed above can be used intraoperatively to expand surgical meshes to their flat shape, they suffer from various problems. For instance, additional members or mechanisms separate from meshes are used in these devices, potentially increasing their production costs. Moreover, because of such additional members or mechanisms, the production and/or use of the devices are made complicated. In addition, the presence of an expansion member with stiffness greater than the surgical mesh results in less adaptability to the anatomy surrounding the hernia defect. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the disadvantages and shortcomings of the prior art discussed above by providing a new and improved prosthetic mesh system adapted for implantation in a body. More particularly, the mesh system includes a biocompatible mesh layer. The mesh layer is flexible such that the mesh layer has a generally flat shape when it is in a first (i.e., expanded) condition and a generally collapsed shape when it is in a second (i.e., folded or compressed) condition. The mesh layer has at least one ridge formed integrally therewith and projecting therefrom in a direction substantially perpendicular to the mesh layer when the mesh layer is in the first condition. The ridge is sized and shaped so as to facilitate the movement of the mesh layer from its collapsed shape to its flat shape. In accordance with one feature of the present invention, the mesh system is adapted for use as a patch for repairing a hernia defect.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a surgical mesh system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention. More particularly, the surgical mesh system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a pair of patches (i.e., layers) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a connecting member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> connecting the patches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to one another. The patches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are sized and shaped so as to be positioned on opposing sides of an opening of a hernia defect <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) in a conventional manner. The patches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the connecting member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are made preferably from a polypropylene mesh, such as the meshes marketed by Johnson &amp; Johnson under the trademark &ldquo;PROLENE&rdquo;. Alternatively, other biocompatible materials, such as polytetraflouroethylene, can be used for the surgical mesh system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the patches <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are flexible such that they have a generally flat (i.e., planar) shape when they are in an expanded condition and a generally collapsed shape when they are in a compressed or folded condition. In this manner, the surgical mesh system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be delivered to the hernia defect <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in its collapsed shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the patch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shaped so as to form therein a pair of concentric rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> located adjacent to the circumference <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the patch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. More particularly, each of the rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in the form of a ridge and is part of the patch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (i.e., is integral with the patch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). In other words, each of the rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> projects from the patch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a direction substantially perpendicular to the patch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and hence is non-coplanar relative to same (i.e., the rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> have a raised three-dimensional geometrical shape, while the rest of the patch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is substantially flat) Although the rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are preferably formed by a conventional thermo-forming process used in shaping surgical meshes, other processes can be used for shaping the patch so as to provide the rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that the rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> facilitate the expansion or movement of the patch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> from its collapsed condition to its extended or flat condition intraoperatively. Without limiting the scope of the present invention, it is believed that when the patch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is bent out of its flat or planar shape, the three-dimensional geometrical shape of the rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> undergoes deformation, creating reactive force upon the entire patch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The reactive force causes the patch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to resume or return to its flat shape during intraoperative placement. As a result, the patch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is adapted to expand from its collapsed shape to its flat shape without the use of a separate or external member or without changing (i.e., increasing) the stiffness or rigidity of the basic mesh material of the patch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the patch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> maintains flexibility such that it can conform to anatomical structures adjacent to the hernia defect <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> without having certain portions with rigidity greater than the rest of the patch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the surgical mesh system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can have numerous modifications and variations. For instance, the patch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be provided with rings similar to the rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be modified to have different geometric shape or orientation. By way of example, the patch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be provided with ridges extending parallel to one another in a linear direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> illustrate a surgical mesh system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. More particularly, the surgical mesh system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a construction identical to that of the surgical mesh system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, except as follows. The surgical mesh system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a patch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> provided with a plurality of ridges <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> extending radially outwardly from a center <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the patch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Each of the ridges <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has an end <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, which is located adjacent to the center <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and an end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which is located remote from the center <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The ends <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of the ridges <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are provided with a height greater than the height at the ends <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the ridges <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). Moreover, the ridges <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> taper as they extend from the ends <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to the ends <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Like the rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the surgical mesh system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the ridges <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> facilitate the patch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to expand or move from its folded or collapsed condition to its flat condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the surgical mesh system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can have numerous modifications and variations. For instance, one or both of the rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be formed in the patch <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> together with the ridges <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> illustrate a surgical mesh layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. More particularly, the surgical mesh layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is constructed as a single sheet and has a plurality of projecting ridges <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extending linearly between opposing ends <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the surgical mesh layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, other geometrical patterns or shapes (e.g., crisscrossing patterns) can be used for the ridges <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The ridges <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> perform the same basic function as the rings <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and ridges <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the surgical mesh systems <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, respectively. While the surgical mesh layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is particularly suitable for use as a patch for repairing hernia defects, it can be used for other medical applications (e.g., pelvic floor reconstruction, mesh tamponading of organs, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Two samples of the surgical mesh layer <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (i.e., Samples A and B having ridges extending in wale and course directions, respectively) were tested using a cantilever test method for the purpose of measuring their flexural rigidity. A sample of a surgical mesh layer without ridges (i.e., Sample C) was also tested as control. According to this experiment, the flexural rigidity of Sample A was about 6781 mg*cm, while the flexural rigidity of Sample B was about 7335 mg*cm. The flexural rigidity of Sample C (control) was measured to be about 624 mg*cm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the embodiments described herein are merely exemplary and that a person skilled in the art may make many variations and modifications, including those discussed above, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. All such variations and modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
