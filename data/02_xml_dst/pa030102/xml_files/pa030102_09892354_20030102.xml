<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A handle comprises a main body, a control member, and a light emitting member. The control member and the light-emitting member are disposed in a receiving space of the main body. As the control member is pressed with finger, the light-emitting member emits light. The cessation of light emission by the light-emitting member is brought about by freeing the control member from the pressure exerting thereon. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a handle with a means to emit light for enhancing the versatility of the handle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In keeping with the principle of the present invention, the foregoing objective of the present invention is attained by a handle comprising a main body, a light-emitting member disposed in the interior of the main body, and a control member disposed in the main body such that the control member is in contact with the light-emitting member at such time when the control member is exerted on by an external force. The light-emitting member is capable of emitting light at the time when the control member is pressed with finger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The features and the functions of the present invention will be more readily understood upon a thoughtful deliberation of the following detailed description of the present invention with reference to the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a handle embodied in the present invention comprises a main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a control member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and a light-emitting member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is of a rod-shaped construction and is made of a transparent or translucent material. The main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided in the interior with a receiving space to accommodate the control member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the light-emitting member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The control member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is formed of a press button and a spring. The control member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is disposed in the receiving space of the main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such that the press button is partially jutted out of the longitudinal upper surface of the main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The light-emitting member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is disposed in the receiving space of the main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> such that the light-emitting member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is located under the control member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The light-emitting member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed of a battery <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, one or more light-emitting bodies <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and a circuit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in communication with the battery <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the light-emitting bodies <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Under the circumstance that the control member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is not exerted on by an external force, the light-emitting bodies <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the light-emitting member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are disconnected with the battery <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. As soon as the control member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is exerted on by the external force, the light-emitting bodies <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are connected with the battery <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, thereby resulting in emission of light by the light-emitting bodies <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When the control member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is relieved of the external force exerting thereon, the light-emitting bodies <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> become disconnected with the battery <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, thereby resulting in cessation of emission of light by the light-emitting bodies <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The main body <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided with one or more decorative pieces <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to give the handle of the present invention and added esthetic effect. The decorative pieces <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are various in color and form, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The esthetic effect of the handle of the present invention is greatly enhanced by the refraction of light emitted by the light-emitting bodies <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The present invention described above is to be regarded in all respects as being merely illustrative and not restrictive. Accordingly, the present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without deviating from the spirit thereof. The present invention is therefore to be limited only by the scopes of the following appended claims. </paragraph>

<claim-text><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A handle comprising: 
<claim-text>a main body made of a transparent or translucent material and provided in an interior with a receiving space; </claim-text>
<claim-text>a control member formed of a press button and a spring, said control member being disposed in said receiving space of said main body such that said press button is partially jutted out of an upper surface of said main body; and </claim-text>
<claim-text>a light-emitting member formed of a battery, one or more light-emitting bodies, and a circuit in communication with said battery and said light-emitting bodies, said light-emitting member being disposed in said receiving space of said main body such that said light-emitting member is located under said control member, and that said battery is connected with said light-emitting bodies at such time when said control member is forced by an external force to make contact with said light-emitting member, thereby resulting in emission of light by said light-emitting bodies whereby said light-emitting bodies become disconnected with said battery at such time when said control member is relieved of the external force, thereby resulting in cessation of emission of light by said light-emitting bodies. </claim-text>
