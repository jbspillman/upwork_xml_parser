<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention generally relates to content addressable memories and more particularly to an improved content addressable memory that includes comparator features which decrease precharging activities and, therefore, reduce power consumption. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The purpose of a content addressable memory (CAM) is to conduct a large number of searches as quickly as possible. Power dissipation is typically high as speed is the primary design goal. A typical CAM uses dynamic logic to precharge a matchline to the default condition (a match), and conditionally discharge this matchline (to the mismatch condition). After the search operation is completed, the result is detected, and the matchline is precharged to the default match condition. The only time the matchline does not consume precharge power is when it is not discharged between searches (e.g., when there is a match). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is mathematically trivial to prove that a random bit will match half of the time and mismatch half of the time. Matching 100% of the bits, therefore, becomes decreasingly uncommon as the number of bits increases. For example, the chance of a matching word becomes 0.5<highlight><superscript>n </superscript></highlight>(where n is the number of bits in the word searched) and n is typically much greater than 8, typically between 32 and 288. Since the only time the matchline saves power is when it is not discharged between searches, it is desirable to decrease the number of times that it is discharged. With 8 bits, 0.5<highlight><superscript>n </superscript></highlight>is 0.0039. Thus, such a conventional 8-bit word CAM dissipates all precharged power greater than 99.5% of the time, with random data. While it is important to prevent the meaningless waste of power, slowing CAM and other memory components is much less acceptable. Therefore, there is a need to conserve power in CAMs without sacrificing speed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a structure and method for improving a content addressable memory array having a plurality of serially connected memory sub-arrays (which include at least one memory cell), a matchline connected to each of the sub-arrays, a valid memory cell, a comparator which receives input from the matchline and valid memory cell, a sinkline output from the comparator, and a precharge device. The sinkline and matchline are reset from a first voltage to a second voltage depending upon the results of a compare operation of the input data to the data in the storage device. When the second voltage appears on the matchline and the first voltage appears on the sinkline this indicates a match between the data within all of the sub-arrays and the input data. If the second voltage appears on the sinkline this indicates a mismatch between data within any of the sub-arrays and the input data, or an invalid status within the valid memory cell and maintains the sinkline at the second voltage. If the first of the sub-arrays has data different than the input data, this maintains the sinkline at the second voltage. Further, the matchline is maintained at the second voltage while the sinkline is at the second voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Within each of the sub-arrays, the memory cells are connected serially and include a dynamic transistor for communicating with adjacent memory cells. The invention may also include sense amplifiers, each connected to a different sub-array, wherein the sense amplifiers include a single inverter. Further, if the first of the sub-arrays has data matching the input data, this drops the sinkline to the first voltage. In addition, if the sinkline is at the first voltage and a second of the sub-arrays has data different than the input data, the sinkline is connected to the matchline and drops the matchline to the first voltage. In the alternative condition, if the sinkline is at the first voltage and a second of the sub-arrays has data matching, then the matchline maintains the second voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the invention indicates a non-matching memory cell array without discharging the matchline. Instead, the high voltage on the sinkline indicates a non-matching condition. As discussed in greater detail below, only a limited number of circumstances allow the matchline to discharge when indicating a non-match condition. Therefore, by reducing the instances when the matchline will discharge, the invention eliminates the need to precharge the matchline as often and therefore consumes less power than conventional content addressable memory devices that precharge the match line more than 99% of the time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The invention reduces the number of times the matchline must be precharged by reducing the situations in which the matchline may discharge. Matchline power consumption goes up as the number of bits in a word increase. Match bitline power consumption goes up as the number of words in the array goes up. Therefore, the invention can produce even greater power savings as the sizes of the arrays and sizes of the words increase. Power is also saved by only comparing data words that have been marked as &ldquo;valid&rdquo; within the scope of the application. In the event that a word is marked invalid, only the first two sub-arrays compare, leaving the presumably largest subset of the data to save power.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, content addressable memories have a large power requirement because the matchline must be precharged before almost every search of the memory array. The invention reduces the number of times the matchline must be precharged by reducing the situations in which the matchline may discharge. More specifically, the invention includes a valid signal and sinkline that prevent the matchline from discharging under specific circumstances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> content addressable memory cell is illustrated. The upper part of the memory cell is the actual storage element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> itself and the lower part of the memory cell is a conventional comparator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also illustrates the conventional wordline, the matching bitline true (MBLT), matching bitline complement (MBLC), bitline true (BLT), and bitline complement (BLC). The internal features of the storage elements/comparators are well known to those ordinarily skilled in the art and not discussed here so as not to unnecessarily obscure the salient features of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Conventional content addressable memory cells also include a matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, conventional content addressable memory arrays precharge the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> before comparison data is sent to the comparator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If the input data matches the data within the storage element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> remains at the higher voltage precharge level. On the other hand, if the data within the storage element <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> does not match the data input, the comparator <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> lowers the voltage of the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Since the data in the storage entry will match the inquiry data only a small number of times, the conventional content addressable memory architecture precharges and discharges almost every matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> within the array each time a data inquiry is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In general terms, the inventive content addressable memory array includes serially connected memory sub-arrays. There is a matchline connected to each of said sub-arrays and a comparator having inputs connected to the matchline and the valid memory bit(s). The sinkline is output from the comparator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An initial test is performed by testing a first sub-array to determine if a second sub-array contains valid data and a search is performed to determine whether a portion of the word searched matches any portion of a word stored in the second sub-array. This test, if successful, results in the valid signal for the first sub-array and the matchline signal for the second sub-array both transitioning to a low voltage. These voltages being low as input to an OR gate comparator, drive the sinkline voltage low, which indicates the match condition in the first and second sub-arrays. An invalid status within the valid memory bit maintains the sinkline at the precharge voltage. Also, if the first of the series of said sub-arrays has data different than the input data, the sinkline is maintained at a high voltage level. Further, when the sinkline has a high voltage, there is no discharge path for the matchline, so the matchline remains high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the invention indicates a non-matching condition in at least one of two tested CAM sub-arrays without discharging the matchline. Instead, the high voltage on the sinkline indicates a non-matching condition. As discussed in greater detail below, only a limited number of circumstances allow the matchline to discharge when indicating a non-match condition. Therefore, by reducing the instances when the matchline will discharge, the invention eliminates the need to precharge the matchline as often and therefore consumes less power than conventional content addressable memory devices that precharge the match line more than 99% of the time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As discussed in greater detail below, the inventive content addressable memory cell includes a sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that is utilized to reduce the number of times the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> needs to be precharged, thereby saving power. The operation of the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will be explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which illustrates a first CAM cell array <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a second CAM cell array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, a first sense amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a third CAM cell array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and a second sense amplifier <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The first CAM cell array <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a special cell (or cells) that includes information as to whether the data within all the cells of an array is valid data (e.g., validity cells). The second and third arrays <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are sub-arrays of the overall larger content addressable memory array and actually maintain the data stored by the array. For example, sub-array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is similar to the cell shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Data is arranged such that the second and third sub-arrays <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> each contain a portion of each searchable word, for example, each sub-array contains a four-bit portion of an eight-bit word. While only two sub-arrays <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, as would be known by one ordinarily skilled in the art given this disclosure, many more sub-arrays can be utilized with content addressable memories. The sub-arrays <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are arranged serially and the data held within the arrays is examined sequentially. Therefore, the data within the second sub-array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is checked before the data within the third sub-array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are initially set to before the comparison data is input into the circuit. If the data within the second sub-array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> does not match the data input as the query into the array, the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> remains at a high voltage level. The subsequent serial sub-array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> will recognize this high voltage level on the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and will not perform a comparison of the data contained within the third sub-array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. To the contrary, if the second sub-array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> data matches the inquiry data, the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is discharged to a zero or low voltage level. The third sub-array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, upon sensing the low sinkline 16 voltage level will perform a data comparison of the input data to the data stored within the third sub-array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. If the data also matches the third sub-array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the third sub-array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> remains at a high voltage level, thereby indicating a data match. However, if the data within the third sub-array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> does not match the query data input into the overall array, the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is also discharged, indicating a non-match condition. Therefore, a non-match condition is indicated by a high sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or by a low matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The only signal condition which would indicate a proper data match is a low sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a high matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, whenever the second sub-array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> does not have data matching the inquiry data, a high sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is presented to the third sub-array which prevents the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the third sub-array from being discharged. In such a situation, the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the third sub-array and sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in the third array are not discharged. Since these lines are not discharged, they do not need to be precharged before the next data comparison is performed. By eliminating the number of situations where the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> needs to be precharged, substantial power savings are achieved with the use of the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, CAMs typically have &ldquo;valid&rdquo;bits <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> set aside which are used to remove an entire word (e.g., a group of sub-arrays) from the searchable state. Those skilled in the art are familiar with how valid bits are used; the term &ldquo;valid bit&rdquo; refers to a status bit, of which there can be more than one, which can indicate age, validity, or a number of other states of the data within the associated sub-arrays. In a preferred embodiment, the invention conducts a search on a predetermined subset of the data and only continues the search for the rest of the array if that subset matches and the word is determined to be &ldquo;valid&rdquo;. More specifically, the invention simultaneously begins a search in the first section <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (valid bit(s)) and the second section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (which contains a subset of actual data). The successful result of the two parallel comparisons conditionally enable a search of the third section <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by bringing low the sinkline (providing a ground wire to discharge the third array&apos;s matchline). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the first example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there may be one valid bit per word (where an 8-bit word may stored in two 4-bit sub-arrays) as the first CAM cell array <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and four bits per word in the second CAM cell array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. However, as would be known by one ordinarily skilled in the art, the invention is equally applicable to content addressable memories that include many valid bits and subsequent data cell arrays that have a different number of data bits per word, array or sub-array. Only in the event of a match on the first two arrays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, does the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> activate the search on the third CAM cell array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the comparator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that performs an OR operation of the matchline <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the valid signal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. With respect to the first and second sub-arrays to be tested, the matchline <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the valid signal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the sinkline <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are all active low. As mentioned above, only when the matchline <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is low indicating that the data in the second CAM cell array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> matches, and the valid signal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is low indicating that the data within the array is valid, will the sinkline <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> drop to a low voltage level to indicate the match in the first two sub-arrays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. When the search data mismatches the stored data in the third sub-array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> discharges through the compare transistors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Since the voltage of both the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are equal, this indicates a mismatch. If the search data matches the stored data in the third sub-array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the compare transistors <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> do not provide a path from the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and so their voltages remain different to indicate a match. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Additional sub-arrays can be compared in parallel as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> depict. Additional sub-arrays would be added by increasing the number of inputs on the OR logic gate. It is preferable that the majority of the bits would be in the last sub-array, so that the most power would be saved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The comparator in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which represents the first sense amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, is shown in sub-arrays in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. More specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates parallel sets of four cells <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the second CAM cell array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a single valid cell <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (first CAM cell array <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). The precharge devices <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are also illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> except the first CAM cell array <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown having three bits <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, in addition a precharge device <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for the valid signal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is illustrated. As discussed above, the comparator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> only produces a low voltage sinkline <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> when the matchlines <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> indicate matching data and the valid signal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> indicates that the data within the array is valid. Using a static gate within comparator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provides decreased power consumption by decreasing the capacitive load on the clock signal. Additionally, using a static gate to maintain the sinkline <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at either a high or a low signal provides noise immunity advantages over the existing schemes which precharge the sinkline <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> high and conditionally drive it low. Those schemes leave the sinkline <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> floating high during a compare, making it susceptible to noise, which could signal a false result. By contrast, with the invention, the sinkline is not a dynamic signal but rather a static one and does not have the aforementioned problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a fully static CAM cell <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in greater detail and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates one of the partially dynamic storage bits <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (or <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>) in greater detail. These cells are somewhat similar to the cells show in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and include a storage region <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a comparator <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. However, the comparator <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> includes a valid signal line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that is output to the comparator <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is also similar to the structure shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. However, the comparator <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a comparison output line <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that controls a transistor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> (NFET). As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, the cells <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are serially connected. The transistor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> connects the previous cell with the next cell. This signal is eventually output to the first sense amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a partial schematic diagram of the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Initially, the sense amplifier <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> receives the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the sinkline <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from the last sequential CAM cell shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1 </cross-reference>. The matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is input to an inverter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> that is also supplied with a voltage signal (Vcc) through a transistor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The transistor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is controlled by a clock signal CLK in order to precharge the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> between searches. Then, the inverter <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> outputs a signal <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> to an OR gate <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which combines with the sinkline signal <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and sends its output <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> to be interpreted as an active low match address, typically interpreted next by a priority encoder (which is well known in those trained in the art). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The cells <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are held in the mismatch condition between cycles (both match bitlines, (MBLC and MBLT) are held high) to keep transistor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> off and permit precharge <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to keep matchline <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates two exemplary operations (T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) of the signal waveforms of the sinkline and matchline. For the first rise of the CCLK (e.g., T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), the data results in a match in the first two sub-arrays (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>), so the sinkline falls and enables the compare for the third sub-arrays <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The third sub-arrays <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> mismatches and discharges the matchline into the sinkline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the second rise of the CCLK (e.g., T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), there is a mismatch in the first two sub-arrays of the data, so the sinkline and matchline stay high, disabling the match for the third sub-array. Even though the third sub-array may mismatch, since the sinkline stays high, the matchline cannot be discharged, thus resulting in power savings when the sinkline and matchline do not need to be precharged before the next compare operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The second sense amplifier <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> signals a match if and only if the sinkline is low and the matchline is high. If both the matchline and sinkline are high, there is a mismatch in at least one of the first two sub-arrays, and if both the matchline and the sinkline are low, the third subset is mismatched. There is not a case where the matchline is low and the sinkline is high. The invention is shown in a flowchart form in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, in item <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the invention precharges the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Then, in item <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the invention tests the first and second arrays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with the comparison data. If the comparison data mismatches the first array <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>), then the invention discontinues any additional comparison processes, as indicated by item <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Similarly, if the comparison data does not match the data contained within the second array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>), no additional comparison processes are performed (<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) and neither the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> nor the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> To the contrary, if the comparison data matches both the valid data <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the first sub-array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in items <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> discharges and the subsequent sub-array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is tested <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the comparison data is compared to the data contained within the third array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to determine whether a match exists (<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>). If the data does not match, the process ends in item <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> indicating a mismatch. Otherwise, the invention indicates that a match is found in item <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates a similar but more detailed flowchart where the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are precharged in item <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In a similar manner to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the first and second sub-arrays <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are tested in item <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. If the comparison data is not determined to be valid with the data in the first sub-array <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>), the process returns to item <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> voltage remains at the precharged state. Similarly, if the comparison data does not match the data within the second array <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>), the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> voltage remains high indicating that a mismatch has been found (<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> To the contrary, if the comparison data is valid (<highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>) and matches the second sub-array (<highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>), then, in item <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> voltage falls. A fall in the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> voltage allows the third sub-array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to be tested in item <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. If the comparison data matches the data in the third sub array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>), the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> remains at the precharged high voltage, as shown in item <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. The low sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> voltage and the high matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> voltage indicates that a match has been found in item <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. To the contrary, if the comparison data does not match the data contained within the third sub-array <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, a mismatch condition <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> occurs and the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> voltage falls in item <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Therefore, as shown above, the instances in which the matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will discharge is substantially reduced when compared to conventional systems. This power savings is substantial when compared to the circuit as a whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, for the vast majority of the time, input data does not match the data stored within the sub-arrays. For example, if 4 bits were in the second array, assuming that the second array is filled with random data, and a search is conducted with random data, the chance of a match is (&frac12;)<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>, or {fraction (1/16)}&equals;6.25%. Therefore, with the invention, the matchline <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> would need to be precharged only 6.25% of the time. This means that the invention would only need to waste power on a full search 6.25% of the time. All things being equal, this modified array would consume {fraction (1/16)} the power of a conventional array; however, the additional power of adding a sinkline doubles the power consumed in a search on the third array, so average data would show a 1&minus;&frac18;(1&minus;0.126)&equals;87.5% average theoretical power savings over conventional matchline structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> By using a sinkline based architecture, there is an inherent power savings because of the invention&apos;s architecture. Without a sinkline, the match bitlines must be precharged to prevent a compare operation during the precharge event on the matchline. With a sinkline driven high during the matchline precharge event, the match bitlines are rendered irrelevant. Using statistically random data, there is a 50% probability that the match bitlines will contain the same data for two consecutive operations. Therefore, the match bitline structure (data drivers and the compare FETs) will end up saving 50% of the match bitline power because they would not need to switch in that case. This can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> wherein if the sinkline <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and matchline <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are both at a high voltage, turning the compare transistors on and off (as the prior art does in precharging) has no effect. Only when the sinkline voltage drops will the match bitlines trigger a compare. This assures the designer that this timing restraint is met. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As shown above, the invention reduces the number of times the matchline must be precharged by reducing the situations in which the matchline may discharge. The valid cell <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and sinkline <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> prevent the matchline <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> from discharging unless specific circumstances occur. Matchline power consumption goes up as the number of bits in a word increase. Match bitline power consumption goes up as the number of words in the array goes up. Therefore, the invention can produce even greater power savings as the sizes of the arrays and sizes of the words increase. Power is also saved by only comparing data words that have been marked as &ldquo;valid&rdquo; within the scope of the application. In the event that a word is marked invalid, only the first two sub-arrays compare, leaving the presumably largest subset of the data to save power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in terms of preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
