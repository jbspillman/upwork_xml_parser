<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A chuck grips the housing of a hub assembly to hold it fast and further engages a hub spindle that is within the housing and rotates the spindle on a bearing that is between it and the housing so that a flange on the hub may be machined with precision. The chuck includes a fixed base that carries jaws which clamp down on the housing to firmly hold the housing. It also includes a rotatable base and an arbor carried by the rotatable base and engaged with the spindle of the hub to impart the rotation of the hub. The arbor can shift radially with respect to the rotating base to accommodate misalignment between the axes of rotation for the hub and the rotating base. A bearing lies between the arbor and rotating base to resist an axially directed force applied to the arbor to expand it in the hub spindle. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to chucks, and more particularly, to a chuck for holding a hub assembly and rotating a component of the assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Automotive manufacturers have turned more and more to packaged components in the assembly of their vehicles. Often, outside suppliers provide these components, thus saving the vehicle manufacturers the expense and problems of maintaining manufacturing facilities for them. The hub assemblies for the road wheels of the vehicles represent one type of component which lends itself well to outside manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Many automobile and sport utility vehicles of current manufacture have all of their road wheels independently suspended. Packaged hub assemblies function well for mounting the wheels of these vehicles on the independent suspension systems of the vehicles. The typical hub assembly has a hub provided with a flange, to which a road wheel and a brake disk or drum are fastened, and a spindle which projects from the flange into a housing. Here the spindle rotates on a bearing that is within the housing. The housing in turn is bolted to a component of the suspension system, such as a steering knuckle. The bearing normally takes the form of a double row tapered roller bearing or a double row angular contact ball bearing. Either will accommodate radial loads and in addition thrust loads in both axial directions. Moreover, the manufacturers of the hub assemblies normally set the bearings to a condition of slight preload, thus eliminating all radial and axial clearances in the bearings. This enables the hub of a hub assembly to rotate about an axis that is fixed with respect to the housing, but does not eliminate runout (wobble) in the hub flange. And runout in the flange will translate into runout in a brake disk which is against the flange. Runout in a brake disk causes uneven brake wear and creates a pulsating sensation, known as &ldquo;brake judder&rdquo;, when the brakes are applied. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,158,124 discloses machining the friction surface of a brake disk while it is fastened to its hub and the hub is rotated on its bearing, all while the housing is held fast. U.S. Pat. No. 6,071,180 discloses grinding the face of a hub flange in similar manner. However, gripping the hub to rotate it has always proved troublesome in that the axis of the hub may not coincide with the axis of rotation established by the bearing. This makes it difficult to couple the hub with a chuck designed to rotate it. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention resides in a chuck having a fixed member that carries jaws that are capable of gripping the housing of a hub assembly and a rotatable member to which an arbor is coupled, with the arbor being capable of engaging a hub that rotates in the housing on a bearing. The arbor has the capacity to shift radially with respect to the rotatable member to accommodate misalignment between the axes of rotation for the rotatable member and the hub. The invention also resides in the combination of the chuck and the hub assembly. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) a chuck A clamps down on a component of a hub assembly B and further rotates another component of the hub assembly B, so that a surface on that other component&mdash;or for that matter a surface carried by that other component&mdash;may be machined. The hub assembly B (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) is furnished as a package ready for installation on a component C of a vehicular suspension system. The hub assembly B later has a road wheel D and a brake disk E attached to it. The suspension system component C may take the form of a steering knuckle, in which event it has the capacity to pivot about a generally vertical axis as well as move vertically, or it may simply move vertically. In the former configuration it is suitable for use with front wheels D that steer the vehicle, whereas in the latter configuration it is suitable for trailing rear wheels D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Irrespective of the configuration and capabilities of the suspension system component C on which the hub assembly B is mounted, the hub assembly B, which the chuck A holds and rotates prior to installation on the suspension system component C, includes (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) a housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, a hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and a bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> that is located between the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to enable the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to rotate on the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> about an axis X with minimal friction. The housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is configured to be attached securely to the suspension system component C during the assembly of the vehicle, whereas the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is configured to accommodate the brake disk E and the road wheel D. The bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> transfers both radial and thrust loads in both axial directions between the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on its exterior has a triangular or rectangular flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a machined cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that extends from the flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the inboard end of the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a machined end face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that lies perpendicular to the cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The segment of the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> lying inwardly from the flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, that is the segment having the machined surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, fits into the suspension system component C, thus bringing the end face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> against the component C to which it is secured with cap screws that thread into its lobes. On its interior, the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> has a pair of tapered raceways <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which taper downwardly toward each other and thus have their largest ends at the ends of the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The raceways <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> actually form part of the bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and in a sense the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> constitutes the outer race of the bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes a spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which extends into the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a flange <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> formed integral with the spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the outboard end of the spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The flange <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> extends radially outwardly just past the flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. It has a mounting surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which is presented outwardly away from housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and is machined such that it lies in a plane that is perpendicular to the axis X. The mounting surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> surrounds a wheel pilot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which projects axially beyond the surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the flange <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has several threaded studs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> fitted to it and they likewise project axially beyond the mounting surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The brake disk E fits over the threaded studs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and around the wheel pilot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so that it bears against mounting surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The wheel D fits over the studs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and against the brake disk E. It also fits around the pilot <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which serves to center it. The brake disk E and wheel D are clamped tightly to the flange <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by lug nuts <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which thread over the studs <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> On its opposite face, that is its inboard face, the flange <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a shoulder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> where it merges into the spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. At its inboard end, the spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> turns outwardly away from the axis X in the provision of a formed end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is hollow and internally has a machined cylindrical bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that opens out of the formed end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. It may also have an internal spline located beyond the bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> fits around the spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between the shoulder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the formed end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and also fits within the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. It includes an inner race in the form of two cones <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&mdash;one an outboard cone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that is against the shoulder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the other an inboard cone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that is against the formed end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Each cone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a tapered raceway <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a thrust rib <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at the large end of the tapered raceway <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The thrust rib <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of each cone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extends out to a back face <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that is squared off with respect to the axis X. The two cones <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> fit over the spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with an interference fit and with the back face <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the outboard cone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> against the shoulder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the back face of the inboard cone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> against the formed end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> With the two cones <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so disposed, the tapered raceway <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the outboard cone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is presented toward the outboard raceway <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and inclined in the same direction as that raceway <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The raceway <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the inboard cone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is presented toward the inboard raceway <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the housing <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and inclined in the same direction as that raceway <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The opposite ends, that is to say the front faces, of the two cones <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> abut generally within the center of the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In addition to the two cones <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the raceway <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> includes tapered rollers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> arranged in two rows, there being an outboard row between outboard raceways <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and an inboard row between the inboard raceways <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The rollers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> contact the raceways <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> along their tapered side faces, there being basically line contact here, and they bear against the thrust ribs <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at their large end faces. Indeed, the thrust ribs <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> prevent the rollers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> from being expelled from the opposed raceway <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the rollers <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in each row are on apex, meaning that the envelopes of all rollers in a row will have their apices at a common point along the axis X. Furthermore, the bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> exists in a condition of preload, which means that no radial or axial clearances exists within it, this being achieved by grinding the front face of one of the cones <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, if necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Beyond its two raceways <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is fitted with seals <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which establish fluid barriers along the thrust ribs <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the two cones <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&mdash;barriers which retain a lubricant within the bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and exclude contaminant from it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The formed end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> unitizes the hub assembly B and is produced only after the two cones <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are installed over the spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Initially, the spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the hub extends from the shoulder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to its free end as a cylindrical surface capable of accommodating the cones <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. First, the outboard cone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is installed over the extended spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, then the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and then the inboard cone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. With the two cones <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in place a segment of the spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> projects beyond the back face <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the inboard cone <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This segment is deformed into the formed end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. PCT application GB 98/01923 (International Publication No. WO98/58762), discloses a rotary forming process for upsetting the initially extended end of the spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and converting that end into the formed end <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which captures the cones <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on the spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and in effect unitizes the entire hub assembly B. The hub assembly B may also be unitized with a nut threaded over the end of the spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The preload that exists within the bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> assures stability between the fixed housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the rotating hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, that is to say, the axis X remains fixed with respect to the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. But the presence of preload does not assure that the mounting surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> will rotate without runout&mdash;in other words, wobble&mdash;and any runout in the mounting surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is imparted to the brake disk E which is machined separately from the hub assembly B. To assure that the mounting surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> revolves without runout, the surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is machined while the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> rotates in the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the preloaded bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. During the machining of the surface <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> the chuck A holds the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> fast and further rotates the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The chuck A is fitted to a machine tool F having a headstock <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and a spindle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which rotates in the headstock <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> about an axis Y (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The spindle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is hollow and contains a hydraulically operated draw bar <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The machine tool F also has a cutting tool <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which it advances radially with respect to the axis Y. The chuck A includes a clamping section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which is fastened firmly to the headstock <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the machine tool F and a mandrel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which is connected to the spindle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> for rotation with it. The clamping section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> clamps down on and grips the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the hub assembly B, holding it fast, whereas the mandrel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> engages the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the hub assembly B and rotates it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Considering the clamping section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> first, it includes a base <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which is fastened firmly to the headstock <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and has a cylindrical cavity <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, which opens toward the spindle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and receives the mandrel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In addition, the base <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> has a cylindrical bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> which opens away from the spindle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Between the cavity <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is a cylindrical intervening surface <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> along which an O-ring seal <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is located. The base <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> also contains two ports <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, the former of which opens into the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at the closed end of the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and the later into the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> near its opposite end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The cylindrical bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> contains a piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which has an O-ring seal <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> that wipes the surface of the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> between the two ports <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> also has an annular rib <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> which projects rearwardly along the intervening surface <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> where the O-ring seal <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> wipes it. The piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> possesses an annular configuration and along its hollow center has an annular nose <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> which projects forwardly around the mandrel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Finally, the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> contains several sockets <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> which open out of its forward face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> lies behind an annular jaw carrier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that is fastened firmly against the base <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> with machine screws and has an outer O-ring seal <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that effects a static seal with the surface of the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in the base <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and an inner O-ring seal <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> which establishes a live seal with the nose <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> on the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The back of the carrier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in effect closes the end of cylindrical bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> around <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, so that the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> divides the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> into two chambers&mdash;one a back chamber into which the port <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> opens and the other a front chamber into which the port <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> opens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The jaw carrier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has dowels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> which project from its back face into the sockets <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to prevent the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> from rotating in the cylindrical bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Yet the dowels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> do not impede axial displacement of the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> in the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The carrier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> projects forwardly beyond the base <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and beyond the nose <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and at its forward end is provided with a beveled camming surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> which is presented inwardly toward the axis Y. Here, the carrier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is also fitted with a stop ring <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> which is attached firmly to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Within the carrier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is a clamping member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having a solid annular end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> which threads over the nose <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> on the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. In addition, the clamping member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> has several jaws <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>) which are formed integral with and extend forwardly from the annular end <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, terminating within the beveled camming surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Each jaw <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> has a beveled outside face <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> which bears against the camming surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and an arcuate gripping surface <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> that is presented inwardly toward the axis Y. The contour of each gripping surface <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> matches the contour of the machined cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the hub assembly B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> When pressurized fluid, such as compressed air, is admitted to the port <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> behind the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> moves forwardly and the jaws <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, owing to the resiliency of the metal from which they are formed, follow the camming surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and spread apart. On the other hand, when pressurized fluid is admitted to the port <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> moves rearwardly and carries the clamping member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with it. The beveled camming surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> bears against the jaws <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and urges them together, causing the envelope formed by the gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to contract. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the mandrel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), it has a base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> which is secured firmly against the front face of the machine tool spindle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> with machine screws, and projects forwardly in a stepped configuration from the spindle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Indeed, it extends into the cavity <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of the clamping section base <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, then into the rib <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> on the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and finally completely through the nose <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Enough clearance exists between the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, on one hand, and the clamping section base <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, on the other hand, to enable the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> to rotate freely within the clamping section base <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> also has a throughbore <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, a large counterbore <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> at the back end of the throughbore <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, and a smaller counterbore <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> at the forward end. In addition, at the large counterbore <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> it has sockets <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> which open into the counterbore <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and toward the machine tool spindle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The exterior surface of the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> as well as the throughbore <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and the two counterbores <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> all are concentric and share the axis Y of the machine tool spindle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> as their common center. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The mandrel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> also includes a draw bar adapter <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> which constitutes an extension of the draw bar <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Indeed, the adapter <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, in effect, extends the draw bar <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to the forward face of the machine tool spindle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> where the adapter <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> has an enlarged end <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> that is free to shift axially within the spindle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, but for all intents and purposes not radially. The adapter <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> rotates with the spindle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> about the axis Y. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In addition to the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and the draw bar adapter <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, the mandrel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> includes a connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> which for the most part is confined within the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, although it does project forwardly out of the forward end of the base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> has the capacity to shift radially a small distance within the base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and axially an even greater distance, the latter being a consequence of actuation of the draw bar <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> includes a head <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> which is confined to the large counterbore <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and a cylindrical shank <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> which extends from the head <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> through the throughbore <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and small counterbore <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and beyond the forward end of the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The diameter of the throughbore <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> exceeds the diameter of the shank <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and likewise the diameter of the large counterbore <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> exceeds the diameter of the head <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, the differences in diameter being such that the connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> can shift laterally from a centered position a distance of at least 0.020 in. in any direction. Moreover, the depth of the large counterbore <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> exceeds the axial dimension of the head <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> by about at least 0.160 in., so the maximum stroke of the connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> in the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is 0.160 in. The head <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> contains several axially directed bores <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> which receive shoulder bolts <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> that thread into the head <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the draw bar adapter <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>&mdash;indeed, until the shoulders on those bolts <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> bear firmly against the enlarged end <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the draw bar adapter <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The smooth shanks of the shoulder bolts <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> lie within the bores <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the connector head <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> and the differences in diameter between the shanks of the bolts <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and the bores <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are such that the head <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>&mdash;and indeed, the entire connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>&mdash;can move at least 0.020 off the axis Y for the mandrel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The heads of the shoulder bolts <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> fit within the sockets <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, and this enables the connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to rotate with the base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Fitted around the shank of each shoulder bolt <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, between the head of the bolt <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and the front face of the head <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> for the connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, is a bearing <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> which transfers the axially directed force exerted on the draw bar adapter <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> by the draw bar <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to the connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, while enabling the connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to move laterally in the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> with minimal friction. Thus, the shoulder bolts <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> function as draw elements for drawing the connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> inwardly. Each bearing <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> includes (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) a pair of flat washers <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, rolling elements in the form of hardened balls <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> between the washers <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, and a cage <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> located between the washers <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and having pockets which receive the balls <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and maintain a uniform spacing between them. One of the washers <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> bears against the front face of the connector head <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, while the other bears against the underside of the head on the shoulder bolt <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The shank <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> of the connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> projects beyond the front end of the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> where it is received in an arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> that extends forwardly to the region of the jaws <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> on the clamping section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Just enough clearance exists between the connector shank <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and the interior surface of the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> to enable the shank <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> to shift axially in the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> without binding. In this region the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> has a flange <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> provided with several axial bores <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> through which more shoulder bolts <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> extend. The bolts <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> thread into the end of the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, with their shoulders bearing against the front face of the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and their heads over, although not tightly against, the front face of the flange <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the diameter of the axial bore <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> exceeds the diameter of the shanks on the bolts <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> sufficiently to enable the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and the connector shank <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> confined by it to shift laterally at least 0.020 in. in any direction off the axis Y of the mandrel <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> at its opposite end includes an enlarged head <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> through which a bore <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> extends. The head <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, which is segmented by radial slots (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), has arcuate gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> on its exterior and beveled camming surfaces <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> at the end of the bore <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. When the head <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is undistorted, the diameter of the gripping surface <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> is just small enough to fit into the machined bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at the end of the hub spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for the hub assembly B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The bore <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> of the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> receives an expander <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> having a beveled end <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> which bears against the beveled camming surfaces <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> of the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. The opposite end of the expander <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> is threaded into the end of the shank <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> on the connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. Thus, an axially directed force exerted by the draw bar <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is transferred through the draw bar adapter <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to the expander <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> which retracts within the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. In doing so, the beveled end of the expander <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> moves along the camming surfaces <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> in the head <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, causing the head <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> to expand and increase the diameter of the envelope formed by the arcuate gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight>. Hence, the connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and expander <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> comprise an actuating member or expanding the enlarged head <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The expander <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, of course, exerts an axially directed force on the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and that force is resisted by the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, it being transferred to the base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> through a bearing <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> located in the small counterbore <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> at the front of the base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The bearing <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> likewise has (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) a pair of flat washers <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> with balls <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> located between them and a cage <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight> separating the balls <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> so that they remain uniformly spaced. The bearing <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> is thick enough to back the flange <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> of the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> slightly away from the front face of the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, yet not so thick as to force it against the heads of the shoulder bolts <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Thus, the flange <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> floats, so to speak, at the end of the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Indeed, the loose fits between the shanks of the shoulder bolts <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and the axial bores <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in the head <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and the loose fits between the shanks of the shoulder bolts <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and the flange <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> of the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, together with the bearings <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and the bearing <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> enable the connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and the expander <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> to float as a unit in and on the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, even though an axial directed force is transferred through the draw bar adapter <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> and connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to the expander <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> To prepare the chuck A for machining the mounting surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that forms the front face of the flange <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the hub assembly B, compress air is admitted to the port <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in the base <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the clamping section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. This drives the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and clamping member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> forwardly away from the headstock <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and spindle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The beveled outside faces <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the jaws <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> ride up the camming surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of the carrier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the jaws <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> expand under the resiliency of the clamping member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Also, the draw bar <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is driven forwardly, shifting the connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and expander <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> forwardly as well. The head <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, owning to resilience of the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, assumes a contracted configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> With the chuck A so configured, the hub assembly B is installed on it. In particular, the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the hub assembly B, with its inboard end leading is inserted into the open jaws <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> on the clamping section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and advanced until the machined end face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> bears against the stop ring <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> on the jaw carrier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. When the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is aligned with the open jaws <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the machined bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at the inboard end of the hub spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> aligns with the head <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> at the end of the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. As the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> advances into the jaws <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, the arbor head <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> advances into the machined bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Once the housing flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is against the stop ring <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>, the pressure at the port <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> in the clamping section base <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is relaxed and compress air is admitted to the other port <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. This draws the piston <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and the clamping member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> rearwardly. The beveled outside faces <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the jaws <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> on the clamping member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> move over the camming surface <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> on the carrier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and the jaws <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> contract. Their gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> bear firmly against the machined cylindrical surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> on the exterior of the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for the hub assembly B. The end face <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the flange <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> remains against the stop ring <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the draw bar <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is energized, and it retracts the draw bar adapter <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> in the machine tool spindle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> also retracts in the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and draws the expander <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> farther into the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>, causing its beveled head <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> to move against the camming surfaces <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> in the enlarged head <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. The arbor head <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> expands and its gripping surfaces <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> bear firmly against the surface of the machine bore <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the hub spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> With the jaws <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> clamped against the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> engaged with the hub spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the machine tool spindle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is energized. It rotates the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> about the axis Y, and the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> in turn rotates the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. Being firmly engaged with the hub spindle <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the arbor rotates the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> about the axis X. Since the bearing <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, which accommodates the rotation of the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is set to preload, the axis X remains fixed with respect to the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and the clamping section <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> which holds the housing <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. However, the axis X about which the hub <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> rotates may not coincide with the axis Y about which the machine tool spindle <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> rotates. The floating connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> accommodate any misalignment between the axes X and Y. After all, the clearance between the shanks of the shoulder bolts <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and the bores <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> through which they extend in the head <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, and likewise the clearance between the shanks of the shoulder bolts <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> and the axial bores in the flange <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> of the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> enable the connector <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and the arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> to shift laterally in and on the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The bearings <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> enable the axial force exerted by the draw bar <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to be transmitted to the arbor expander <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> and to be resisted by the mandrel base <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> notwithstanding the float of the connector <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and arbor <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
