<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention describes in detail the construction and operation of a CMOS Active Pixel Image Sensor that consists of pixels formed by only two transistors. The sensor can be fabricated with very small pixels sizes, which have only two metal contacts in them, have in-pixel offset non-uniformity correction, and bootstrapped reset lines. These features are achieved by employing the transistor body effect as the main photo-generated charge sensing means. The bootstrapped reset lines allow the sensor to operate at low bias voltages.

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to solid-state image sensors and specifically to Active Pixel CMOS image sensors that have only two transistors in each pixel. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> State of the art CMOS image sensors have typically three or more transistors per pixel and are addressed and reset with two or more row lines. The pixels are also supplied with a power supply line and the output is obtained through a column sense line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A typical circuit schematic diagram <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of a standard CMOS pixel is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As light impinges on the pixel photodiode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the diode is discharged and the resulting voltage of node <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is supplied to the gate of the sensing transistor <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. When a particular row &ldquo;Yn&rdquo; is ready to be addressed, the addressing signal is applied to line <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, which turns the transistor <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> on. This connects the signal appearing on the source of the transistor <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> through the interconnect <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to column line <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The current source load <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> loads the column sense line &ldquo;Xm&rdquo;. After the sensing is completed, the reset line <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> is pulsed, which resets the node <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> through the reset transistor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to the original level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The whole cycle of sensing and resetting is periodically repeated when the sensor is used in a movie mode or is terminated just after one cycle when the sensor is used in a still picture mode. The drain of the reset transistor <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is connected together with the drain of the sense transistor <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, and further through the interconnect <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> to the Vdd bus line <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Separate lines for the reset and Vdd are also possible. The voltage waveform that appears on the node <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is shown in the graph <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. When the reset pulse <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is applied to the pixel, the node voltage is reset to level <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> that corresponds to dark signal. The light impinging on the photodiode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> gradually discharges the node causing the node voltage to follow an approximately linear line <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> assuming that the light intensity is constant. When an address pulse <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> is applied to the pixel, the source voltage is sensed and delivered to column processing circuits. The new reset pulse <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> then restores the pixel original dark level <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>. More information about Active Pixel Image (APS) Sensor design and operation can be found in the paper: &ldquo;CMOS Image Sensor: Electronic Camera On a Chip&rdquo; Eric Fossum published in the IEDM Technical Digest 1995 pp. 17-25. Additional information is also available in the U.S. Pat. No. 5,471,575 to Fossum at al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> APS image sensors have advantages in low power consumption, high speed, require only low bias voltages, and can be produced with low cost. However, the complexity of the pixel design leads to a sacrifice of some light collecting area, which ultimately results in lower QE. Another disadvantage is in pixel-offset non-uniformities that are caused by the threshold variations of pixel transistors. The resulting pixel signal has to be processed to remove these non-uniformities. Pixels in each column can share the column processing circuitry, however, these circuits typically require at least two large capacitors for the offset subtraction and data storage, which may consume a significant portion of the chip area. Another problem resulting from the complex pixel circuitry is the need for several contacts between the transistor gates, source and drain regions, and metal busing. The pixel circuit <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, requires at least three contacts. The contacts are also consuming pixel area, obstruct light, and prevent pixel size reduction beyond a certain limit. It is therefore desirable to reduce the pixel complexity and more importantly to reduce the number of in-pixel contacts. It is also desirable to simplify the pixel-offset non-uniformity processing circuits and minimize the number of large signal storage capacitors in each column. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is the purpose of this invention to teach how to overcome the above-described limitations and how to achieve, small pixel size, fewer transistors per pixel, and fewer in-pixel contacts, and to teach how to compensate pixel offset non-uniformities by storing the corrective signal in the pixel itself. The prior art does not show how to design an Active Pixel CMOS image sensor with a small pixel size that has only two transistors per pixel and only two in-pixel contacts. The prior art does not teach how to compensate for pixel offset non-uniformities by storing the error-compensating signal in the pixel itself. Finally the prior art does not teach how to improve the image sensor performance at low biasing voltages by bootstrapping the reset gate signal. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an Active Pixel CMOS image sensor that has only two transistors in each pixel, in-pixel offset non-uniformity correction, and bootstrapped reset lines. The reduced number of active pixel elements leads to higher Quantum Efficiency (QE) and smaller pixel size. The unique pixel row addressing and reset technique that uses only a single line further improves the sensor&apos;s QE. Separate column lines for the pixel output and reset reference allow for efficient compensation of pixel-offset non-uniformities. The pixel-offset non-uniformities are individually detected after each photo-generated signal has been read out. Special array column or array external processing circuits compute the corresponding pixel non-uniformity error-compensating signal and supply it back through the reset line to each pixel. As a result the photo-generated signal is always referenced to an absolute reference level free of any pixel-offset error. This type of non-uniformity correction thus reduces the number of column capacitors, normally needed for the standard non-uniformity correction and data storage, since the offset compensation is stored in the pixel itself. This technique significantly reduces the chip size and eventually the cost of the sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These and other objects are achieved by using the body effect of p-type transistor as the main photo-signal sensing means. The n-well region containing the p-type transistor is reset to a reference voltage by a second n-type pixel transistor and then left floating. Impinging light creates electron-hole pairs and collected electrons are changing potential of the n-well. The potential changes modulate the threshold of the p-type transistor and these changes then represent the pixel output signal. The reset reference for each pixel is adjustable individually to compensate for the intrinsic p-type transistor threshold variations. This feature, when activated, effectively cancels the pixel-offset non-uniformities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention includes incorporation of trench isolation into each pixel. The trench isolation allows reducing the transient regions between the p-type and the n-type doping regions within the pixel and between the pixels of the array. This in turn leads to reduction of pixel size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Yet additional embodiment of the invention includes the stacked double poly reset line that generates bootstrapped reset signal for the n-well reset transistor. This allows resetting the n-well to a higher voltage level, which increases the pixel output voltage swing and thus the overall sensor Dynamic Range. This feature is important when low bias voltages are required to operate the sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The main advantage of the above-described pixel structure is that it contains only two transistors and consequently requires only two contacts to the array bus lines. The n-type transistor resets the n-well without the need for in-pixel metal interconnects and thus the pixel does not need additional contacts. This leads to an aggressive pixel size reduction without any significant sacrifice in the sensor sensitivity and QE.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Simplified circuit diagrams <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> for two versions of the CMOS pixel of the invention are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The pixel consists of one p-type transistor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> that is formed in a standard CMOS n-type well <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and one n-type transistor <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. The drain of a p-type transistor is connected to p-type substrate by extending the p&plus; drain region over the n-well edge. This feature eliminates the need for a metal interconnect. The source of transistor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is connected to column signal bus line <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> by the interconnect <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>. The column signal bus line is shared by all the pixels in the same column and is loaded by a suitable current source <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. N-type transistor <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is used for the reset, and when turned on, it resets the n-well <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to a potential that is present on the bus line <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> at that moment. Each pixel in the same column can thus be reset to a different reset level since the pixels are reset at different times. The interconnect <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> connects the drain of transistor <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> to column reset bus line <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. The n&plus; source of transistor <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is connected to the n-well <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> similarly as that of the p-type transistor, which is by extending the n&plus; diffusion over the edge of the p-region or p-well. Gates of both transistors <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> are connected to the same address line <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> even thou this is not always necessary since separate lines for the address transistor <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight> and the reset transistors <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> can be provided as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>Since the transistors are of a different conductivity type, it is possible to distinguish the reset from addressing in case of the common line just by applying different polarity pulses. The reset is accomplished by a positive pulse excursion while the addressing is accomplished by a negative pulse excursion. For more clarity, the signal waveforms appearing on the n-well <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and on the source node of transistor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> are shown in the graph <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The n-well <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is reset to a potential level <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> by the reset pulse <highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>, and photo-generated carriers causes the level to drop along the line <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> providing that photon flux is constant during this interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The n-well potential change is affecting the threshold voltage of transistor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> through the body effect phenomenon and the potential of transistor <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> source is changed accordingly starting from the reset level <highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight> along the line <highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight> as indicated by the dotted curve if it were turned on. However, the transistor is turned off, since its gate is not addressed when biased to an intermediate V<highlight><subscript>m </subscript></highlight>level <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. When address pulse <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> is applied, the transistor turns on and the potential level <highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight> is supplied to the column sense line as the pixel output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> An example of one possible pixel layout <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Regions <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> represent address lines that are typically formed from a single polysilicon layer. As will be explained later, the lines can also be formed as stacked structures of two polysilicon layers separated by a suitable dielectric. This is not visible in the drawing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Region <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> indicates the n-well. The P-type substrate or p-well is the region <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, which is everything outside the n-well <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. Region <highlight><bold>507</bold></highlight> defines a p-type transistor with its drain overlapping the n-well <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to facilitate the drain to substrate connection as explained previously. Similarly, region <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> defines a n-type transistor with its source overlapping the n-well <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> to make the required connection. Metal bus lines <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, for reset, and <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>, for signal, are slightly offset, but this is only for the purpose of drawing clarity. In practice they may be located on top of each other and elsewhere in the pixel. Transistor contacts to corresponding bus lines are indicated in the drawing by dots <highlight><bold>509</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For more clarity a pixel cross section <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The cross section is taken through the line <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Structures <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> correspond directly to regions <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>Region <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> is the p&plus; type substrate on which the p-type bulk material is epitaxially grown. Other substrate materials and material combinations are possible as can be easily surmised by those skilled in the art. Transistor&apos;s active regions with thin gate oxide <highlight><bold>613</bold></highlight> and inactive field regions <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> with thick oxide are also standard in the industry. Other doped regions, to prevent parasitic channel formations, transistor punch-through, and other unwanted phenomena, are not indicated in the drawing since they are not essential for this invention and are well known to those skilled in the art of CMOS technology. One important detail, however, is the region <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> under the p-type transistor gate <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>. This region includes a combination of suitable p-type and n-type doping layers that optimize the p-type transistor threshold and at the same time maximize its body effect. Particular doping levels and energies are easily obtained by simulations and experiments and are unique to each device design. It is therefore not practical to specify them here in any more detail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Another example of possible pixel layout is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In this embodiment the trench isolation regions <highlight><bold>551</bold></highlight> are used to minimize the transition regions between the p-well <highlight><bold>553</bold></highlight> and n-well <highlight><bold>552</bold></highlight> doping. The trench also reduces the n-well capacitance, which increases the pixel conversion factor. The p-channel transistor <highlight><bold>557</bold></highlight> and the n-channel transistor <highlight><bold>558</bold></highlight>, with the common gate <highlight><bold>556</bold></highlight>, correspond to the same structures in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The metal buss lines have been omitted in this figure, but the contact holes <highlight><bold>559</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>560</bold></highlight> are indicated. The simplified device cross-section taken through the line <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>is shown on the drawing in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight>The structures <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>correspond directly to structures <highlight><bold>652</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>664</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> When CMOS image sensors are required to operate at low bias voltages, the threshold voltage of the reset transistor reduces the voltage swing of node <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) or <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). The node is typically reset to a level that is approximately a threshold voltage below V<highlight><subscript>dd</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A simplified schematic diagram <highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, illustrates a bootstrapping technique that can minimize this problem and is particularly suitable for the pixel of the invention. During the pixel integration time, switch <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> is on and the gate bus of pixel transistors <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight> is kept at an intermediate potential level Vm. For the reset, switch <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> is turned off, and reset pulse <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> is applied to the input of CMOS driver <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>. The output from driver <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> then drives the line <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>. Line <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is located directly on top of the line <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>, and is separated from it by a suitable dielectric. This arrangement forms a strong capacitive coupling between these lines. The coupling capacitance <highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> is typically much larger than all the pixel gate capacitances <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> added together, which leads only to a small pulse amplitude attenuation. When the reset pulse is applied, the full reset pulse amplitude, starting from the level V<highlight><subscript>m</subscript></highlight>, appears on the gate bus <highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>. No pixel dynamic range is sacrificed and nodes <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) or <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) can thus be fully reset to V<highlight><subscript>dd </subscript></highlight>or at least close to this level. The pixel addressing is accomplished simply by turning the switch <highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight> momentarily off and the switch <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> momentarily on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> For completeness a simplified block diagram <highlight><bold>801</bold></highlight> of a CMOS image sensor that includes the pixels of the invention is given in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows only a 2&times;2 sub array of pixels <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and block diagrams of essential peripheral circuits. Current sources <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> located at the top of the array edge are biasing the column signal lines <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight>. Vdd is supplied to the current sources through a common Vdd line <highlight><bold>803</bold></highlight>. The current sources can be switched off when not in use to save power, but this feature is not indicated in the diagram. Column reset lines <highlight><bold>805</bold></highlight> together with the column signal lines <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> interface directly with the column signal processing circuit modules <highlight><bold>815</bold></highlight>. The circuit modules are also connected to the reset reference voltage line <highlight><bold>827</bold></highlight>; the strobe clock line <highlight><bold>825</bold></highlight>, and the error-enable clock line <highlight><bold>826</bold></highlight>. The processed column signal, that is stored on the column circuit block capacitors <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight>, is supplied via interconnects <highlight><bold>816</bold></highlight> to horizontal switches <highlight><bold>817</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The horizontal switches are consecutively turned on and off by the command signals received from the horizontal scan decoder <highlight><bold>821</bold></highlight> via the lines <highlight><bold>823</bold></highlight>. Sometimes it is advantageous to replace the horizontal scan decoder by a shift register. The input into the horizontal scanner is received through bus lines <highlight><bold>824</bold></highlight>. The sequential pixel output appears on the horizontal sense line <highlight><bold>818</bold></highlight> and is amplified and buffered by the output amplifier <highlight><bold>819</bold></highlight> that drives the chip output terminal <highlight><bold>822</bold></highlight>. The array vertical scanning is accomplished by decoder <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, which supplies the necessary control signals to line drivers <highlight><bold>809</bold></highlight> and finally through them to pixel address lines <highlight><bold>807</bold></highlight>. The vertical scanner receives its input through bus <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>. An important element of the array peripheral circuits is the column-clamping switch <highlight><bold>814</bold></highlight>. The primary function of the switch is to keep the column signal lines from drifting to a high bias level, and start forward biasing the pixel&apos;s p-n junctions when there is no pixel addressed. A suitable clamping bias is supplied to all the switches via line <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>, and the switches are controlled by a command signal supplied via line <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A simplified timing diagram <highlight><bold>901</bold></highlight> that includes some of the array&apos;s essential control signals is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. The pixel addressing pulse <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> connects the pixel output form one row of pixels to the corresponding column sense lines. Prior to this moment, sense lines were clamped to the level <highlight><bold>907</bold></highlight>. The column sense lines always remain clamped to this level when no addressing pulses are applied. Addressing pulses cause the column sense lines to change their potential to a new level <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>. The level <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> is subsequently sampled by pulses <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> and stored on holding capacitors <highlight><bold>820</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) in the column signal processing circuits for a later scan and horizontal readout. In the next step reset pulse <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> is applied to the pixels followed by a new same-address pulse <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The reset pulse <highlight><bold>903</bold></highlight> resets pixels to level <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>. Since all charge from the pixels in the addressed row was removed by the reset, only dark levels <highlight><bold>909</bold></highlight> now appear on the column sense lines. The column error-processing circuits activated by pulse <highlight><bold>915</bold></highlight> process these levels and generate the reset level correction signal <highlight><bold>913</bold></highlight>. The second reset pulse <highlight><bold>905</bold></highlight> then resets the pixels again to the new offset correcting reset levels. If the pixels were addressed again the column signal would be at the level <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, which is a common reference for all the pixels in the array. The above-described process continues for the next row of pixels in the column, which generate different output levels <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> and also different dark levels <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight>. The corresponding reset corrections <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight> have now, for example, a different polarity since the level <highlight><bold>911</bold></highlight> was above the level <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>. This process thus sets all the pixels in the array to an identical dark reference, which removes all the unpleasant dark signal variations from the sensor image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the column signal processing circuitry <highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight> is shown on the circuit diagram in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. When the image sensor pixel has a small size, there is not enough room available within the column pitch to accommodate all the required pixel non-uniformity correction circuitry. The circuit schematic diagram shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> provides a solution to this problem. Both the signal and the reset error are scanned column by column and supplied to the processing bloc that is located near the image sensor array or entirely off chip. The error-processing block then supplies the correction signals back to the array. In this case the error processing circuit is only one for all the columns in the array and can be as complicated as needed or can even be using sophisticated software programmable DSP when off chip option is selected. As the individual columns are scanned, the corrections are loaded back to the proper columns of the array. A suitable wiring of switches <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight> to the horizontal scanner can easily accommodate the delay that might be encountered in the external error correcting circuits. The function of this system can be understood as follows: After the row of pixel is addressed the column signal is stored on the capacitors <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> by turning the switches <highlight><bold>1018</bold></highlight> momentarily on. This is accomplished by applying a short pulse to the line <highlight><bold>1019</bold></highlight>. After that the selected row of pixels is reset to a reference voltage supplied to the column-reset lines <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight> by switches not shown in the drawing. The same row of pixel is addressed again, which causes the zero signals to appear on the columns <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> where it becomes stored. The horizontal scanner <highlight><bold>1027</bold></highlight> then simultaneously turns the switches <highlight><bold>1021</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1017</bold></highlight> momentarily on via the control lines <highlight><bold>1023</bold></highlight>, and supplies the signal and the error data to the sense lines <highlight><bold>1026</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight>, and, at the same time, the externally computed correction to the reset level is supplied to the column reset line <highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight> of the previous column. The correction is supplied via the bus line <highlight><bold>1024</bold></highlight> and the switches <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight>. If more delay is needed for computing the reset error, the wiring lines <highlight><bold>1023</bold></highlight> that control the reset column line switches <highlight><bold>1022</bold></highlight> can skip over several columns rather than only as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
