<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to optical connectors, and more particularly to dust caps that attach to the optical connector and protect an optical fiber and ferrule from abrasion, dust and debris. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Optical fiber connectors are used to facilitate mating of optical fibers to one another in an end-to-end relationship in order to permit optical energy to be transferred between fibers. Frequently, such connectors include a ferrule for terminating the exposed end of a glass fiber. An optical ferrule is a generally cylindrical tube that is made, for example, from a ceramic material and includes an axial bore for receiving and holding an end portion of the fiber. Nevertheless, the end face of the fiber is exposed to environmental hazards such as dust, debris and abrasion during the manufacture as well as the testing and handling of connectors. So that interconnections between fibers will have low loss, it is important to protect the end face of the optical fiber when it is not in use. Accordingly, it is known to provide a dust cap, or cover, for the end portion of an optical connector, adapter or other body associated with the connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One known type of dust cap is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,363,460 to Marazzi et al. that uses a flexible flap to cap a fiber optic connector to prevent emissions from the connector. The Marazzi flexible flap allows forcible deflection of the flap area, so that a mating connector can be attached to the normally capped connector, and yet when the mating connector is removed, the flap will automatically return to the capping position. According to Marazzi, in addition to preventing the emission radiation, the flap reduces contamination materials, such as dust, from adhering to the end of the optical fiber. However, incorporating such a dust cap into each connector not only increases the cost of the connector but also requires special receptacles for receiving each connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Another known type of dust cap is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,202,949 to Hileman et al. that comprises a base portion and at least one protruding portion extending therefrom, the protruding portion includes a cavity for receiving and capping the ferrule when the dust cap is mounted to the connector. The Hileman dust cap is used with connectors having a retractable body portion that normally surrounds the ferrule when the connector is not in use. The dust cap is permanently joined to the connector via a lanyard, and appears to be frictionally coupled to the connector when the dust cap is in use. Frictional coupling is undesirable because the force required to remove the dust cap from the connector may be too great or too little. It should not fall from the connector during normal handling but still be loose enough to be easily removed. Moreover, it is desirable to completely dissociate the dust cap from the connector during normal operation because of space constraints in a densely packed connection panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a dust cap for an optical connector that satisfies the conflicting demands of being completely and easily removable from the connector when the user requires removal, and being tightly held to the connector so that it does not become detached during vigorous handling. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A dust cap according to the invention is advantageously used to protect optical fiber(s) within an optical connector from abrasion, dust and debris when the optical connector is not in normal use. The dust cap is a box-like housing having front and back ends and side walls that define a cavity. The back end of the dust cap has an opening into the cavity that is shaped to receive the optical connector. A retaining feature is included within the cavity and is positioned to interlock with a mating feature on the optical connector so that the dust cap will not detach from the connector during vigorous handling. The dust cap further includes a tubular member (boss) that is shaped to receive and enclose the optical fiber, which may be held within a ferrule. The distal end of the tubular member is closed and projects outwardly from the front end of the dust cap. The proximal end of the tubular member projects into the cavity from the front end of the dust cap and has an opening for receiving the fiber. The proximal end forms a reverse trap, which reduces the possibility of dust reaching the end face of the ferrule where the optical fiber is exposed, analogous to a dust-free surface under a book shelf. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In an illustrative embodiment of the invention, the tubular member is recessed within the cavity so that the optical plug will be well aligned with the dust cap before the ferrule enters the tubular member. This prevents the forward end of the ferrule from contacting the proximal end of the tubular member during insertion. Preferably, the distance between the back end of the dust cap and the proximal end of the tubular member is more than five millimeters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the illustrative embodiment of the invention, the dust cap is designed to interlock with an LC-type optical plug, which includes a flexible cantilever latch having a pair of shoulders that mate with the retaining feature on the dust cap. The dust cap is easily and completely removed from the connector by merely depressing the latch. In the illustrative embodiment, LC-type connectors and dust caps are attached to the ends of an optical cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The dust cap is preferably molded from a thermoplastic material as a one-piece unit, which may be color coded for identification.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention solves the problem of protecting an optical fiber from abrasion, dust and debris during times when the optical fiber is not in active use such as between manufacture and test of an optical jumper cord and during shipment. This is of particular concern in situations where the ferrule, equipped with an optical fiber, protrudes from an optical connector and is directly exposed to the environment. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a back-end perspective view of an optical connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that contains an optical fiber, which is axially positioned within a cylindrical ferrule <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that projects from the front end of a protective housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Such a connector is referred to as an optical plug. The end face of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) is flush with the end face of the ferrule <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and is vulnerable to scratching and environmental contamination during storage and handling. This is true irrespective of whether the optical fiber is made from glass or plastic or enclosed within a ferrule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> If, for example, a pair of optical fibers are interconnected together, end to end, but separated by dust particles, then there is a small air gap between the end faces of the fibers that introduces a discontinuity in the index of refraction, which leads to signal reflection and transmission loss. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> dust cap <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (sometimes also called a &ldquo;dust cover&rdquo;) is designed for easy attachment to, and quick release from, an optical connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In this example embodiment, the optical connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> preferably comprises an LC plug, which is commercially available from Lucent Technologies Inc. The LC plug has a small cross-section area and can, therefore, be used in high density cross-connection panels. It features a latching arm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and trigger <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that cooperate to facilitate the installation of the plug into a receptacle (not shown). A pair of shoulders <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> interlock the connector within the receptacle. Details regarding the design of various LC plugs are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos.: 5,481,634; 5,638,474; and 5,923,805. The latter patent discloses a connector for a plastic optical fiber, which also benefits from the dust cap <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Attached to the connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is a length of optical cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> containing one or more fibers within a sheath system that typically includes tensile strength members, such as aramid fibers, and an outer plastic jacket. When such a cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes optical connectors (male and/or female designs) at each end, it is generally referred to as an optical jumper cord. A bend-limiting boot <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is positioned at the junction between the relatively rigid connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the flexible optical cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to preclude sharp bends in the optical fiber that cause transmission loss. In this example embodiment, the cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a glass fiber that extends through the connector and is held within a ferrule <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which is a cylindrical member having a small bore that extends axially between opposite ends thereof. The glass fiber, whose diameter is typically 125 microns, is adhesively held within the bore. It is the end face of this glass (or plastic) optical fiber that the dust cap <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is designed to protect. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Dust cap <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises a box-like housing having a front end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a back end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and side walls that define a cavity <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. An opening into the cavity <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is located at the back end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the housing and is shaped to receive the optical plug <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. A tubular member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is located within the cavity at the front end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the housing to receive the ferrule <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and protect it from adverse environmental conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> disclose various details regarding the construction of the dust cap <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The tubular member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is shown to be cylindrical in these figures because it accommodates a known LC plug with a cylindrical ferrule. Nevertheless, optical ferrules having one or more rows of optical fibers are known and the tubular member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be shaped to accommodate any optical ferrule cross section. Moreover, connectors are known (see U. S. Pat. 5,923,805) for plastic optical fiber(s) that do not use a ferrule because the diameter of the plastic fiber large enough to be self supporting. It is, therefore, understood that the dust cap of the present invention can be used with optical plugs containing large-diameter plastic optical fibers that are not contained within a ferrule. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The tubular member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> comprises a tubular structure, preferably cylindrical, having a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> that is parallel to the direction of insertion of an optical plug <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) into the dust cap <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The tubular member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has a distal end <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that is closed to prevent dust and debris from entering, and a proximal end <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> that is opened and shaped to receive a ferrule <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the proximal end <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> includes a chamfer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that is shaped to facilitate insertion of the ferrule into the tubular member. Significantly, the proximal end <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the tubular member is recessed within the cavity <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by a distance &ldquo;d&rdquo; from the back end <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the dust cap. This is to assure that the optical plug <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) will be well aligned with the dust cap before the ferrule <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> enters the tubular member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>&mdash;thereby preventing the forward end of the ferrule from contacting the proximal end <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the tubular member during insertion. The proximal end forms a reverse trap, which reduces the possibility of dust reaching the end face of the ferrule where the optical fiber is exposed. It is noted that the forward end of the ferrule protrudes from the front end of the optical plug by about two millimeters. For a tight fit between the optical plug and the cavity <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the dust cap, a distance &ldquo;d&rdquo; of slightly more than two millimeters (mm) would be adequate. However, it is desirable for the dust cap to fall away from the optical plug easily when the latching arm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is deflected, so a tight fit is undesirable. Accordingly, distance &ldquo;d&rdquo; needs to be greater than two (2) millimeters to accommodate a looser fit between the optical plug and the dust cap. Preferably, distance &ldquo;d&rdquo; is greater than three (3) mm and, in the illustrative embodiment of the invention, it is seven (7) mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, tubular member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> attaches to the front end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the dust cap approximately midway between the distal <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and proximal <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> ends of the tubular member. Nevertheless, it is understood that the tubular member may be attached to the front end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the dust cap at other locations along the length of the tubular member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An optical plug connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) interlocks with the dust cap <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> via shoulders <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that latch behind a pair of retaining features <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which are molded into the dust cap. The shoulders <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are located on the latching arm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the optical plug connector. During the molding of the dust cap <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the retaining features <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed by overlapping cores so that no slides are required in the mold. The interlocking cooperation between the shoulder <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the retaining feature <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is shown most clearly in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, which shows a partial cross-section view of an optical jumper installed in the dust cap <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the optical jumper comprises a length of optical cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> that terminates in an optical plug connector <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. A bend-limiting boot <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is disposed at the junction between the optical cable and the optical plug connector in order to limit the minimum bending radius of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> that is contained within the cable at this junction. Illustratively, the optical fiber <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is made from glass and typically has an outer diameter of 125 microns. An end portion of the optical fiber is supported within a bore that extends between opposite ends of a cylindrical ferrule <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which is typically made from a ceramic material such as zirconia. The ferrule <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is held within an end portion of a support member <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> that is held within a connector housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A latching arm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> includes a pair of shoulders <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (only one is shown) on opposite sides the interlock with retaining surfaces <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (only one is shown) that are molded into the dust cap. The dust cap is released by depressing the latching arm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> downward&mdash;an operation that is aided by a cantilever trigger <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which slidably engages the latching arm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> when it is depressed. The trigger <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> not only prevents snagging of the connector when the cable is pulled backward through a concentrated area of cables and wires (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,638,474), but also improves user access to the latching arm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the ferrule <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and particularly its end face where the optical fiber itself is exposed, resides within the tubular member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and is thereby protected from dust, debris and abrasion during handling. Desirably, the inner diameter of the tubular member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is slightly larger than the outer diameter of the ferrule <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In this illustrative embodiment of the invention, the inner diameter of the tubular member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is about 1.8 mm while the outer diameter of the ferrule <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is about 1.25 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Although various particular embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, modifications are possible within the scope of the invention. For example, it is understood that the dust cap of the present invention may be used with optical plugs that contain plastic optical fiber with or without a ferrule, and that the tubular member need not be cylindrical. </paragraph>
