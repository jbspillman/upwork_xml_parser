<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention generally relates to a bicycle shift control device. More specifically, the present invention relates a cable operated bicycle shift control device that has an access opening for accessing the interior of the bicycle shift control device to perform maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Bicycling is becoming an increasingly more popular form of recreation as well as a means of transportation. Moreover, bicycling has become a very popular competitive sport for both amateurs and professionals. Whether the bicycle is used for recreation, transportation or competition, the bicycle industry is constantly improving the various components of the bicycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For example, the front and rear shift control devices are often redesigned to make them easier to operate and easier to maintain. The shift control devices are coupled to a drive train having several gears, which are used on a bicycle in order to climb hills more easily, or to ride faster on flat ground. The shift control devices are each generally coupled to a shift mechanism such as a derailleur or an internally geared hub that is operated by a control cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There are many types of cable operated shift control devices currently being installed on bicycles. For example, some cable operated shift control devices have a pair of shift levers and a cable winding mechanism that rotates via a ratchet mechanism. With conventional cable operated shift control devices of this type, operation of one of the shift lever causes the cable winder to rotate via the ratchet mechanism in one direction by one gear. As a result, the cable is wound around the cable winder, and a shift is made by the shift mechanism from one gear to the next gear. Operation of the other shift lever causes the ratchet mechanism to be released and the cable winder to rotate in the other direction by one gear. As a result, the cable that was wound on the cable winder is played out, and a shift is made in the opposite direction by the shift mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another example of a cable operated shift control device is a hand grip actuated shifter in which the hand grip rotates around the axis of the handlebar to rotate a cable take-up element. Thus, when the hand grip is rotated in one direction, the cable is wound around the take-up element to cause the derailleur or internal geared hub to shift from one gear to the next gear. Rotation of the hand grip in the other direction causes the cable to be unwound or played out so that the derailleur or internal geared hub shifts from one gear to the next gear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One problem with these types of cable operated shift control devices is that the control cable sometimes breaks. Many of these shift control device have to be completely disassembled in order to replace the control cable. More recently, a maintenance hole has been provided for changing these control cables. These maintenance holes can allow dirt or other contaminants to enter the unit. Therefore, many control devices with maintenance holes have a plug for covering the hole. These plugs are typically separate parts that are prone to being lost. Moreover, often these plugs are difficult to remove without a tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In view of the above, there exists a need for an improved bicycle shift control device which overcomes the above mentioned problems in the prior art. This invention addresses this need in the prior art as well as other needs, which will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a conventional bicycle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is illustrated having a shift control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> coupled to the handlebar <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the bicycle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Bicycles and their various components are well known in the prior art, and thus, the bicycle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and its various components will not be discussed or illustrated in detail herein, except for the components that relate to the present invention. In other words, only the shift control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the components that relate thereto will be discussed and/or illustrated herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, as best seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the shift control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is part of an integrated shifting and braking unit. In other words, the shift control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fixedly coupled to a lever bracket <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that pivotally supports a brake lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Of course, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that the shift control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> could be a separate unit from the brake lever <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Moreover, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that this invention could be utilized with other types of shift control devices such as a hand grip actuated shift control device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The shift control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> basically includes an outer casing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> having a cable operated winding mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> disposed in the outer casing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a pair of shift levers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and a gear indicator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> operatively coupled to the cable operated winding mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The cable operated winding mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the gear indicator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are well known in the art. Thus, these parts will not be discussed or illustrated in detail herein. Moreover, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that the precise structure of these parts is not crucial to the present invention. The illustrated embodiments of the cable operated winding mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the gear indicator <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,701,786, assigned to Shimano Inc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the outer casing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is formed of four portions, i.e., a first or upper casing half <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a second or lower casing half <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> having a first lower casing portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>a second lower casing portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and a third lower casing portion <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>The lower casing portions <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are fastened to the upper casing half <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by a bolt <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> extending through the outer casing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a nut <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> attached to an upper portion of the upper casing half <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The upper casing half <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is integrally formed with the lever bracket <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the upper and lower casing halves <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are coupled together, the entire outer casing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected to the handlebar <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through the mounting portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>a of the lever bracket <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The shifting levers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the cable operated winding mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are attached to a support member <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that is mounted within the outer casing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> via the bolt <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the nut <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The shifting levers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are interlocked to the cable operated winding mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through a take-up element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and a known ratchet-type interlock mechanism. This interlock mechanism includes a ratchet type feed pawl (not shown) for transmitting a pivotal movement of a shift lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to the take-up element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, a positioning pawl (not shown) for returning the take-up element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in a predetermined rotational position, a limiter pawl (not shown) for limiting an unwinding rotation of the take-up element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and a release cam (not shown) for disengaging the positioning pawl from the take-up element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> By operating the shift levers <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the take-up element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is rotated to pull or release an inner wire <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the control cable <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. For example, when the shift lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is shifted in an upshift direction U from an original position N<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the take-up element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> rotates in a winding direction to take up the inner wire <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the control cable <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The shift lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be released after being operated a predetermined amount necessary for effecting a gear change. Then, the shift lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> automatically returns to the original position under the biasing force of a return spring (not shown). At this time, despite the return to the original position of the shift lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the take-up element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is retained in a position to which the take-up element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> has been rotated by the shift lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to complete the gear change. The shift lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is shiftable in a downshift direction D from an original position N<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, the shift lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> can be released to be returned to its original position by the biasing force of a return spring (not shown). Then, the take-up element <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> rotates by an angle of one pitch in the unwinding direction under the force of an unwind spring (not shown) and a restoring force of the shifting device (derailleur) provided by the inner wire <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the shift control device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> unwinds the inner wire <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the control cable <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to effect a one-stage gear shift. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the outer casing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a cable receiving bore <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and an access opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> formed between the upper casing half <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the lower casing half <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as well as a pair of shift lever openings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> formed therebetween. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the upper casing half <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the lower casing half <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> each includes curved L-shaped rails <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that are vertically spaced apart to form a curved channel for slideably receiving a maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The rails are located so that the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can slide between closed position overlying the access opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and an open position exposing the access opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The rails <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are also provided with a stop <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> at one end to limit the movement of the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As best seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> an <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is a generally curved member having a curvature that conforms to the curvature of the outer surface of the outer casing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Preferably, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has a pair of guide edges <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that are received between the rails <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the upper and lower casing halves <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for slideably being received within the channel formed therebetween. As best seen in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> an <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of ribs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that form a handle element, which is arranged to aid in moving the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> between the closed and open positions. The ribs <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>that form the handle element are located at one end of the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The other or opposite end of the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is provided with a latching or locking arrangement that releasably locks the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the closed position as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In particular, the outer casing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> include complementary retaining elements. Preferably, the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has a recess or notch <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>that forms a first complementary retaining element while the outer casing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a second complementary retaining element in the form of a latching element or portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. This latching element <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be a protrusion or merely edge portion of a part of the outer casing <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Thus, the notch <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>engages the latching portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the upper and lower casings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to lock the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the closed position. In particular, when the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is moved from the open position to the closed position, the end of the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> with the notch <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>will slide underneath the latching portion <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the upper and lower casing halves <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to releasably lock the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the closed position. Preferably, this locking arrangement is accomplished by having the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> being flexed slightly inwardly towards the access opening <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> such that the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is elastically deformed. This results in the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> applying an outwardly directing force on the latches to hold the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in the closed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that the upper and lower casings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the maintenance cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be constructed of a variety of materials. These materials include various plastics and metals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The terms of degree such as &ldquo;substantially&rdquo;, &ldquo;about&rdquo; and &ldquo;approximately&rdquo; as used herein mean a reasonable amount of deviation of the modified term such that the end result is not significantly changed. These terms should be construed as including a deviation of at least &plusmn;5% of the modified term if this deviation would not negate the meaning of the word it modifies. </paragraph>
