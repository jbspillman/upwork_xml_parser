<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a keyboard, such as a computer keyboard, and in particular to a pushbutton structure of a keyboard which generates a pulse-like reaction when it is depressed for indicating the depression thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A computer keyboard includes a plurality of pushbuttons each comprising a cap accessible and depressible by a user. A conventional design of the pushbutton comprises a post, which may be hollow, extending from the cap. The post is partially received and is axially movable within a guiding bore. To ensure proper movement of the cap, the post must have a size large enough to reduce the risk of being jammed in the guiding bore. This, however, is contrary to the current trend of miniaturization in the electronic and computer industries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Pushbuttons having caps supported by a pair of links pivotally connected to each other in a cross form are also known. This structure effectively reduces the space required by a pushbutton. A rubber member is positioned under the cap. The depression of the cap collapses the rubber member. The resiliency of the rubber member restores the cap back to its original un-depressed position. Such a restoration force provided by the rubber member, however, is generally not sufficient to effectively return the cap back to the un-depressed position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the rubber member only offers a very limited reaction during the depression of the pushbutton. This may sometimes be ignored by the user when the user is depressing the pushbutton and thus making no clear indication of the depression of the pushbutton to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is thus desirable to provide a pushbutton structure which overcomes the above problems. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a pushbutton structure which generates a pulse-like reaction during depression of the pushbutton for providing a clear indication of the depression of the pushbutton. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a pushbutton structure having a strong restoring force for returning the pushbutton from a depressed position to a released position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> To achieve the above objects, in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a pushbutton structure of a keyboard comprising a cap supported on a base board by a linkage comprising first and second links pivoted together whereby the cap is movable from a released to a depressed positions when depressed. Each link has upper and lower pivots respectively connected to the cap and the base board. The links have two side bars connected between the upper and lower pivots thereof Two spring arms extend from the base board having free ends forming L-shaped offset sections receivingly engaging L-shaped recesses defined in corresponding side bars for biasing the cap toward the released position. The spring arms deform when the cap is depressed. When the spring arms are deformed to an extent, the offset sections are abruptly driven toward and impact a contact surface of the recesses, generating a sound of impact and a pulse-like reaction caused by the impact. The deformation of the spring arms helps returning the cap back to the released position when the depression is released.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> With reference to the drawings and in particular to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a pushbutton constructed in accordance with the present invention, generally designated with reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is shown. The pushbutton <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a linkage (not labeled) consisting of first and second links <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> supporting a cap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on a base board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The base board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> forms a pair of spaced and substantially parallel tabs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> perpendicularly extending from the base board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The tabs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> define aligned holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for rotatably retaining pivot pins <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the first link <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). The base board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> also forms a pair of spaced spring arms <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> each having a free end comprising an offset section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> forming an L-shape for engaging a corresponding recess <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> defined in the first link <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A tab <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed on the base board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> forming a slot for rotatably receiving and retaining a pivot pin <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the second link <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the first link <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a U-shaped member (not labeled) comprising a first pivot pin <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and two first side bars <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> extending from opposite ends of the first pivot pin <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The first pivot pin <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is rotatably received and retained in first pivot retaining members <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> formed on an underside (not labeled) of the cap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment illustrated, each first pivot retaining member <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> defines a cavity (not labeled) for receiving a corresponding end of the first pivot pin <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The first side bars <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> define aligned holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Preferably the holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are formed on substantially centers of the first side bars <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the first link <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as shown in the drawings. Free ends of the first side bars <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> form axially aligned second pivot pins <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> rotataby received and retained in the holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the tabs <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the base board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Each first side bar <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> has a lateral protruding portion (not labeled) defining a recess <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> forming an L-shaped configuration having a contact surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The offset section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the corresponding spring arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the base board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is movably received and engaged by the recess <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for biasing and/or returning the linkage toward a released position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The second link <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a rectangular frame (not labeled) having a third pivot pin <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a fourth pivot pin <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and two second side bars <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> connected between the third and fourth pivot pins <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Opposite free ends of the third pivot pin <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are rotatably received and retained in second pivot retaining means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> formed on the underside of the cap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment illustrated, the pivot retaining means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> comprises two spaced resilient projections (not labeled) defining a space therebetween for accommodating each free end of the third pivot pin <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The fourth pivot pin <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is rotatably received and retained in the slot formed by the tab <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the base board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Two axially aligned fifth pins <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> transversely extend, in opposite directions, from the second side bars <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> for being rotatably received and retained in the holes <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> whereby the first and second links <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are pivotally connected to each other, forming a cross configuration. Due to the pivotal connection between the links <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the links <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are allowed to move from the released position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3</cross-reference>A), wherein the links <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are resiliently supported by the spring arms <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the base board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, to a depressed position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 4</cross-reference>A when the pushbutton <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is depressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> To assemble, the second link <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a width substantially equal to or smaller than a distance between the first side bars <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the first link <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> whereby the second link <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be accommodated between the first side bars <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the first link <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The fifth pins <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the second link <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are rotatably received in the hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the first link <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> forming the pivotal connection between the links <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The first pivot pin <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the first link <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is positioned into the first pivot retaining members <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the cap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The second pivot pins <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the first link <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are fit into holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of the base board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The fourth pivot pin <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the second link <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is placed into the slot <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> formed on the base board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the ends of the third pivot pin <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are fit into the second pivot retaining means <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the cap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. This mounts both the linkage (links <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) and the cap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the base board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The offset sections <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the spring arms <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the base board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> receivingly engage the recesses <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> defined in the first side bars <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of the first link <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> thereby resiliently supporting the linkage and the cap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the released position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> When the pushbutton is actuated by depressing the cap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the links <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> collapse toward the base board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> against the spring arms <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, allowing the cap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to move toward the base board <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The movement of the cap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> causes an electrical contact to change from an OFF condition to an ON condition as is similar to the conventional pushbuttons. No further detail of the contact will be given herein for it is known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> During the depression of the cap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the spring arms <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are deformed (deflected) and spring energy is stored therein whereby when the pushbutton <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is released, the stored energy drives the spring arms <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> back to their un-deformed condition thereby moving the cap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> back to the released position when the depression of the pushbutton is released. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, when the linkage is in the released position, an edge of the recess <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> engages a sloped portion (not label) which connects the offset section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to the spring arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the offset section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> being spaced from the contact surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the recess <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, when the cap <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is depressed to such an extent that the spring force of the spring arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is greater than the friction between the recess <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the sloped portion <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of the spring arm <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, the offset section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is abruptly moved toward and impacts the contact surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the recess <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A sound is generated. A pulse-like reaction is also generated when the offset section <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> impacts the contact surface <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiment thereof, it is apparent to those skilled in the art that a variety of modifications and changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention which is intended to be defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
