<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A folding rule includes a first stick having a first hole with a plurality of first protrusions located radially around the first hole. A second stick has a second hole with a plurality of second protrusions located radially around the second hole. A rivet has a resilient member mounted thereto and extends through the first hole and the second hole. The first protrusions are engaged with grooves defined between the second protrusions. The resilient member is compressed so as to disengage the first protrusions on the first stick from the grooves in the second stick. By this way, the first stick is pivoted relative to the second stick. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a folding rule wherein each stick has a plurality of protrusions and grooves are defined between the protrusions. The protrusions on a first stick are engaged with the grooves in a second stick. A resilient member is connected between the overlapped portion of the two sticks. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A conventional folding rule generally includes a plurality of sticks and each stick has marks on a surface thereof. The sticks are pivotally connected with each other by rivets connecting overlap portions of two sticks so that the stick can be pivoted relative to the other. The folding rule can be used to measure peripheral length of an angled object by contacting the sticks on the sides of the angled of the object. However, the sticks are not easily be maintain their portions when the two sticks are opened at an angle. In other words, the sticks could be moved to change the desired angle between the two sticks and the user has to re-arrange the two sticks again. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a folding rule which comprises a first stick having a first hole defined therethrough and a plurality of first protrusions extend from a surface of the first stick and are located radially around the first hole. A plurality of first grooves are defined between the first protrusions. A second stick has a second hole defined therethrough and a plurality of second protrusions <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>&prime; extend from a surface of the second stick. The second protrusions are located radially around the second hole and a plurality of second grooves are defined between the second protrusions. A rivet has a resilient member mounted thereto and extends through the first hole and the second hole. The first protrusions are engaged with the second grooves and the second protrusions are engaged with the first grooves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The primary object of the present invention is to provide a folding rule wherein the two sticks can be positioned at several angles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention will become more obvious from the following description when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings which show, for purposes of illustration only, a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the folding rule of the present invention comprises a first stick <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a first hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> defined therethrough and a plurality of first protrusions <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> extend from a surface of the first stick <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The first protrusions <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> are located radially around the first hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a plurality of first grooves <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> are defined between the first protrusions <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. A second stick <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a second hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> defined therethrough and a plurality of second protrusions <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>&prime; extend from a surface of the second stick <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The second protrusions <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>&prime; are located radially around the second hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a plurality of second grooves <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>&prime; are defined between the second protrusions <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>&prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the first stick <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a recess <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> defined in the other surface which is located in opposite side of the surface having the first protrusions <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, and the recess <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> communicates with the first hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The second stick <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a recess <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> defined in the other surface which is located in opposite side of the surface having the second protrusions <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>&prime;, and the recess <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> communicates with the second hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A rivet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a flange <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and a shank extending from the flange <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. A resilient member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is mounted to the shank which extends through the first hole <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the second hole <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and is machined to have an other flange received in the recess <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The resilient member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is located between the first flange <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and an inside of the recess <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The first protrusions <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> are engaged with the second grooves <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>&prime; and the second protrusions <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>&prime; are engaged with the first grooves <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. When pulling the second stick <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> away from the first stick <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the resilient member <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is compressed and the first protrusions <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> contact head to head the second protrusions <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>&prime; as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when pivoting the first stick <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the first protrusions <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> are engaged with the second grooves <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>&prime; at another angle. Therefore, the two sticks <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be positioned at different angles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> While we have shown and described the embodiment in accordance with the present invention, it should be clear to those skilled in the art that further embodiments may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
