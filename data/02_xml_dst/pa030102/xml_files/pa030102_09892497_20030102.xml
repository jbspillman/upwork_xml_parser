<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The present invention relates to a keyboard with a direction controller, the direction controller setting on a proper position on the keyboard. In the keyboard, there is a sensor close to the direction controller to detect the direction and movement of the controller and then convert the direction and movement of the controller into the changing of the position of the cursor on the screen. So that, the keyboard has the mouse&apos;s operation function on position movement. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a keyboard with a direction controller, particularly a direction controller that is set to a proper position of the keyboard, to control the movement of the curser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventional keyboards are an I/O device for used to input data into files. Since windows have been widely used in personal computers, so every computer has had a mouse to control the movement of the curser. There is a kind of mouse with a rolling ball on the bottom. Through moving the mouse deriving a relative movement of the rolling ball, the curse is controlled on the screen. Another one is with a rolling wheel (axle) implemented the center of the mouse. The curse movement is controlled through the rolling wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Obviously, mouse and keyboards are individual devices. In practical operation, it is necessary to move the hand from the keyboard to the mouse, and even to reach the mouse and the curser&apos;s position. Therefore, the operation speed will be decreased significantly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, most modern keyboard designs focus on multimedia keyboard designs. It means that adding extra keys on the keyboards makes the application on the Internet and MP3 feasible. Nevertheless, nobody has designed a curser controller on a keyboard, so a keyboard with a direction controller has been designed to make the keyboard more practical. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The main objective of the invention is to provide a keyboard with a direction controller setting on a proper position on the keyboard. In the keyboard, there is a sensor close to the direction controller to find the direction of the controller, transfer into the changing of the position of the curser on the screen, and make the keyboard has the mouse&apos;s operation function on position movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The direction controller could be a rolling axis or a stick device, which can manipulate the movement of curse or screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> To describe the structure and technology content more detailed, a practical example is listed below illustrating with figures. However, the example listed below is to illustrate the invention, not to restrict it. The replacement or rectification for all the relevant elements still belongs to the scope of this invention.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTED EXAMPLE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the keyboard <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> with direction controller of the invention comprises a direction controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which is located at a proper position of the keyboard <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, such as the top right of the keyboard <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), or up left (not shown), or other proper position. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the direction controller is a rolling axis. The rolling axis has a shaft through the center of the rolling wheel which makes the rolling wheel can be turned. Within the keyboard, implementing a sensor (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) close to the rolling wheel which can detect the direction and the movement of the rolling wheel. The direction and the movement is converted to the displacement in order to control movement of the cursor. Therefore, the keyboard is combined with the function of the mouse movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The direction controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of vertical axis (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) can manipulate the vertical movement. In addition, it can also be a horizontal axis to manipulate the horizontal movement (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in this invention, the direction controller <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be a stick-type controller. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the stick <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can manipulate the vertical and horizontal movement to drive the curser or screen&apos;s movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> After the direction controller moves to a position, the position can be set by using another control key. And the control key can be designed locating in the positioning-device to act the positioning function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> For the sensor mentioned in the invention and the device and control circuit to convert the direction controller displacement to curser movement are known to people who are familiar with this field, and not the feature of this invention, so no further description will be presented in this specification. </paragraph>
