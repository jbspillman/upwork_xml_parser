<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention concerns the administration of printing devices in a network environment. In particular, the invention concerns the creation and management of print queues corresponding to printing devices connected on a network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Incorporation by Reference </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/664,531, entitled &ldquo;Object-Based Architecture For Supporting Network Devices,&rdquo; filed Sep. 18, 2000, is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth in full herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 3. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The administration of printing devices in a network environment is typically a tedious and time consuming task for network administrators. In particular, for large and complex network environments having several local servers, there may be a large number of printers distributed throughout the network. Network administrators must not only install new printing devices on the network, they must also create and manage the print queues associated with the printing devices and facilitate network users connecting to and utilizing the printing devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In large computer networking environments, the administrative tasks required to create and configure print queues associated with printing devices connected to the network can be demanding. For example, when creating a print queue for a printing device, a network administrator generally must manually enter information such as the address assigned to the printing device, the particular type of printing device, and the configuration or capabilities of the printing device. As the number of printing devices increases, the time and effort required to obtain the needed information and create and configure the necessary print queues can become excessively burdensome. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Once a print queue has been created and configured for a particular printing device, network users may begin utilizing the printing device by locating and connecting to the desired print queue, and installing any necessary print drivers. However, searching for the desired print queue often requires the network user to search lists of print queues on multiple network servers. In networking environments employing a large number of servers, finding a desired print queue can be confusing and very time consuming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As printing devices within an existing computer network are relocated or reassigned addresses, typically a network administrator must update the configuration stored for the respective print queues to reflect any change of address on the network. Additionally, if the name of a print queue is changed, all user workstations using that particular print queue must be updated with the new name or the user workstations will lose their connection to the printing device. As the size of the computer network increases, updating print queue configuration information and ensuring all workstations have updated print queue names becomes very time consuming. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention addresses the foregoing problems by providing for the automatic creation and configuration of print queues upon detecting printing devices on a network. Specifically, the invention detects new printing devices connected on a network. Upon detection of a printing device, information is obtained from the detected printing device and a print queue is created. Accordingly, the present invention helps reduce the burden of manually creating and configuring print queues for connected printing devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the invention concerns detecting a printing device connected on a network and requesting information from the detected printing device. The requested information is received from the printing device and a print queue is created for the printing device based on the received information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The invention preferably includes detecting a printing device by detecting an address assignment message sent between an address server and the printing device over the network. The invention also includes detecting the printing device by sending a request message to a plurality of network addresses and receiving a response message from the printing device located at one of the network addresses. Additionally, the invention includes detecting a printing device by broadcasting a request message over a network and receiving a response message from the printing device connected on the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The invention also preferably includes publishing the newly created print queue to the network. Additionally, it is preferable to create a print queue entry in a print queue configuration database that includes configuration data related to the print queue. Preferably a web page is created containing links representing each of the print queues with entries in the print queue configuration database. By selecting a link on the web page, a user can preferably configure a workstation to print to the print queue represented by the link. It is also preferable to detect a new IP address of one of the printing devices and update both the configuration of the print queue corresponding to the printing device and the configuration data in the print queue entry of the configuration database corresponding to the printing device. Finally, it is preferable to detect new identification information of a print queue and update a connection between a network workstation and the print queue to reflect the new identification information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> By virtue of the foregoing, print queues are created and configured upon detection of a printing device. In addition, changes in printing device addresses or print queue identification information are updated in the corresponding print queue configurations, and network workstations are notified of the changes. Accordingly, tedious and time consuming tasks involved in the management of network printing devices are reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> This brief summary has been provided so that the nature of the invention may be understood quickly. A more complete understanding of the invention can be obtained by reference to the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment in connection with the attached drawings.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a block diagram for explaining one of device management directories <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the device management directory is utilized for containing identification and network configuration information with respect to each printing device detected and discovered by the present invention. In particular, device management directory <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> contains a plurality of entries <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, each entry corresponding to a particular printing device which has been detected and discovered by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Based on information discovered by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the respective device, a separate entry is created for the printing device and identification information related to the printing device, along with network configuration information of the printing device, is stored in the entry. For example, each of entries <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> has a field for entering the MAC address <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> of the corresponding printing device. In addition, each entry has a corresponding print device type <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and IP address <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> for the printing device associated with the entry. Lastly, network configuration information <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> contains network-related information associated with the printing device for the respective entry, such as domain name and other network setting information. In this manner, a directory is provided for maintaining identification information and network configuration information of each printing device managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for efficient access and management by a network user, such as a system administrator. When more than one network management device is present across network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, other device management directories are created to provide a common location for maintaining identity and network configuration information for all printing devices managed by all network management devices on the network. This functionality is discussed in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a block diagram for explaining print queue configuration directory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. In particular, print queue configuration directory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> contains a plurality of entries corresponding to each print queue which is created by the present invention for each printing device which is detected and discovered. When a print queue is created for a printing device, the configuration information related to the print queue is stored in an entry in print queue configuration directory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to maintain all print queue configuration information in a common location. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, each entry in print queue configuration directory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> corresponds to a separate print queue and contains information fields for IP address <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, MAC address <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, print queue name <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, printing capabilities <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> and server <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. IP address <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> contains the IP address of the printing device corresponding to the print queue entry and MAC address <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> also corresponds to the MAC address for the printing device. Print queue name <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is a name which is detected by discovery from the corresponding printing device or, if it is not detected, a name is generated when the print queue is created. For example, print queue name <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may comprise a name which is simply the make and model of the printing device which is discovered by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the printing device. In a similar fashion, printing capabilities <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> contains printing capabilities of the printing device associated with the print queue entry. For example, printing capabilities <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> can include, but is not limited to, color printing capabilities, recording sheet-size capability such as letter and/or A<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and resolution capabilities. Server <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is the identity of the network management device which is maintaining the print queue for a given printing device. For example, in a network environment having multiple network management devices, different print queues may be distributed among the multiple network management devices in order to balance the processing throughput and memory load required to maintain the print queues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a block diagram for explaining the functionality of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the network environment of network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is provided in network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for supporting DHCP communications over network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using the DHCP protocol. In particular, DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> can be enabled, such as by a system administrator through front panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, to respond to all DHCP address requests on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for an IP address. In this configuration, DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> supports a software hook to which discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has preregistered. When DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> receives a DHCP address request from a device on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> responds to the requesting device with an assigned IP address. When DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> receives an address acknowledgment message from the requesting device, DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> uses the software hook to notify discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the assignment of an IP address to the requesting device. Discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can then determine if the requesting device is the type of network device that discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> should perform discovery on, and if so, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> sends a discovery request message to the device to obtain information regarding the device&apos;s network settings, as well as device capabilities and configuration. A predetermined range of MAC addresses can be used by discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to determine whether a device detected by DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is one for which discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> should perform discovery. In addition, a predetermined MAC address range may also be used by DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> so that DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> will only provide assigned IP addresses to a preferred set of network devices, such as network printers. Preferably, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> compares the MAC address of the address acknowledgment message to the predetermined MAC address range to determine if the device is a network printer that should be discovered and managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the alternative, network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can also be configured to disable DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>, such as by a system administrator either through front panel <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> or through network configuration web page <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. For example, when an external DHCP module is used DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is disabled to prevent addressing conflicts and discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> conducts classic discovery to discover all printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Such classic discovery of the printing devices can include, but is not limited to, known techniques such as using broadcast discovery messages, pinging through a list of IP addresses, router table walking, and DNS lookup. For example, an SNMP broadcast discovery message can be sent and then discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can send a targeted SNMP discovery request to each responding printing device. In the alternative, discovery module can ping through a list of IP addresses and then send a targeted SNMP discovery request to each responding printing device. As another alternative, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can obtain router tables from the routers on the network and then send an SNMP discovery request to each printing device having an IP address in the routing tables. Lastly, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can obtain a list of assigned IP addresses from a DNS server on the network and then send an SNMP discovery request to each printing device having an IP address in the list. It can be appreciated that other known methods of discovery can be used by discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> to discover printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when an external DHCP server is used instead of DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> in network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In addition to classic discovery methods, DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be used to detect an IP address acknowledgment message for a new requesting printing device on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In particular, DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> detects DHCP address acknowledgment messages which contain an IP address for a new printing device on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, after boot-up of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the configuration where an external DHCP server is utilized, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> uses classic discovery methods as discussed above to discover the printing devices existing on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> After using such classic discovery, DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can then be used to detect printing devices which subsequently become operational on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by detecting the IP address acknowledgment message sent from the DHCP server to the newly incorporated printing device to the external DHCP server. In this manner, DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be used to augment classic discovery in order to supplement the list of discovered printing devices after initial boot-up of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> also uses a software hook, to which discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has preregistered, to notify discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> when a newly incorporated printing device has been detected. Discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> then initiates a discovery process for obtaining information from the newly incorporated printing device, as discussed in more detail below. DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can also use a MAC address range in order to listen only for IP address acknowledgment messages corresponding to a particular class of network devices, such as network printers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, when an external DHCP server is used, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> uses classic discovery methods to discover printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, after which DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be used to discover subsequently incorporated printing devices. On the other hand, when DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is utilized, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is notified through the software hook from DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> of a detected printing device. Regardless of the manner in which discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> becomes aware of a detected printing device, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> initiates discovery of information from the printing device. Preferably, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> sends an SNMP information request to the detected printing device by using the IP address of the detected printing device. The detected printing device then responds with an SNMP information message to provide the requested information to discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> creates an entry for each discovered printing device in device management directory <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, the entry corresponding to each discovered device in device management directory <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes the IP address, MAC address, printing device type and network configuration information corresponding to printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> also notifies print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> of each discovered printing device so that print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> can create a new print queue for the printing device and place the new print queue in print queues <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. Print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> also creates an entry in print queue configuration directory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> which contains identification information for the printer, such as IP address, MAC address and printing device type, as well as a print queue name and printing device capabilities. In this manner, the network configuration of printing devices is easily managed and print queues are efficiently created and maintained for the detected printing devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Although the block diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> shows that network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is only using one of network interfaces <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> for connecting to network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, another configuration is supported by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in which one of the network interfaces is used to connect to another network, such as a local network on which only printing devices reside. In such an environment, DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> can be configured to respond only to IP address requests from printing devices on the second local network, thereby leaving DHCP server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to respond to all other IP address requests on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this manner, printing devices can be physically isolated from all other network devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to prevent unauthorized use and managed use of the printing devices connected to the second local network through network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The functionality of this embodiment is discussed in more detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> As also seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, web server <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> allows web pages such as those described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, to be published over the network to network users, such as a user at workstation <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or a network administrator at server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Lastly, function application modules <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> can provide network-wide functional capabilities for the printing devices managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and interface with virtual device containers <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> for supporting such network applications on behalf of printing devices managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, functional application modules <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may include a secure printing application which allows users on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to provide print jobs to printing devices managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a secure fashion. Even though the printing devices do not have the embedded functionality for supporting secure printing, virtual device containers <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> act on behalf of their respective printing devices to support such functionality. In this manner, network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is an extendable management tool for efficiently managing printing devices on a network whereby additional functionality can be added depending on the needs of the particular network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In addition, network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can control a network device which it manages, such as a network printer, so as to reconfigure the network device for efficient operation under the management of network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For example, if a network printer is connected to network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> over the local network, then network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can use SNMP messages to reconfigure the network printer. Such reconfiguration of the network printer can include, but is not limited to, instructions for the network printer to stop supporting certain protocols and to only use the protocol which network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> uses to communicate with the network printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is a flowchart depicting a process performed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to create print queues corresponding to network printing devices discovered on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, discovery of network printing devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is coordinated through discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1001</bold></highlight>, the discovery process is initiated when discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is activated by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> determines if network devices connected to network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> have been detected and assigned IP addresses prior to discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> becoming active. Checking for previously detected network devices may occur in different ways depending on the manner in which discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is being notified about newly detected network printing devices. For example, if DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is active and assigning new IP addresses to requesting network devices, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> will query DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> for all network printing devices that have been assigned IP addresses prior to discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> becoming active. On the other hand, if DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is not active and an external DHCP server, such as DHCP server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, is being utilized to assign IP addresses to requesting network devices, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> utilizes classic discovery methods (as discussed above) to detect existing network devices. Accordingly, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> can identify all network devices connected to the network and assigned IP address prior to discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> becoming active. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> If there are no existing network devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> when discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is initialized, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> waits for notification of a new device in step S<highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight>. Notification received by discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may be limited to network devices with specific IP addresses or specific MAC addresses in order to limit which network devices on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be supported by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. For this embodiment, we are assuming that discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> will only be notified of newly discovered printing devices. Notification of a new device may come in different ways as described earlier. For example, a software hook within DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> will notify discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of a new network device when an address acknowledgment message is received by DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> from a network device that requested an IP address. In the alternative, when an external DHCP server is being used, DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will listen on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for an address acknowledgment message from a network device requesting an address from an external DHCP server and notify discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of any such network device. Regardless of the manner in which discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is notified of a new printing device, the notification includes sufficient identification information of that printing device to allow discovery module to communicate with the printing device. Such information might include, but is not limited to, the IP address and the MAC address of the newly detected printing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> If discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> has been notified of a new printing device, or in step S<highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> an existing printing device has been found, the print queue creation process proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight> where discovery module <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> obtains additional information from the printing device. For purposes of this description, assume that printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is a newly detected printing device. In step S<highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight>, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> sends an information request message to printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> via SNMP agent <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> using the IP address provided in the notification. In response to the request message, printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> sends a response which includes information including, but not limited to, the type and model of printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as well as information regarding the available functions and capabilities of printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The information might also include available paper sizes, color capabilities, print speed, resolution, etc. As discussed above, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> uses this information received from printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to create an entry in device management directory <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Additionally, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> forwards this information to print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> so that print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> can use the information in the creation of a print queue corresponding to printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight>, print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> creates a print queue corresponding to printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and configures the print queue using the information, such as the addresses, printer type, configuration and capabilities, obtained from printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> via SNMP agent <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> by discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The created print queue is named according to a set of predetermined rules set up by a network administrator. For example, the print queue may be named according to the make, model, IP address or other attributes (or combination of attributes) of the corresponding printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Additionally, a print queue name may be obtained from printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the information obtained by discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Once configured, the newly created print queue is stored within print queues <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, a print queue can be created and configured automatically for a newly detected network printing device (or a previously detected printing device) without requiring a network administrator to manually enter the configuration information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In addition to creating a print queue to be associated with printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> creates a print queue entry in print queue configuration directory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, print queue configuration directory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> contains a plurality of entries corresponding to print queues created and configured by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> thereby providing a common location for print queue configuration information for all existing print queues on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, each entry in print queue configuration directory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> contains fields for IP address, MAC address, print queue name, printing capabilities and the server managing the print queue. The fields for each entry are completed by print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> using the information used in creating and configuring the particular print queue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> As mentioned earlier, print server <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> is a print server for managing the print queues of one or more printing devices managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Once a print queue is created and configured by print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight>, the print queue is registered with print server <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. Print server <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> then proceeds to publish and make the print queue available to client workstations connected to network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> using conventional protocols such as SMB. In addition, print server <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> may utilize print queue policy rules <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> to regulate use of the print queues by client workstations connected to network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> maintains print queue web page <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, which is stored within web pages <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, using the print queue entries in print queue configuration directory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, print queue web page <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is a web page accessible to users of network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in which all available print queues managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and any other network management devices connected on network <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are published in a single location. Web server <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is used to publish print queue web page <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> over network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing a network user to access the listing of available print queues using either a workstation, like workstation <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, or a server, like server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> depicts a process for configuring a client workstation to utilize a print queue corresponding to one of the network printers, such as printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight>, print queue web page <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is opened at workstation <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using user interface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> and a conventional browser installed on host processor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Viewing print queue web page <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, a network user at workstation <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can search a single listing of all available print queues on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and select a particular print queue. Using user interface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, a network user may select a desired print queue. Selection may be performed by typing in the print queue name within user interface <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> or by selecting a link associated with the desired print queue within print queue web <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> page using a pointing device such as a mouse. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receives the selection from the available print queues made by the user at workstation <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> then searches print drivers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for the appropriate print driver associated with the selected print queue. In step S<highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight>, Network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> configures the client workstation by sending and installing the appropriate print driver from print drivers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on workstation <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Once the print driver is installed on workstation <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, in step S<highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight> network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> establishes a connection between workstation <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and print server <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing print jobs to be sent from workstation <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the selected print queue. The present invention is not limited to the method described above for configuring a client workstation. For example, the network and the client workstations may utilize an operating system and printing protocol which do not utilize print drivers, such as a UNIX based system. In that case, network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> would execute the necessary functions in step S<highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> to make it possible for the requesting client workstation to establish a connection in step S<highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In the course of managing a computer network, network devices may need to be relocated or replaced. When a device is relocated, it may need to have a new IP address assigned to it for communication within the network. In addition, when dynamic hosting protocols such as DHCP are used to administer IP addresses, situations may arise where a network device is assigned a new IP address. If a network printing device is assigned a new IP address, it is essential that the print queue associated with that printing device is updated with the new IP address in order to maintain consistency for the client workstations connected to that particular print queue for printing purposes. The flowchart depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> demonstrates a process for automating the task of updating print queue configurations with new IP addresses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, either by DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> or by DHCP listening module <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> detects the assignment of IP addresses to network devices and notifies discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. For the purposes of this example, assume printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has been relocated on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is assigned a new IP address by DHCP server <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight>, the assignment of an IP address to printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is detected. In step S<highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>, discovery module <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is notified that printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has been assigned a new IP address, and discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is provided with the IP address assigned to printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the MAC address of printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Upon receiving notification that printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has been assigned an IP address, in step S<highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight> discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> compares the MAC address of printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with those listed in the entries of device management directory <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Since printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> was previously connected to network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, an entry is found under the MAC address of printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> together with its previous IP address. Using the pair of address (IP and. MAC) from the entry, print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> can identify a previously created print queue associated with printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by referring to print queue configuration directory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. Once the print queue is identified, the process proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1205</bold></highlight>, discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> instructs print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> to update the configuration of the print queue in print queues <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> associated with printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so that the IP address reflects the newly assigned IP address. In addition, in step S<highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight>, print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> updates the IP address entry for the print queue in print queue configuration directory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to reflect the new IP address of printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, all network users with connections to the print queue associated with printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will be able to maintain their connections without interruption due to the IP address change. Additionally, the network administrator is not required to manually change the configuration or entry in print queue configuration directory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The process described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is an expansion of the process described in step S<highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. In the event that no match is found by discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> in step S<highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight>, the detected network device has not been previously detected (or at least not within a predetermined time frame). The process then proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight> within <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> and a print queue is created according to the process described there. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In addition to print queue web page <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> also maintains queue service page <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, which allows users, preferably network administrators, to access and manage the print queues associated with printing devices managed by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and any other network management devices connected to network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Web server <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> publishes queue service page <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing a user to access the page from a server, such as server <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, using user interface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Queue service web page <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> provides a user with many functions. For example, using queue service web page <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, a user can perform queue management functions including, but not limited to, manually creating or removing print queues, pausing and resuming the operation of a print queue, purging a print queue, and editing the driver associated with a print queue. In addition, queue service web page <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> allows a user to manage individual print jobs within individual print queues. For example, a print job may be paused, restarted, cancelled or reordered. Accordingly, queue service page <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> affords a user a large amount of control over print queues associated with the printing devices of network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, queue service web page <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> allows a user to manage existing print queues on network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Using queue service web page <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, an administrator may rename the queue associated with printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> using queue service web page <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. However, if the name of a print queue is changed, all network devices, such as workstation <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, that use that particular print queue, will no longer have a connection with printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Each network device with a connection to printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> must learn the new print queue name of the print queue associated with printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and the configuration on each network device must be modified to reflect the new print queue name. Additionally, a network administrator may reassign a particular print queue to a different server during network administration or to provide for load balancing. As with changing the name of a print queue, all network devices with a connection to printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> must have their connection updated to reflect the new server in order to continue to use printer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> corresponding to the particular print queue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a flowchart depicting a process for updating print queue connections when the identification information of a print queue has been changed. For example, the name of a print queue may be changed to provide for easier identification of a particular print queue. Additionally, a print queue may be moved to a different server by a network administrator while organizing the network or to facilitate load balancing among multiple printers available on the network. Regardless of the type of change, when the identification information of a print queue is modified, client workstations on the network will no longer be able to send print jobs to the modified print queue until their connections have been updated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight>, the identification information of a print queue within print queues <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is modified either by a network administrator or another process operating on network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>, print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> compares the identification information of the modified print queue with the entry in print queue configuration directory <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> corresponding to the modified print queue, and modifies the entry to reflect the changes made to the particular print queue. In step S<highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight>, print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> identifies client workstations connected to network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which are configured to utilize the modified print queue by querying print server <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. Finally, in step S<highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight>, the connection between a client workstation identified in step S<highlight><bold>1304</bold></highlight> and the modified print queue is updated to reflect the new identification information of the print queue. Accordingly, client workstations connected to network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can continue to use print queues within print queues <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> regardless of any modifications made to print queue identification information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The procedure for updating a print queue connection, described with reference to step S<highlight><bold>1305</bold></highlight> above, may vary depending on the network configuration or the protocol used for communicating between the client workstation and the printer. For example, when a print queue is modified, network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may simply notify software installed on the identified client workstation of the new identification information using a protocol such as SNMP. The software would then update the configuration on the client workstation. Alternatively, the client workstation may allow remote configuration thereby allowing a network administrator or a module within network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to remotely configure the client workstation with the new identification information of the print queue. Other embodiments may utilize other protocols such as LPD, providing a level of indirection and allowing the connection configuration to be updated within the print server. Regardless of the updating method being used, the present invention maintains the connection between a client workstation and a print queue without requiring action from a network user of the client workstation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, using queue service web page <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, an administrator can manually create a print queue for a network printing device. While the present invention can automatically detect a new printing device and create a print queue for that printing device, situations may arise where manual creation of print queues is required. For example, the auto-create feature of the invention may be disabled by an administrator via queue service web page <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Additionally, an administrator may designate a maximum number of printing devices or may designate an IP address (or MAC address) range of printing devices to be supported by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> using queue service web page <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Upon being notified of a new printing device by discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> will not proceed with the automatic creation of a print queue when the existing number of print queues being supported by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has reached a maximum number set by a network administrator or if the IP address (or MAC address) falls outside of a predetermined range. If an administrator wishes to add another print queue under these situations, as well as others, manual creation of the print queue must be performed using queue service web page <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> depicts a process for manually creating a print queue for a network printing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In step S<highlight><bold>1401</bold></highlight>, a user, preferably a network administrator, selects manual print queue creation using queue service web page <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Queue service web page <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> then provides an interface for the user to create and configure a print queue for a particular network printing device. In step S<highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight>, the user is given the option of creating a print queue for either a previously discovered printing device or new printing device. If the user selects creating a print queue for a new printing device, the user then provides identification information about the printing device in step S<highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to contact the printing device over network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to obtain additional information from the printing device. The provided identification information includes, but is not limited to, the IP address of the printing device as well as the type of printing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> If the user opts to create a print queue for a previously detected printing device in step S<highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight>, the user is provided with a list of current printing devices. The list is generated by referring to device management directory <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which as described above, contains an entry for each network device detected by network management device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The user then selects from the list of current printing devices in step S<highlight><bold>1405</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the list from which the user selects a printing device could be generated by discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> performing one of the classic discovery methods discussed earlier to compile a current list of network devices. Once discovery had been completed by discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, the list would then be generated and displayed for the user to select from. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> After the user has entered identification information for the printing device in step S<highlight><bold>1404</bold></highlight>, or selected a current printing device in step S<highlight><bold>1405</bold></highlight>, the process proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>1406</bold></highlight> where the parameters required for configuring the new print queue are obtained. Discovery module <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> obtains additional information from the printing device using a service such as SNMP agent <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> as described above regarding step S<highlight><bold>1005</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Additionally, the user is prompted for information needed to establish other properties of the print queue such as load balancing, fail over printing, automatic share reconfiguration, etc. Once all the necessary information has been obtained from the printing device and the user, print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> is provided with the obtained information and instructed to create a print queue in step S<highlight><bold>1408</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>1408</bold></highlight>, Print queue service module <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> creates a print queue in the manner described above regarding step S<highlight><bold>1008</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described with particular illustrative embodiments. It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments and the various changes and modifications may be made by those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
