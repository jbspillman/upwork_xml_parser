<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A depth adjusting system for a screw gun comprises a base supported on the screw gun, an on/off collar removably attached to the base, and an adjusting collar and a depth locator mounted to the on/off collar. The adjusting collar rotates but cannot move axially relative to the on/off collar. Rotation of the adjusting collar causes the depth locator to move axially relative to the on/off collar for adjusting the depth setting. An indexing system is provided between the adjusting collar and the on/off collar for retaining the angular position of the adjusting collar and the depth setting. The on/off collar can be easily attached and detached from the base with a simple axial force applied to the on/off collar. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The field of this invention is depth adjusting systems for power tools. More particularly the field is depth adjusting systems for screw guns in which part of the system is easily removable from the screw gun to gain access to the spindle and screwdriving bit, and the system retains its depth setting when it is replaced on the screw gun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,647,260 to O&apos;Hara et al. and 5,341,704 to Klemm disclose depth adjusting systems for screw guns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The O&apos;Hara et al. patent discloses a two piece depth adjusting system comprising an adjustment collar (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) and a depth locator (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>). The adjustment collar releasably attaches to the nose portion (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) of the screw gun. The depth locator (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) engages the adjustment collar (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) through a screw thread arrangement. When attached to the nose portion (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>), the adjustment collar (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) is rotated to adjust the axial position of the depth locator (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>). The depth locator (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) is prevented from rotating relative to the nose portion (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) so that when the adjustment collar (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) rotates, the depth locator (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) is in turn driven axially through the screw thread arrangement. Indexing means are also provided between the nose portion (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) and the adjusting collar (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) to retain the adjusting collar (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) in a predetermined angular position relative to the nose portion (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>) and thus also retain the depth setting of the depth locator (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>). However, when the adjusting collar (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) is removed from the nose portion (<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>), the indexing means no longer retains the angular position of the adjusting collar (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>). When a user removes the adjusting collar (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) and the depth locator (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) to, for example, change the screwdriving bit, the depth setting may be lost and will have to be reset when the adjusting collar (<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>) and depth locator (<highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>) are replaced on the screw gun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The Klemm patent discloses a two piece depth adjusting system comprising a sleeve (<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) and a depth locator (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>). The sleeve (<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>) is releasably attached to the gear case of the tool. A groove (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) on the gear case holds a resilient split retaining ring (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). A flange (<highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>) on the sleeve (<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>) engages and moves over the retaining ring (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>) with an audible snap when sleeve (<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>) is attached to the gear case. The sleeve (<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>) may be detached by pulling it axially away from the gear case. In the commercial embodiment of the Klemm patent, the force required to detach the sleeve (<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>) varies and is sometimes excessive when the flange (<highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>) &ldquo;hangs up&rdquo; on the retaining ring (<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Once attached, the sleeve (<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>) does not rotate or move axially relative to the tool. The depth locator (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) engages the sleeve (<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>) through a screw thread arrangement. Rotation of the depth locator (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) by the user causes the depth locator (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) to be driven axially by the screw thread arrangement to adjust the depth setting. An indexing means between the sleeve (<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>) and the depth locator (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) retains the angular position of the depth locator (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) relative to the sleeve (<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>) and thus maintains the depth setting. Although the indexing means functions regardless of whether the sleeve (<highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>) is attached to the gear case, in order to adjust the depth locator (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>), the user must manually turn the depth locator (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) itself. This can be awkward because the radius of the depth locator (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) is relatively small so that turning the locator (<highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>) is not ergonomically comfortable. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to overcome these and other drawbacks found in the prior art depth adjusting systems and to provide additional advantageous features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a depth adjusting system for removably attaching to a base of a tool comprises an on/off collar removably attachable to the base so that the on/off collar is not rotatable relative to the base when it is attached thereto, an adjusting collar mounted to the on/off collar and being rotatably but not axially moveable relative to the on/off collar, and a depth locator mounted to the on/off collar and being rotatably and axially moveable relative to the on/off collar such that the depth locator moves axially in response to relative rotation between the depth locator and the on/off collar. The depth setting of the depth adjusting system can be adjusted by rotating the adjusting collar which in turn drives the depth locator to rotate in unison, such rotation causing axial movement of the depth locator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a depth adjusting system for a screw gun comprises a spindle extending from the screw gun and adapted to receive a screwdriving bit mounted on one end of the spindle for driving a screw into a workpiece, and a removable depth adjusting assembly removably attached to the screw gun. The removable depth adjusting assembly has a central opening therethrough at least partially surrounding the spindle, the opening defining an axis parallel to the rotational axis of the spindle. The removable depth adjusting assembly comprises an adjusting collar rotatably but not axially moveable relative to the screw gun when the removable depth adjusting assembly is releasably mounted to the screw gun, a depth locator operatively associated with the adjusting collar wherein the depth locator moves axially to adjust a depth setting responsive to rotation of the adjusting collar relative to the screw gun, and an indexing means for releasably retaining the adjusting collar in its selected angular position regardless of whether the removable depth adjusting assembly is attached to the screw gun. The indexing means can be overcome to rotate the adjusting collar by a deliberate torque applied to the adjusting collar by a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a depth adjusting system for a tool comprises a base having receiving means, and a removable depth adjusting assembly removably attached to the base. The removable depth adjusting assembly comprises a depth locator whose axial position relative to the base is adjustable while the removable depth stop is attached to the base, and a first collar connected to the depth locator having at least two tabs projecting therefrom which engage with the receiving means when the removable depth adjusting assembly is attached to the base. The tabs have rounded profiles wherein an axial force applied to the collar can engage and disengage the tabs with the receiving means. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a method for adjusting the depth setting of a depth adjusting system for a screw gun, the method comprises the steps of: rotating an adjustment collar and prohibiting the axial movement of the adjustment collar, causing a depth locator to rotate in response to the rotation of the adjustment collar, and causing the depth locator to move axially in response to its rotational movement, the axial movement of the depth locator effecting an adjustment of the depth setting. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The depth adjusting system of the present invention is especially useful in screw guns with a depth sensitive clutch to control the depth to which the head of a screw will be driven into a work piece. The depth adjusting system will be described in relation to its use in this preferred context. However, the depth adjusting system is not limited to use with a screw gun and may also find use in other tools. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Screw guns with depth sensitive clutches are well known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,655,103 and 4,947,714). A co-pending application assigned to the same assignee as this application also discloses a depth sensitive clutch and its operation in detail. This co-pending application no. 09/______ is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into to this specification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the depth adjusting system comprises a base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, an on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, an adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, and a depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. As will be described in further detail herein, the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is mounted to the housing <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of the screw gun. The on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, and depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> remain assembled one to another during normal use and will be referred to herein as the removable depth adjusting assembly A, or simply removable assembly A. The removable depth adjusting assembly A is releasably attached to the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The removable assembly A has a central opening therethrough and partially encloses a spindle <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and screwdriving bit <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. The spindle <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and screwdriving bit <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> rotate to drive a screw into a work piece. When a wear surface <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> on the forward end of the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> contacts the work piece, the depth sensitive clutch begins to disengage and the driving of the screw will stop upon complete disengagement. Thus, the axial position of the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> determines the depth to which the screw will be driven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A simple axial force applied to the removable depth adjusting assembly A in the direction of its longitudinal axis will reliably attach and detach it from base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The longitudinal axis of the removable depth adjusting assembly A is coaxial with, or at least parallel with, the axis of rotation of the spindle <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> and the screwdriving bit <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is attached to the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, it is prevented from rotating. (In this application, when it is stated that one part does not move relative to another part, this means that the parts may still experience slight relative motion due to design and manufacturing tolerances.) The adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can be rotated but cannot be moved axially relative to the screw gun. Rotation of the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> by the user causes the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to rotate in unison. The depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> moves axially relative to the screw gun to adjust the depth setting of the depth adjusting system in response to relative rotation between the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the screw gun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An indexing means retains the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> in its angular position, thus also retaining the axial position of the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the depth setting of the depth adjusting system. Advantageously, the indexing means retains the depth setting even when the removable assembly A is not attached to the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 8</cross-reference>, the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is mounted to the housing <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> of the screw gun and provides an attachment structure for releasably attaching the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to the screw gun. In a preferred embodiment, the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has threads <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) formed on an end thereof which engage with complementary threads <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>) formed on the housing. Other mounting systems may also be used. When the depth adjusting system is used with a screw gun having a depth sensitive clutch, the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may enclose a portion of the clutch assembly and even cooperate with support structure, such as bearings or seals, for the clutch assembly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In such a situation, it is advantageous to removably mount the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the housing <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> with a system such as threads <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> which permit the user to remove the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from the housing <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> when it is desired, for example, to service the clutch components. Base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has gripping elements <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> formed around an exterior periphery to help remove base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from housing <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The threads <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> should also reliably prevent the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from coming loose from the housing <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> during normal use. Other mounting systems for mounting the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the housing <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> may also be used and will be within the scope of the invention. Also, if it is unnecessary for the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to be removable, the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be integrally formed with the housing <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> as part of a unitary component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is removably attachable to the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and thus through association the entire removable depth adjusting assembly A is removably attachable to the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Removably attachable and removably attached mean that the when the removable assembly A is attached to the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, it resists detachment with a retention force, and the retention force can be easily overcome or released by the user to purposefully detach the removable assembly A. A feature of one embodiment is that the removable assembly A can be simply and reliably attached and detached from the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by applying an axial force on the removable assembly A toward or away from the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> To this end, the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be provided with resilient hinges <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, each with rounded tab portions <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> projecting inwardly from the surface thereof toward the longitudinal axis of the removable assembly A. The resilient hinges <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may flex radially outwardly or inwardly from the longitudinal axis of the assembly A. The base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may have receiving means for receiving the tab portions <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. The receiving means may be a circumferential groove <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, or a circumferential array of detents for receiving the tab portions <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> therein, or any other appropriate structure for receiving the tab portions <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, when the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is being attached to the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the resilient hinges <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> must flex outwardly while the tab portions <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> slide over a larger diameter portion of base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and into the groove <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Because the resilient hinges <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> must flex outwardly before the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be removed from the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and due to the rounded profile of tab portions <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, a retention force is created resisting detachment of the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. However, also due to the rounded profile of tab portions <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, the retention force can be overcome by a deliberate axial pulling force from the user to detach the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Other arrangements for releasably attaching the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be used. For example, a retaining ring may be provided on one of the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and an internal flange on the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Or the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be provided with complementary threads. However, the arrangement illustrated herein is preferred because the pulling force necessary to detach the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is more reliably consistent than with a retaining ring design. Due partly to their rounded profile, tab portions <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> do not &ldquo;hang up&rdquo; on the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as a flange may do on a retaining ring. Also, the resilient hinges <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and groove <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be sized so that the resilient hinges <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are biased outwardly and the tab portions <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> are constantly exerting an inward force on the groove <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> when the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is attached to the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. This positive engagement tends to prevent the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from feeling &ldquo;loose&rdquo; or &ldquo;sloppy&rdquo; when it is mounted on the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> When the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is mounted to the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, it is prevented from rotating relative to the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, in a preferred embodiment base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has detents <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> radially evenly spaced around the circumference of at least a portion thereof. The on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has locking tabs <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> radially evenly spaced around at least a portion of an internal surface thereof. Locking tabs <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> align with and engage at least some of the detents <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> when the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is mounted to the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The locking tabs <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and detents <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> have an approximately semi-cylindrical cross-section in the illustrated embodiment, but any appropriate shape could be used. In the illustrated embodiment, eight detents <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are provided so that there are eight positions in which the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can removably attach onto the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. This advantageously reduces the need to hunt for the correct orientation when attaching the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Other methods of preventing the relative rotation of the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is mounted to the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in such a way that relative rotation causes the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to move axially away from or toward the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to adjust the depth setting. With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</cross-reference>, in a preferred embodiment threads <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> are formed on an interior portion of the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and complementary threads <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> are formed on an exterior portion of the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. This arrangement is advantageous because rotating the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> relative to the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> causes a relatively small amount of axial movement, dependent upon the pitch of the threads <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>. Thus, fine adjusting of the depth setting is possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is rotatably mounted to the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, but is not axially moveable relative to the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. With reference again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</cross-reference>, in a preferred embodiment adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be provided with resilient hinges <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, each with locking tabs <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> projecting inwardly from the surface thereof toward the longitudinal axis of the removable assembly A. The resilient hinges <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are flexible radially outwardly or inwardly from the longitudinal axis of the assembly A. A circumferential groove <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may be formed on the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for receiving the locking tabs <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> therein. When the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is being mounted to the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the resilient hinges <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> must flex outwardly while the locking tabs <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> slide over a large diameter portion of the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and then snap into groove <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. Locking tabs <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> each have a locking surface <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> formed at a right angle to the longitudinal axis of the removable assembly A, and the sides of groove <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are also formed at a right angle to the longitudinal axis of the removable assembly A. Due to this construction, once the locking tabs <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> snap into groove <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, they cannot easily be removed so that the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is held axially relative to the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (but is free to rotate). Alternatively, the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be detachably mounted to the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, if desired. Other systems for preventing axial movement but allowing rotational movement of the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> relative to the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be used within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> engages the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> so that they rotate in unison. With reference again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</cross-reference>, in a preferred embodiment the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has at least one driving key <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> extending radially inwardly from the surface thereof. The depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> has at least one elongated slot <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> formed on the exterior thereof. When the adjustment assembly A is assembled, the driving key <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is received in the slot <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. When the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is rotated (and the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> remains stationary), the driving key <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> pushes against the side of the slot <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and drives the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to rotate in unison. When the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> rotates relative to the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> it moves axially relative to the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Slot <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is elongated to allow the driving key <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> to move from end-to-end in the slot <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. Other systems for allowing relative axial movement but for preventing relative rotational movement between the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may be used, as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> An indexing means may be provided to retain the depth setting of the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The purpose of the indexing means is to prevent the accidental loss of the depth setting. The indexing means will be overcome if the user purposefully adjusts the depth setting. In a preferred embodiment, the indexing means is provided between the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and retains the angular setting of the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> relative to the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, even when the adjusting assembly A is not mounted to the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The indexing means may alternatively be provided between the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The indexing means could even conceivably be located between the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, in which case the indexing means would retain the axial position of the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> relative to the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in a preferred embodiment the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may have detents <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> radially evenly spaced on an interior surface thereof. The on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may have resilient indexing tabs <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> radially formed on an exterior surface thereof which engage with the detents <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> when the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is mounted to the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. When the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is rotated relative to the on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the resilient indexing tabs <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> must flex in order to move in and out of the radially spaced detents <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> as the rotation occurs. The force required to flex the indexing tabs <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is provided by torque applied to the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Thus, the retaining action of the indexing means is overcome when the user applies a torque to the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> great enough to flex the indexing tabs <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and rotate the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Other forms of indexing means may be used. For example, any structure which restricts the movement of one part relative to another part unless a minimum force is applied to flex a portion of one of the parts is one type of indexing means and may be used within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> It would be possible to encompass the major features of the invention in a depth adjusting system which lacks a separate on/off collar <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Such a depth adjusting system would comprise merely an adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The adjusting collar would be releasably attached to the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in a manner permitting rotational movement but preventing axial movement relative thereto through, e.g., hinge portions and rounded tab portions engaging a circumferential groove in the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> would engage with the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in a manner permitting axial movement, but preventing rotational movement relative thereto. The indexing means would in this case be constructed between the adjusting collar <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and the depth locator <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
