<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to the field of image sharing. Particularly, aspects of this invention pertain to location-based image sharing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. General Background and Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> People love to share photos. No more is this principle more evident than in the new age of digital photos whether these digital photos are made by traditional film cameras and then converted into digital photos by, for example, a scanner or made with a digital camera, and irrespective of the format (JPEG, BMP, TIF, etc.) of these digital photo files. Digital photos are now sent as e-mail attachments, posted on Web sites, shared over instant messaging networks and on and on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Sharing digital photos by e-mail is relatively simple. Most e-mail software applications provide the means to attach or embed digital photo files into an e-mail for display and/or saving by the recipient. The sender then simply sends the e-mail including the digital photo(s) to one or more desired recipients. In many circumstances, senders may establish one or more groups of recipients, e.g. members of a family or acquaintances and send a digital photo via e-mail to the group by identifying the group in the address of the e-mail. Sending such digital photo files by instant messaging networks is also easy since most, if not all, instant messaging software provides for sending and receiving computer files including digital photo files. As with e-mail, the sender identifies one or more recipients and sends the digital photo files to them. A sender can also identify a group of recipients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Sharing digital photos through the Web can often be more complicated and involve interesting variations. In a typical scenario, the one or more digital photos are uploaded/downloaded to a Web site server by a user. The digital photos are integrated into the Web site and made available through the Web site server for browsing/downloading. These Web sites offer varying levels of security and control over who may add, delete, view and access the digital photos. Further, the user can configure the presentation of the one or more digital photos such as by enhancing (with, for example, captions or decorative backgrounds), laying out and categorizing the digital photos. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Many such Web sites also offer a user the ability to send an e-mail to one or more recipients containing a hyperlink to the one or more digital photos to be shared with those recipients. By clicking on the hyperlink in most conventional e-mail software applications, a recipient can be quickly directed to all or some of the digital photos on the Web site through the recipient&apos;s browser. In some cases, the recipient may need to provide authorization information to gain access to the digital photo(s) because the user may not wish to provide open access or wants to selectively present different digital photos to different users. Another variation on this theme involves sending not a link but the actual digital photo itself to the one or more recipients. In this manner, the user does not need to attach or embed the digital photo into an e-mail; the user simply needs to identify recipients (and typically their e-mail addresses) to the Web site and the Web site software generates and sends e-mails including the digital photo(s) to the intended recipients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> People also often enjoy sharing videos such as videos of the family trip or a newborn. Just like digital photos, this sharing principle is no more evident than in the new age of digital videos whether these videos are made by traditional video cameras and then converted into digital videos or made with a digital video camera, and irrespective of the format (MPEG, AVI, etc.) of these digital videos. As with digital photos, digital videos are now sent as e-mail attachments, posted on Web sites whether for discrete download or for streaming, shared over instant messaging networks and on and on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> However, other than simply e-mailing or instant messaging digital photos/videos or links to digital photos/videos on a Web site to recipients whether individually or to one or more groups of recipients, there have not been many, if any, new and different sharing schemes for digital photos/videos. There is a need in the art for an improved solution to sharing images such as digital photos and/or videos. It is advantageous to provide a method and system for location-based image sharing.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment, a method for location-based image sharing is provided. A sharing rule is provided. The sharing rule defines with which one or more recipients images are shared based on location-identifying information. Location-identifying information associated with an image is provided to the sharing rule to determine the one or more recipients with which the image should be shared. There is also provided, in another embodiment, a system for location-based image sharing. Again, a sharing rule defines with which one or more recipients images are shared based on location-identifying information. A sharing engine applies location-identifying information associated with an image to the sharing rule to determine the one or more recipients with which the image should be shared. Furthermore, in another embodiment, there is provided a computer program product including computer program code to cause a microprocessor to perform a method for location-based image sharing. The method comprises providing a sharing rule defining with which one or more recipients images are shared based on location-identifying information, and applying location-identifying information associated with an image to the sharing rule to determine the one or more recipients with which the image should be shared. In another embodiment, a computer program product is provided. The program product includes computer program code, which when executed, causes a microprocessor to perform a method of sharing an image based on location-identifying information associated with it. The method includes determining a recipient of the image based upon the location-identifying information, and making the image available to the recipient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a camera <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is used to obtain an image <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with which location-identifying information <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> is associated whether automatically or manually. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, a camera could be of various types including a traditional film camera, a digital photo camera, a traditional video camera, a digital video camera, etc. and the resulting image could be a digital photo and/or video or a traditional photo and/or video which is converted into a digital format (although as should be apparent to those in the art the image could be in any format provided it is capable of transmission over networks). The location-identifying information also can be of various types such as latitude/longitude coordinates provided by a global positioning system (GPS) included in or interoperating with the camera, manual location-identifying information associated with the image by the user in the camera or in a computer system into which the image is loaded, radio frequency identification (RFID) information provided by a RFID system included in or interoperating with the camera (e.g. a camera capable of reading RFID tags that are used to mark locations such as beacons), or any other location-identifying information associated with an image whether automatically or manually. The location-identifying information may also be associated with the image before, contemporaneously with, or after the image is taken and may be associated with the image in the camera or elsewhere such as on a computer system. Indeed, the image may be further processed by, for example, changing format, before or after the location-identifying information is associated with the image. In an example application of the invention, a digital camera generates a digital photo file that includes electronic latitude/longitude coordinates generated by a GPS, connected to the camera, at the time the digital photo is taken. As used herein, associating the location-identifying information with an image may instead or in addition be including the location-identifying information in the image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Once an image with location-identifying information is obtained <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the location-identifying information may need to be converted to or associated <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> with location data such as a traditional location name, street address(es), special name(s) (e.g. &ldquo;John&apos;s house&rdquo;), etc. for application to one or more sharing rules (discussed hereafter). In an embodiment, the latitude/longitude location-identifying information of the image is used in conjunction with a location database <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to convert those latitude/longitude coordinates into a traditional location name. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the example latitude/longitude coordinates of 47.606&deg; N, 122.277&deg; W are converted to the location name of &ldquo;Seattle, Wash.&rdquo; <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> through a simple look-up via the location database. Similarly, other location-identifying information could be associated with or converted to relevant location data. However, a location database is not required from time to time or at all if the location-identifying information is sufficient for use with the sharing rule(s) or if no location database is implemented <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The location data may also be associated manually by a user, for example, where the location database does not provide information for converting or associating the location-identifying information with location data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The location-identifying information, whether in its original form or in the form of relevant location data, is then applied <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> to one or more sharing rules <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, if any are applicable <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, to determine to which one or more recipients an image should be made available. For example, a sharing rule may define that all images taken in Seattle, Wash. should be shared with a particular recipient (e.g. James) or group(s) of recipients. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, location-identifying information in the form of location data Seattle, Wash. is applied to two sharing rules, namely &ldquo;Share Seattle, Wash. images with James&rdquo; and &ldquo;Share John&apos;s house images with John.&rdquo; Since the location-identifying information only satisfies one of those two sharing rules, namely &ldquo;Share Seattle, Wash. images with John&rdquo;, the image related to the location-identifying information is only made available to John (subject to any other rules or conditions as discussed below). The location-identifying information may also be useful for addition to a location database, if implemented i.e. Seattle, Wash. may have been identified manually and the location-identifying information along with the manually identified location data may be added to a location database for use with an implemented location-identifying information conversion feature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, any number of conditions, whether location based or not, could be implemented into a sharing rule e.g. sharing only images taken between dates X and Y, sharing only video images, etc. A sharing rule could also, for example, specify a set of location-identifying information (e.g. images taken in Seattle and Tacoma, Wash.), specify a proximity to an item of location-identifying information or to a set of location-identifying information (e.g. images taken within 5 miles of Seattle, Wash.), or specify a bounding perimeter of location-identifying information (e.g. images taken within the area bounded by Seattle, Tacoma and Olympia, Wash.), whether in place of or in combination with specifying particular location-identifying information such as a traditional location name or a particular set of latitude/longitude coordinates. Additionally, other rules (including sharing rules) may be combined with one or more sharing rules to affect the results of the application of the sharing rule(s). For example, a rule may specify that images should only be shared with persons on a buddy list. As a result, the buddy list rule operating in conjunction with previous or subsequent sharing rules (or other rules) acts as a filter to limit the persons to whom images will be shared notwithstanding that the sharing rule(s) may allow for sharing of an image to a person not on the buddy list. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> If one or more sharing rules are satisfied and one or more recipients are determined from the application of location-identifying information to the sharing (and other, if any) rule(s) <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, the image pertaining to the location-identifying information is made available to each of the recipients specified by the complied with sharing (and other, if any) rule(s) <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment, sending information for the recipient(s) e.g. e-mail addresses is determined and then the image, along with perhaps other images determined to be sent to the recipient, is sent electronically by e-mail to each of the recipient(s) specified by complied with sharing rules and for which sending information is available. Such sending of e-mails may be automatic (in that the e-mail is generated and sent to the recipient(s) without significant or any user intervention) or manual and optionally, the user may be offered the choice to decline sending the image to one or more of the determined recipients. Alternatively, a link to the image on a Web site could be sent instead of the image itself. The image (or link) could also be sent by other electronic transmission means such as instant messaging. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the image may also simply be made available on a portion of a Web site designated for the recipient and which the recipient may access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The image is captured in or loaded into a computer system that comprises a user computer that is preferably connected to a network of computers including computers of recipients and is processed by the computer system according to the sharing functionality described herein. The term computer here is considered in its broadest sense as some device with computing capabilities such as traditional personal computers, cellular phones, handheld computers (PDAs), and even cameras themselves. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, all the computing functionality described above may be incorporated into the camera itself and a connection to a network is simply made by a phone line or other network connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> schematic of the hardware and software architecture of an embodiment and application of the invention is presented. In the embodiment, the above-described sharing functionality is implemented as a software program <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> for operation on a computer system <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The computer system itself comprises one or more connections to a network of computers <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> including computers of recipients and connected to the computer system is a digital camera <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, having GPS capabilities, to capture and provide the image, along with related location-identifying information, to the computer system. All such connections may be wired or wireless. The software program receives the image along with the related location-identifying information from the digital camera via the computer system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Once the image is received, the location-identifying information is processed by the sharing engine <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> of the software through an associated location database <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> to determine a traditional location name or other relevant location data. The sharing engine then applies the sharing rules <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>, configured in the software program by a user, to the image and related location-identifying information (whether in its original form and/or as a traditional location name or other relevant location data) to determine intended recipients. The e-mail addresses of intended recipients, if any, are retrieved from a database of e-mail addresses <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> maintained for intended recipients (such a database could be specially made in the software, could be an address book from an e-mail application and/or could be a software contact organizer). Then, for each intended recipient resulting from the successful application of one or more sharing rules, e-mails with the image attached are created within and sent by an associated sending unit <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> such as an e-mail application using the retrieved e-mail addresses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, a great number of variations to the above-described hardware and software architecture are possible and within the scope of the invention. For example, any or all the various software components described (such as the sharing engine, the sending unit, etc.) can be integrated into one program, further divided into components or differently packaged together. The location database could be integrated into the software program. The sharing engine may be divided into a location database component and a sharing rule processing component. The e-mail address database may be a part of the e-mail application. A further variation is that camera need not be the exclusive or actual source of the image or be involved with associating the location-identifying information with the image. Optionally, the image could be received by the program from the network via e-mail, the Internet, etc. Also, the location-identifying information may be associated with the image inside the software program instead of or in addition to by the camera. Furthermore, the specific software and hardware architecture described above should not be considered limiting of the invention because, for example, the software and hardware could be completely integrated into one system or differently arranged and/or some or all of the software functionality could be implemented as hardware or vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The detailed descriptions may have been presented in terms of program procedures executed on a computer or network of computers. These procedural descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the art to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. The embodiments of the invention may be implemented as apparent to those skilled in the art in hardware or software, or any combination thereof. The actual software code or hardware used to implement the invention is not limiting of the invention. Thus, the operation and behavior of the embodiments often will be described without specific reference to the actual software code or hardware components. The absence of such specific references is feasible because it is clearly understood that artisans of ordinary skill would be able to design software and hardware to implement the embodiments of the invention based on the description herein with only a reasonable effort and without undue experimentation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A procedure is here, and generally, conceived to be a self-consistent sequence of operations leading to a desired result. These operations comprise physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually, though not necessarily, these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored, transferred, combined, compared, and otherwise manipulated. It proves convenient at times, principally for reasons of common usage, to refer to these signals as bits, values, elements, symbols, characters, terms, numbers, objects, attributes or the like. It should be noted, however, that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Further, the manipulations performed are often referred to in terms, such as adding or comparing, which are commonly associated with mental operations performed by a human operator. No such capability of a human operator is necessary, or desirable in most cases, in any of the operations of the invention described herein; the operations are machine operations. Useful machines for performing the operations of the invention include general-purpose digital computers, special purpose computers or similar devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Each operation of the method may be executed on any general computer, such as a mainframe computer, personal computer or the like and pursuant to one or more, or a part of one or more, program modules or objects generated from any programming language, such as C&plus;&plus;, Java, Fortran, etc. And still further, each operation, or a file, module, object or the like implementing each operation, may be executed by special purpose hardware or a circuit module designed for that purpose. For example, the invention may be implemented as a firmware program loaded into non-volatile storage or a software program loaded from or into a data storage medium as machine-readable code, such code being instructions executable by an array of logic elements such as a microprocessor or other digital signal processing unit. Any data handled in such processing or created as a result of such processing can be stored in any memory as is conventional in the art. By way of example, such data may be stored in a temporary memory, such as in the RAM of a given computer system or subsystem. In addition, or in the alternative, such data may be stored in longer-term storage devices, for example, magnetic disks, rewritable optical disks, and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the case of diagrams depicted herein, they are provided by way of example. There may be variations to these diagrams or the operations described herein without departing from the spirit of the invention. For instance, in certain cases, the operations may be performed in differing order, or operations may be added, deleted or modified. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the invention may be implemented as an article of manufacture comprising a computer usable medium having computer readable program code means therein for executing the method operations of the invention, a program storage device readable by a machine, tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by a machine to perform the method operations of the invention, or a computer program product. Such an article of manufacture, program storage device or computer program product may include, but is not limited to, CD-ROM, CD-R, CD-RW, diskettes, tapes, hard drives, computer system memory (e.g. RAM or ROM), and/or the electronic, magnetic, optical, biological or other similar embodiment of the program (including, but not limited to, a carrier wave modulated, or otherwise manipulated, to convey instructions that can be read, demodulated/decoded and executed by a computer). Indeed, the article of manufacture, program storage device or computer program product may include any solid or fluid transmission medium, whether magnetic, biological, optical, or the like, for storing or transmitting signals readable by a machine for controlling the operation of a general or special purpose computer according to the method of the invention and/or to structure its components in accordance with a system of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the invention may also be implemented in a system. A system may comprise a computer that includes a processor and a memory device and optionally, a storage device, an output device such as a video display and/or an input device such as a keyboard or computer mouse. Moreover, a system may comprise an interconnected network of computers. Computers may equally be in stand-alone form (such as the traditional desktop personal computer) or integrated into another apparatus (such as a cellular telephone). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The system may be specially constructed for the required purposes to perform, for example, the method of the invention or it may comprise one or more general purpose computers as selectively activated or reconfigured by a computer program in accordance with the teachings herein stored in the computer(s). The system could also be implemented in whole or in part as a hard-wired circuit or as a circuit configuration fabricated into an application-specific integrated circuit. The invention presented herein is not inherently related to a particular computer system or other apparatus. The required structure for a variety of these systems will appear from the description given. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been described in relation to certain embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that other embodiments according to the generic principles disclosed herein, modifications to the disclosed embodiments and changes in the details of construction, arrangement of parts, compositions, processes, structures and materials selection all may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention Changes, including equivalent structures, acts, materials, etc., may be made, within the purview of the appended claims, without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention in its aspects. Thus, it should be understood that the above described embodiments have been provided by way of example rather than as a limitation of the invention and that the specification and drawing(s) are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. As such, the invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown above but rather is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed in any fashion herein. </paragraph>
