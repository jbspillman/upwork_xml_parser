<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,998,611 is an prior invention of William Shuie who is the inventor among this invention, which discloses a coin distinguishing mechanism for a coin keeper, comprising: one detection means, one circuitry and one display means. The detection means gets the signal via a mechanical apparatus and sends the signal to the circuitry, the output result will be shown on the display means. The detection means has a passageway defined by two flat opposite walls to detect diameter of inserted coins, wherein one of which is a fixed wall and the other is a movable wall The two walls are spaced from each other by a distance less than the diameter of a smallest coin. In the detection means there is also an arm to be actuated at one end by the movable wall that is affixed to a rack gliding along an arched conductive strip. On the arm there is also fixed a pinion engaging to the rack. And there is also a conductive wiper on the arm. The circuitry comprises an arched conductive strip and plurality of contact segments lined in an arc. Once the conductive wiper contacts a certain contact segment, it will generate a signal and send to the circuitry to process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The above-mentioned apparatus enables accurate distinguishing of the micro difference in diameters of coins inserted into the passageway of the fixed wall and movable wall by the magnifying measurement of the attached arm. However, since the diameters and denominations of coins of each country vary from each other greatly, it makes the design of conductive wiper and contact segment very complicated and therefore causes complicated specifications and enhances product cost. Although many orders have been given to the coin distinguishing mechanism for a coin keeper, it ceased to produce because of complicated specifications as well as of high product cost. However, it is very hard to invent a kind of detection means of low cost yet applicable to coins of various countries. Inventors have studied a variety of coin distinguishing methods and apparatus but failed to find one that meets this demand. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The detection means (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) has a passageway for inserted coins defined by two flat opposite walls to detect coin diameter, wherein one of which is a fixed wall (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>) and the other is a movable wall (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). There is an arm (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) actuated by the movable wall (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). The arm (<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>) is attached with a pinion (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>) to which a rack (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) that can glide along a strip is engaged. The rack (<highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>) is further affixed with the movable wall (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The integrated circuitry is connected to the initializing and choice unit (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>). The integrated circuitry processes a display means (<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>) as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>; a circuit board (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. On the circuit board (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) there is installed an arched conductive strip (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) and plurality of contact segments (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) concentric with the conductive strip (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, queue the plurality of contact segments (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) on the circuit board (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) together with the initializing and choice unit (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) of the microprocessor (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) into descending number N, N minus 1 (N&minus;1), N minus 2 (N&minus;2), etc. A preferred one is to queue them into ascending serial number 0, 1, 2, 3 . . . N, in which contact segment number 0 (<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) is the start point, and all the other contact segments are divided into several groups in succession. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A preferred way to divide the contact segments is to divide all the other contact segments except the start point (<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) into three groups and the contact segments of each group (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) are connected with each other as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Define number 1 as contact segment A to represent group 1, number 2 as contact segment B to represent group 2, number 3 as contact segment C to represent group 3. Divide contact segments number 4 to number N (4&minus;N) into three groups as follows and connect to contact segment A, B, or C respectively, i.e., contact segments whose serial numbers are 1 plus 3n (1&plus;3n) to contact segment A, those whose serial numbers are 2 plus 3n (2&plus;3n) to contact segment B and those whose serial numbers are 3 plus 3n (3&plus;3n to contact segment C; n can be any integer between 1 and 10. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, contact segment <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on the microprocessor (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) of the initializing and choice unit (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) is connected to the start point (<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) whose serial number is 0 on the circuit board (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>); contact segment <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is connected to contact segment A whose serial number is 1; contact segment <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is connected to contact segment B whose serial number is 2; contact segment <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is connected to contact segment C whose serial number is 3. Contact segment <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is connected to the detection means (<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) and contact segment <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to a denomination-initializing switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a coin denomination distinguishing method that can initialize reference denominations. As mentioned above, it comprises: one circuit board (<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>) on which there is installed an arched conductive strip (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) and plurality of contact segments (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) lined in an arc concentric with the conductive strip (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>); one initializing and choice unit (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) with a microprocessor (<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>) that is connected with the circuit board and sweep; one sweep (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) concentric with the conductive strip (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) that can glide along an imaginary arched path and that can contact the conductive strip (<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>) at one end and one of the plurality of contact segments (<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) lined in an arc at the other end; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, queue the plurality of contact segments into a certain serial numbers in succession (block <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>); divide contact segments No. 1&minus;N into group A, B and C and connect with each other of the same group, in which contact segments whose serial numbers are 1 plus 3n (1&plus;3n) belong to group A, those whose serial numbers are 2 plus 3n (2&plus;3n) belong to group B and those whose serial numbers are 3 plus 3n (3&plus;3n) belong to group C (block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>). When the coin is inserted for the first time (block <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>), the sweep (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) is actuated by the movable wall and contacts plurality of contact segments, the apparatus will then select the signal corresponding to the maximum serial number (block <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>) and check the corresponding coin denomination (block <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>) with those having been stored in the stacker of the initializing and choice unit (<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) to judge whether the detected measurement has already had a corresponding reference denomination stored (block <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>), if no, press key to adjust coin denomination (block <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>) until the correct denomination comes out (block <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>). Use the denomination-initializing switch of the initializing and choice unit to define a reference denomination (block <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>). Repeat this procedure until all reference denominations are defined (block <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>). This apparatus can automatically detect whether there has already stored corresponding reference coin denomination to any inserted coin, if yes, this apparatus can judge its denomination by its diameter and display it automatically (block <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> If an ascending serial number 0, 1, 2, 3 . . . N is employed, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when starting to measure, a preferred embodiment is to predefine coin diameter equal to 1 (block <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>) and the conductive wiper of the sweep (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) should move from contact segment 0, i.e., the start point (<highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>) to contact segments in group A whose serial numbers are 1 plus 3n (1&plus;3n) (block <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>) and further move to contact segments of group B whose serial numbers are 2 plus 3n (2&plus;3n) and to contact segments of group C whose serial numbers are 3 plus 3n (3&plus;3n) (block <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>). If the conductive strip of the sweep (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) doesn&apos;t move, the apparatus will remain in detecting mode. Once a moving direction is detected from A to B, or B to C, or C to A (block <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>), the measurement result is coin diameter plus 1 (block <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>); if not, the apparatus will detect and judge the moving direction again to see whether it is from B to A, or C to B, or A to C (block <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>), if so, the measurement result is coin diameter minus 1 (block <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>); if still not, the apparatus will detect and judge the moving direction for a third time to see whether it is from A to the start point (block <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>), if so, measuring is over and the apparatus will select the maximum distinguished measurement as coin diameter (block <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>). Each time the coin passes the passageway defined by the movable wall (<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) and the fixed wall (<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>), the detecting measurement can return to the initialized reference measurement and therefore cause no effect if coin is inserted incorrectly into the passageway. And after the detection is finished, the conductive wiper of the sweep (<highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>) will be dragged by an elastic element to return to the start point (block <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>). If it is not from A to the start point, it means the measuring is not over and the apparatus will detect again with the above-mentioned method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the aforegoing embodiment is described herewith for merely explaining the practicality of the present invention. There are still some variations which can be developed by taking the main idea of the present invention as basis, therefore, it is not expected to be treated as a limitation of the scope of the claims. </paragraph>
