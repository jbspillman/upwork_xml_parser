<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention relate to logic gates. In particular, embodiments of the present invention relate to the topology of differential domino logic gates. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Domino logic is often used in high speed integrated circuits. A domino circuit is a type of circuit that is arranged in stages with the outputs from one stage used as inputs into the next stage. A stage in the domino circuit may be, for example, a logic gate. The clock used with a domino circuit typically is delayed for each of the individual stages to provide a set-up time for the stages. The individual domino logic gates typically have one or more precharge blocks, which force the circuit to a known state during one phase of a clock, and one or more evaluation blocks, which provide output values that are based on the input values. In such domino circuits, the clock may be said to have a precharge phase and an evaluation phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Domino circuits generally have a static stage in between the domino stages. For example, the domino circuit may have an inverter between the domino stages or a static complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) gate between the domino stages. Another example is the zipper domino circuit, which has a P-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (PMOS) gate between the domino stages. In a cascaded domino circuit, the outputs from one N-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (NMOS) domino gate (i.e., a gate with NMOS transistors in the evaluation block) may be directly connected to the inputs of another NMOS domino gate. Thus, a cascaded domino circuit does not have any invertors, static stages, or PMOS gates in the critical path of the logic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Domino logic gates may be constructed as differential circuits. A differential circuit has complimentary sets of input and output terminals. The first set of input and output terminals may be referred to as the &ldquo;true&rdquo; inputs and outputs, and the second set may be referred to as the &ldquo;compliment&rdquo; inputs and outputs. For example, a differential &ldquo;AND gate&rdquo; may have a set of true inputs and may have a true output that outputs the result of a logical AND function for the true inputs. In addition, the differential AND gate may have a set of compliment inputs, each of which may receive the compliment values of that received by the corresponding true input, and may have a compliment output that outputs the compliment value of the true output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Differential domino circuits have been shown to operate at higher speeds and have a smaller size that other comparable circuits. Some differential domino circuits, such as the cascaded differential domino circuits, may be difficult to design and manufacture because the true and compliment outputs of the gates in the circuit should begin to switch with the same edge rate and not be susceptible to pattern dependence. In addition, the clock may arrive at the same time, or before, the data. For these reasons, differential domino circuits such as cascaded differential domino circuits have not been widely used.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention discloses differential domino logic gate topologies that may be more easily designed and manufactured while still predictably achieving the desired logic functionality. In embodiments of the present invention, the differential domino gate is symmetric. According to one embodiment, the differential domino gate is designed so that the load or capacitance for the true inputs to the gate is the same as the load for the compliment inputs to the gate. In a further embodiment, the pull down strength for the true output(s) (i.e., the resistance of the transistors pulling down the outputs) is the same as the pull down strength for the complement output(s). In a further embodiment, the pull down strength for the true inputs is the same as the pull down strength for the complement inputs. In a further embodiment, the Miller coupling is the same for the true inputs and complement inputs to the differential domino gate. In a further embodiment, the output drive strength is the same for the true and compliment output of the gate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention is a symmetric differential cascaded domino AND gate. In general, an &ldquo;AND gate&rdquo; is a circuit that implements the logical AND function, and a &ldquo;NAND gate&rdquo; is a circuit that implements the logical NAND function. A person or ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that a &ldquo;differential AND gate&rdquo; is the same as a differential NAND gate that has the true inputs/outputs switched with the compliment inputs/outputs. In addition, a person of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that, pursuant to De Morgan&apos;s theorems, a differential AND gate could be used as a differential OR gate by inverting the polarity of inputs/outputs. Thus, the designation to a differential &ldquo;AND gate&rdquo; as used herein will be understood to include a NAND gate, OR gate, and NOR gate. The present invention may also be used to design other differential domino logic gates such as discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a symmetric differential domino circuit according to an embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a differential domino circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that includes four stages (<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>) and a converter <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Differential domino circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has inputs <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and outputs <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Differential domino circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may carry out a particular function. For example, differential domino circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be an adder, a multiplier, etc. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a clock block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that produces clock signals <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> which are input to stages <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment, there is a small delay between the clock signals <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> (e.g., 10 picoseconds) in order to provide set up time for the stages of the domino logic operation. In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the first stage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is connected to the second stage <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the second stage <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is connected to the third stage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the third stage <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is connected to the fourth stage <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and the fourth stage <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is connected to converter <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In addition, clock block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is connected to each of the four stages (<highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>) and to converter <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Converter <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may convert signals to static logic signals before they are output over outputs <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment, each stage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be a differential logic gate, such as an AND gate, OR gate, etc. In other embodiments, stages <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be other components, such as for example a carry generate gate or a four-to-two reducer. Examples of differential logic gates that may be used as stages <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are discussed below. In an embodiment circuit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is a cascaded differential domino circuit and each sage <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are N-channel metal-oxide semiconductor domino gates, with the outputs of each stage directly connected to the inputs of the next stage. As used herein, two components A and B are said to be &ldquo;directly connected&rdquo; if there is a logic path between the two components that does not have any other components (e.g., gates or transistors) between components A and B but may include lead lines or connector lines between the components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a partial block diagram of a symmetric differential domino AND gate according to an embodiment of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows differential domino AND gate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> that has a clock input <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, a first input <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, and a second input <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. In addition, differential domino AND gate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a negative first input <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and a negative second input <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment, negative first input <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> receives the compliment of the value received on first input <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, and negative second input <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> receives the compliment of the value received on second input <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Differential domino AND gate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also has an output <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> and a negative output <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. In an embodiment, negative output <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> outputs the compliment of the value output at output <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. As would be appreciated by a person of skill in the art, an input &ldquo;value&rdquo; that is received by AND gate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, or output by AND gate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, is a voltage range that represents a logical value. Examples of voltage ranges for input and output values are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In an embodiment, input <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and input <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be referred to as true inputs, input <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and input <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> may be referred to as compliment inputs, output <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> may be referred to as the true output, and output <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> may be referred to as the compliment output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, differential domino AND gate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> has a transistor <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, two precharge transistors (first precharge transistor <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> and second precharge transistor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>), a keeper <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, a first evaluation block <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, and a second evaluation block <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, transistor <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> has a source terminal (&ldquo;source&rdquo;) connected to ground, a drain terminal (&ldquo;drain&rdquo;) connected to first evaluation block <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and second evaluation block <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, and a gate connected to clock input <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Transistor <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> maybe referred to as a footer transistor because it is at the bottom of the evaluation stacks. In this embodiment, footer transistor <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is an NMOS transistor. In other embodiments, the circuit may not have a clocked transistor at the bottom of the evaluation stacks. In this embodiment, clock <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is connected to the gates of first precharge transistor <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> and second precharge transistor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, and first precharge transistor <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> and second precharge transistor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> are PMOS transistors. The source of first precharge transistor <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> and the source of second precharge transistor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> are each connected to Vcc. The drain of first precharge transistors <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> is connected to negative output <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>, and the drain of second precharge transistor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is connected to output <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment first precharge transistor <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight> and second precharge transistor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> determine outputs of differential domino AND gate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> during the precharge phase, and footer transistor <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> enables the determination of the outputs of differential domino AND gate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> during the evaluation phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Keeper <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> includes a first keeper transistor <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> and second keeper transistor <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the source terminals of first keeper transistor <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> and of second keeper transistor <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> are each connected to Vcc. In this embodiment, first keeper transistor <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> and second keeper transistor <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> are PMOS transistors. The drain of first keeper transistor <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> is connected to negative output <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> and to the gate of second transistor <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the drain of second keeper transistor <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> is connected to output <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> and to the gate of first keeper transistor <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight>. Thus, first keeper transistor <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight> and second keeper transistor <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> are cross-coupled to each other. As discussed below, keeper <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is used to temporarily store the values determined by first evaluation block <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and second evaluation block <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, the gate does not use a keeper. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> First evaluation block <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and second evaluation block each have a plurality of transistors. In the embodiment shown, first evaluation block <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> comprises four transistors (first transistor <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight>, second transistor <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, third transistor <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>, and fourth transistor <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>) and second evaluation block <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> comprises four transistors (fifth transistor <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight>, sixth transistor <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, seventh transistor <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight>, and eight transistor <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>). In first evaluation block <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the source of first transistor <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> is connected to the drain of second transistor <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>, and the source of third transistor <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> is connected to the drain of fourth transistor <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>. The drain of first transistor <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and of third transistor <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> is connected to negative output <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. The source of second transistor <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and of fourth transistor <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> is connected to footer transistor <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. In second evaluation block <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the source of fifth transistor <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> is connected to the drain of sixth transistor <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, and the source of seventh transistor <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> is connected to the drain of eighth transistor <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. The drain of fifth transistor <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> and of seventh transistor <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> is connected to output <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. The source of the sixth transistor <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and eighth transistor <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> are connected to footer transistor <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the gate of each of the transistors in the first evaluation block <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is connected to either first input <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> or second input <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, and the gate of each of the transistors in the first evaluation block <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is connected to either negative first input <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> or negative second input <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. In particular, first input <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> is connected to the gate of second transistor <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and third transistor <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight>, second input <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is connected to the gate of first transistor <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and fourth transistor <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, negative first input <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> is connected to the gate of fifth transistor <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> and sixth transistor <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>, and negative second input <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is connected to the gate of seventh transistor <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> and eighth transistor <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. The operation of symmetric differential domino AND gate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is described below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> As a consequence of its topology, the differential domino AND gate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> shown in this embodiment is a symmetric differential domino AND gate. In an embodiment, the load for the true inputs <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is the same as the load for the compliment inputs <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, the pull down strength for the true inputs <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is the same as the pull down strength for the complement inputs <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, and the pull down strength for the true output <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> is the same as the pull down strength for the complement output <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. In addition, in symmetric differential domino AND gate <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> the Miller coupling for the true inputs (<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>) is equal to the Miller coupling for the compliment inputs (<highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>) and the output drive strength for the true output (<highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>) is the same as the output drive strength for the compliment output (<highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>). In an embodiment, transistors <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> are NMOS transistors. In this embodiment, the gate does not have any stacked PMOS devices. In an embodiment, each of transistors <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> are 1.78 microns. In a further embodiment the size of footer transistor <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is 2.14 microns. In a further embodiment the size of precharge transistor <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, second precharge transistor <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, first keeper transistor <highlight><bold>271</bold></highlight>, and second keeper transistor <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> are 1.52 microns. Of course, transistors with other sizes may also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> First evaluation block <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and second evaluation block <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> both comprise a plurality of transistors connected in a parallel relationship to each other and a plurality of transistors connected in a serial relationship to each other. For example, first transistor <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and second transistor <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> are in a serial relationship to each other because they are arranged serially as a stack along the path from the current source (footer transistor <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>) to negative output <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. As used herein, a current source is a path to ground. As another example, first transistor <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> is in a parallel relationship to both third transistor <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> and fourth transistor <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> because first transistor <highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> is a parallel path (i.e., from the source to negative output <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>) as compared to third transistor <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> and fourth transistor <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>.

Input <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and input <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> are very close together so as to appear almost as one waveform. Thus, in this example, inputs <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> are receiving the same values. Similarly, input <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and input <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> are very close together so as to appear almost as one waveform. In an embodiment, inputs <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> correspond to inputs <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, output <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> corresponds to output <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, inputs <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> correspond to inputs <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and output <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> corresponds to output <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> also shows the delays between waveforms in picoseconds (e.g., 26.2, 95.0, 10.1, 118.5, 26,3). During the precharge phase (e.g., at time&equals;150 ps), the outputs <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> are both at the same predetermined high value. As the inputs <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> change from a high value (1 volt) to a low value (0 volts), the output <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> (which represents the AND for <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>) also changes from a high value to a low value after a delay to get through the circuit. Similarly, as the inputs <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> change from a high value (1 volt) to a low value (0.8 volts), the output <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> (which represents the AND for <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>) also changes from a high value to a low value after a delay to get through the circuit. A person of skill in the art would of course appreciate that the waveforms shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> are just a sample of the waveforms that may occur for a circuit according to an embodiment of the present invention. In other embodiments, for example, the wavelengths, voltage ranges, and delays may be different. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a flow diagram of a method of performing a differential AND function according to an embodiment of the present invention. The method shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> may be performed by a symmetric differential AND gate such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. According to this method, a precharge phase of a clock is received by the circuit (<highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight>). A first input value and second input value are received at a first evaluation block (<highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>) and a third input value and fourth input value are received at a second evaluation block (<highlight><bold>403</bold></highlight>). In an embodiment, the first, second, third and fourth input values are received by the circuit at the same time as the precharge phase of the clock. A predetermined precharge signal is provided by the circuit to first and second outputs (<highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>). This precharge signal maybe provided during the duration of the precharge phase as determined by the clock. In an embodiment, these inputs values are received at substantially the same time. As this is a differential gate, the third input value may be the compliment of the first input value and the fourth input value may be the compliment of the third input value, in which case the first and second input values may be the true inputs and the third and fourth input values may be the compliment inputs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> At some point, the clock cycles from the precharge phase to an evaluation phase. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, after the clock cycles to the evaluation phase (<highlight><bold>405</bold></highlight>), the first, second, third, and fourth inputs may be processed. In an embodiment, when the clock cycles to the evaluation phase, a current source maybe provided to the first and second evaluation blocks. The current source may be, for example, the footer transistor <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> which is connected to ground and to the evaluation blocks as described above with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. A person of skill in the art would appreciate that footer <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> disables the current source during the precharge phase of the clock and enables the current source during the evaluation phase. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the first and second input values are processed in the first evaluation block to select one of a plurality of stacks from a current source through said first evaluation block to a first output (<highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>). In a further embodiment, the number of transistors in each of these stacks is the same. The third and fourth input values may be processed by the second evaluation block to select one of a plurality of stacks from a current source though the second evaluation block to a second output (<highlight><bold>407</bold></highlight>). In an embodiment, the number of transistors in each of the stacks in the second evaluation block is the same as the stacks though the first evaluation block. In an embodiment, processing of the first, second, third, and fourth inputs may take place at the same time. In an embodiment, the transistors in the first evaluation block and second evaluation block are the same size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the first evaluation block provides to the first output the results of an AND function on the first and second input values (<highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>) and the second evaluation block provides to the second output the results of an OR function on the third and fourth input values (<highlight><bold>409</bold></highlight>). In a further embodiment, the output from the first evaluation block and second evaluation block is provided to a keeper which maintains these values as the outputs of the circuit during the remainder of the evaluation phase (<highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>). This process may be repeated when the clock cycles back to the precharge phase (<highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the processing of the first and second inputs values by the first evaluation block and the processing of the third and fourth input values by the second evaluation block is described below. The following description references components shown in the embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, but of course other embodiments may operate in a similar fashion. A person of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that in this embodiment current flows from drain to source, the NMOS transistors drive the drain high when the current is turned on, and the PMOS transistors drive the drain low when turned on. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, when the clock changes to the evaluation phase, the footer transistor <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> is turned on and the drain of footer transistor <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, which is connected to the sources of the transistors at the bottom of the first evaluation block <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and second evaluation block <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, is driven high. This would cause a high value to be output at negative output <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> if the both the transistors in the first stack (<highlight><bold>231</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>) are turned on or both the transistors in the second stack (<highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>) are turned on. Thus, negative output <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> will be driven high only if a high value is input at both first input <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and second input <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The first evaluation block therefore performs an AND operation on the first input <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and second input <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and outputs the results to negative output <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight>. Similarly, output <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> would be driven high if both the transistors in the first stack (<highlight><bold>241</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>) of the second evaluation block are turned on or both the transistors in the second stack (<highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>) are turned on. Thus, output <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> will be driven high if a high value is input at negative first input <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> or negative second input <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The second evaluation block therefore performs an OR operation on negative first input <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and negative second input <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and drives output <highlight><bold>233</bold></highlight> to zero. Because the second set of inputs (<highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>) is the compliment of the first set of inputs (<highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>), the circuit will provide at output <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> the results of an AND operation on first input <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> and second input <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and will provide at negative output <highlight><bold>213</bold></highlight> the compliment of output <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> (i.e., the results of an OR operation on negative first input <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and negative second input <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Differential AND gates having symmetric topologies as described above have true and compliment outputs that begin to switch with the same edge rate and are not be susceptible to pattern dependence. Thus, these differential AND gates are easier to design and manufacture. The cascaded differential domino AND gate disclosed is relatively faster than prior gates because the circuit disclosed does not need to wait for the input to reach Vcc/2 (the gate threshold) before beginning to switch. The differential logic may act as a sense amp and allow for the clock to drive the transition with small differentials on the inputs. In embodiments of the invention, the AND gate has a series of NMOS transistors at the bottom of the NMOS tree that are driven by the clock, and the same transistors are present for both sides of the gate. Embodiments have series and parallel transistors on both sides of the gate and have transistors that are not used for the normal logic function connected to the output of the opposite polarity. The use of a higher NMOS stack may reduce leakage current. In an embodiment, PMOS keepers are sized to prevent cross-capacitance noise from disturbing the state of the logic. </paragraph>
