<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a device for adjustment of a trunnion, and more particularly relates to a device to adjust the heel of a table saw blade. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Various table saws for woodworking and the like are known and commercially available. A typical bench or floor-model table saw consists of a main chassis supporting a substantially flat, stationary work surface. The work surface is provided with a slot for the saw blade and at least one guide groove in the top of the work surface. The groove(s) are substantially parallel to the slot. The saw blade is mounted on a blade arbor so that it partially extends through the slot in the work surface. The blade arbor is part of a motor assembly mounted to a cradle under the work surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The spindles that support the cradle in most modem table saws are pivotally mounted between a pair of trunnions attached to the bottom of the work surface. One trunnion is fastened toward the front of the work surface, while the other trunnion is fastened toward the rear of the work surface. The trunnions allow the cradle to be tilted relative to the work surface by means of a hand crank. The operator is able by use of the crank, to produce cuts that are not necessarily at a right angle to the work surface. Also, modem table saws allow the operator to raise or lower the blade within the slot by means of another hand crank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is crucial that the blade arbor be at a substantial right angle to the guide groove in the work surface. In other words, the saw blade must be substantially parallel with the guide groove for accurate cutting. The orientation of the blade arbor to the guide groove is characterized as the heel of the table saw blade. Unfortunately, known means of blade heel adjustment are generally unsatisfactory. Each trunnion is typically fastened to the bottom of the work surface by stationary bolts that extend through oversized or slotted bolt holes in the trunnion. This enables one trunnion to be moved laterally a small amount relative to the other trunnion to correct misalignment of the blade arbor relative to the guide groove in the work surface when necessary. Thus, with known table saws, if the cutting blade is not parallel with the guide groove the bolts that fasten one trunnion to the supporting table are loosened. The trunnion and the cradle that it supports are then be forced or pried to change the heel of the saw blade, often using crude means such as striking the trunnion with a hammer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another known means of adjusting the heel of the saw blade involves the use of set screws placed on either side of the stationary bolts. The set screws may be loosened or tightened to move the trunnion and cradle. This form of adjustment requires expensive secondary machining to the trunnion, not to mention involved execution of the adjustment procedure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The adjustment device proposed according to the present invention addresses these and other difficulties when adjusting a trunnion. In particular, the present invention provides an inexpensive and direct solution to adjusting the heel of a saw blade relative to the guide grooves on the work surface. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with aspects of the present invention, a table saw includes a work support table that defines a blade slot therethrough and at least one guide groove oriented generally parallel to the slot. A pair of trunnions are attached to the lower surface of the work support table, with at least one of the trunnions defining an adjustment opening having opposing sides. A cradle assembly has a blade mounted therein driven by a motor, and it is supported by the trunnions such that at least a portion of the blade extends through the slot in the work support surface. An adjustment member is received by the adjustment opening in the trunnion and is rotatably attached to the lower surface of the work support table. Rotation of the adjustment member causes the adjustment member to contact one of the opposing sides of the adjustment opening, thus moving the trunnion to adjust the position of the blade relative to the guide groove. This allows a user of the table saw to more easily position the blade parallel to the guide groove to insure proper operation of the table saw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In exemplary embodiments of the invention, the adjustment member includes a generally cylindrical adjustment end that defines an off-center bore extending therethrough to form an eccentric. A second end that defines a bolt end or an adjustment handle is coupled to the eccentric to allow a user to easily rotate the eccentric adjustment end. The adjustment opening may define a variety of shapes; for example, the opening may be oval-shaped or U-shaped. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Illustrative embodiments of the invention are described below. In the interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers&apos; specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of this disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A, a</cross-reference> portion of an exposed table saw is depicted. The table saw has a work support surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that defines a slot <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. A blade <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> projects through the slot <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> in order to cut work pieces on the work surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The blade <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, which is driven in a conventional manner, is supported by a cradle assembly <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> attached to the bottom of the work support surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> by a pair of trunnions <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The cradle assembly <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> includes a blade arbor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that allows for the blade <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to rotate within the slot <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Parallel to the slot <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> lies a guide groove <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> in the work surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A typical table saw will have one or two guide grooves <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. It is essential that the guide grooves <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> be substantially parallel to the blade <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to produce proper cuts using the table saw. Therefore, the blade arbor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> must be kept perpendicular to the guide groove <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The blade arbor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is movable within the blade slot <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by means of the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> holds a motor assembly (not shown), the blade arbor <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the blade <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and other apparatus for the operation of the table saw. In certain embodiments, the blade <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be tilted to produce angled cuts by use of a tilting crank (not shown). When turning the crank, the blade <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is angled in reference to the flat work surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A, one trunnion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is visible. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> schematically shows the position of two trunnions <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. To support the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> below the work surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the trunnions <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> are positioned on either side of the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. An exemplary trunnion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the illustrated trunnion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> defines a spindle slot <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> for holding a spindle <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> of the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The spindle slot <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> allows the cradle <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to be tilted relative to the work support table <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to move the blade <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to an angled position. Bolts <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> attach the trunnion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to the bottom of the work surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The bolts <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> are installed through oversized slots <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) in side flanges <highlight><bold>177</bold></highlight> of the trunnion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The trunnion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> further includes a central flange <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> through which an adjustment member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> extends and attaches to the bottom of the work support table <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The central flange <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight> contains an adjustment opening <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which in the exemplary embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, comprises an oblong slot extending through the flange <highlight><bold>179</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>D illustrate an adjustment member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> that is received by the adjustment opening <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the trunnion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The adjustment member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is attached to the bottom of the work surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> such that it is rotatable about an off-center position to form an eccentric. In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the adjustment member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> defines a bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> extending therethrough. A bolt or other shaft extends through the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to attach the adjustment member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to the bottom of the work surface <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> so that the adjustment member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is rotatable about the bolt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The particular adjustment member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> includes a generally cylindrical end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> having the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> extending through the cylindrical end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> at an off center location. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, while the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is located at an off-center position relative to the cylindrical eccentric end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is generally centered relative to the flange <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and bolt end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In one exemplary embodiment, the cylinder <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> defines a diameter of about 0.880 inches, the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> defines a diameter of about 0.375 inches, and the center of the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is off-set about 0.075 inches from the center of the cylinder <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The eccentric end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the adjuster <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is received by the adjustment opening <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The illustrated adjustment member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> further includes a bolt end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> separated from the eccentric end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> by a flange <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the bolt end may comprise a standard hex-head, though a square-head or any other shape that lends itself to easy rotation is suitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> conceptually illustrates operation of the blade heel adjustment system described herein. When the adjustment member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is received by the adjustment opening <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the bolt end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) extends outside the adjustment opening <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and is easily turned by use of a common tool such as a wrench to rotate the eccentric end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. Rotation of the eccentric adjustment member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in one direction causes the eccentric end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to contact one of the opposing sides of the adjustment opening <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the trunnion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, while rotation in the other direction causes the eccentric end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to contact the other side of the adjustment opening <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The contact between the eccentric end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and the side of the adjustment opening results in lateral movement of the trunion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to adjust the blade heel as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference> illustrate blade heel adjustment systems in accordance with alternative embodiments of the invention. In the system shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, an adjustment handle is attached to the eccentric end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the adjustment member <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. The adjustment system of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> includes the trunnion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, including the oblong adjustment opening <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. An adjustment member <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> has an eccentric end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> that has an off-center bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> extending therethrough. An adjustment handle <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> replaces the bolt end <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the adjustment member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The adjustment handle <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> includes a generally cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> coupled to the eccentric end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> with a handle portion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> extending from the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. The bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is generally centered in the cylindrical portion <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> of the adjustment handle <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. A bolt <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight> extends through the bore <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to attach the adjustment member <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> to the bottom of the work support table <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and the adjustment member is rotatable about the bolt <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, the adjustment opening in the trunnion may have any number of different shapes. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates an alternative trunnion <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>, which includes a generally U-shaped adjustment opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> having an open end. The trunnion <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> is shown with the adjustment member <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, though the adjustment member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> described in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> could also be used with the trunnion <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>. The trunnion <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight> functions in the same manner as the trunnion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, wherein the eccentric end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the adjustment member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is received in the opening <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> such that rotation of the adjustment member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> results in the eccentric end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> contacting one or the other side of the opening <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to laterally move the trunnion <highlight><bold>171</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The eccentric end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> either has a shape that is geometrically located off center or has a shape that is not otherwise customarily found on a conventional bolt. Of course, the eccentric end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can have a variety of shapes beyond a simple cylinder as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. For example, the eccentric end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> may be in the shape of an oval or have another abnormal shape. If the end <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is oval-shaped, for example, it may not be necessary to rotate the adjustment member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> about an off-center location. A cylindrical end as depicted may require less machining or casting to produce than an alternative shapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> As noted above, a pair of trunnions <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> usually attach the cradle assembly <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to the bottom of the work support table <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In certain embodiments of the invention, the rear trunnion <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is provided with the adjustment opening <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> for cooperation with the adjustment member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>, as the rear trunnion generally offers easier access for an operator to adjust the heel of the saw blade. However, either the front or rear trunnion, or both trunnions, may be adjustable in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The particular embodiments disclosed above are illustrative only, as the invention may be modified and practiced in different but equivalent manners apparent to those skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings herein. Furthermore, no limitations are intended to the details of construction or design herein shown, other than as described in the claims below. It is therefore evident that the particular embodiments disclosed above may be altered or modified and all such variations are considered within the scope and spirit of the invention.
