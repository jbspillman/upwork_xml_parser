<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to spatial filtering of laser ghosts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a servo writer that is used to write optical servo marks on a digital linear tape, ghost images are produced as a result of the non-ideal phase nature of a beam-generating device or due to the unwanted scattering in the optical system. The ghost images generate unwanted servo marks on the digital linear tape. The unwanted servo marks produced by the ghost images can degrade the tracking resolution and tracking accuracy. In severe cases, it renders optical tracking impossible. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In a general aspect, the invention features an optical servo writer system including a laser generating beams of collimated light, a lens positioned to receive and focus the collimated light and a spatial filter positioned adjacent the lens to allow a subset of the collimated light to pass through the filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the system further includes an optical subsystem positioned between the laser and the lens, the optical subsystem receiving the beams of collimated light and splitting the beams. The spilt beams include servo beams and ghost beams. The subset is servo beams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The system may further include a digital linear tape positioned adjacent the spatial filter with the spatial filter allowing the subset of collimated light to hit the digital linear tape and produce servo marks. The optical subsystem includes an attenuator placed in proximity to a beam expander and a diffractive optical element. The optical subsystem includes a bi-prism and several lenses. The spatial filter includes a plurality of openings positioned to allow the subset of collimated light to pass through the filter. The plurality of openings are positioned relative to the plane of the digital linear tape to prevent debris from clogging the openings when the subset of collimated light hits the digital linear tape to produce servo marks. The position of successive openings is staggered relative to the plane of the digital linear tape. The spatial filter includes an ablatable film bonded to a clear substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features an optical system for producing a plurality of servo marks on a digital linear tape including a laser generating beams of collimated light, an optical subsystem positioned to receive the beams of collimated light and split the beams, a lens positioned to receive and focus the split beams and a spatial filter positioned adjacent the lens to allow a subset of the split beams to pass through the filter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the split beams include servo beams and ghost beams. The subset is the servo beams. The servo beams hit the digital linear tape. The spatial filter includes a plurality of apertures positioned to allow the subset of split beams to pass through the filter. The plurality of apertures is staggered with respect to each other so as to prevent clogging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features a method for producing optical servo marks on a digital linear tape including generating beams of collimated light in a laser, receiving and focusing the beams of collimated light in a lens and filtering the beams of collimated light near the focus of the lens to allow a subset of the beams to pass through a filter and hit the digital linear tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, generating further includes splitting the beams of collimated light into desired beams and ghost beams. Splitting is accomplished by passing the beams of collimated light through a diffractive optical element. Splitting is accomplished by passing the beams of collimated light through a bi-prism lens to generate two beams that are then brought back together by several lenses to form multiple spots on the tape by means of two-beam interference. The subset of beams is the desired beams. Filtering includes passing the beams of collimated light to a spatial filter. The spatial filter includes a plurality of openings positioned to allow the subset to pass through the filter. The plurality of openings is generated in situ. Generating the openings includes providing a solid spatial filter, generating openings in the spatial filter by allowing the subset to cut through the spatial filter to produce the plurality of openings. The openings are staggered with respect to each other to minimize clogging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the invention features an optical servo writer system for a digital linear tape including a laser optics system generating beams of collimated light, a first lens positioned to receive and focus the collimated light, a spatial filter positioned adjacent the lens to allow a subset of the collimated light to be focused and pass through the filter and a second lens positioned to restore the subset into collimated beams which propagate towards a third lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the beams include servo beams and ghost beams. The subset is servo beams. The third lens focuses the subset onto the digital linear tape producing servo marks. The laser optics system includes a laser source for producing light to an attenuator and a beam expander for receiving the light and expanding the beam to become a collimated beam with the proper diameter and sending it to a diffractive optical element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The laser optics system includes a laser source for producing light to a bi-prism lens to generate two beams that are then brought back together by several lenses to form multiple spots on the tape by means of two-beam interference. The spatial filter includes a plurality of openings positioned to allow the subset through the spatial filter. The first lens is a planar-convex lens. The second lens is a planar-convex lens. The third lens is a scan lens. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the invention may have one or more of the following features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Multiple laser beams are produced from a single laser beam using a bi-prism or a diffractive optical element in a beam-generating device. The beams are focused onto a digital linear tape by a lens to form multiple marks along a line oriented perpendicular to the tape transport direction. An aperture for spatial filtering is used to eliminate ghost beams. The spatial filter is located near, but not at, the focal plane and can eliminate, or at least significantly reduce the marks generated by the ghosts and improve servo resolution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> To insure accurate alignment between the desired beams and the openings in the spatial filter, the openings in the spatial filter can be generated in situ by placing a film supported on a substrate within the path of multiple beams and having them cut through the spatial filter to form the openings. The ghost beams are not of sufficient power to cut through the spatial filter. The spatial filter may also be configured to prevent clogging of its openings by tape debris. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> first exemplary optical servo writer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a laser <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, attenuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a beam expander <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> produces optical servo marks on a tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The laser <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generates optical electromagnetic energy such as coherent collimated light <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> directed toward the attenuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Light emerging from the attenuator <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is directed toward the beam expander <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Light coming out of the beam expander <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is directed toward the diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which splits the input beam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into multiple beams <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that have approximately equal powers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, a bi-prism lens may replace the diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is a device that is commercially available. The diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has planar elements including zones that retard the incident wave by a modulation of the refractive index or by a modulation of the surface profile. The light emitted from the different zones interferes and forms the desired wave front pattern. One type of diffractive optical element, which splits the incident laser beam to form a multiple or an array of beams with approximate equal intensity and angular separation, is called a Fourier array generator, or fan out element. As the light beam <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> impinges on the diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> multiple beams <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can also generate unwanted beams in addition to the desired multiple beams <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The unwanted beams are referred to as ghost beams <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The ghost beams <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can also be caused by extraneous light scattered from dirt or imperfections in the diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The multiple beams <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and ghost beams <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> travel into the lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a focal length f and can be a simple planar-convex lens, or a more complex lens such as a scanning lens, depending on the optical field of view and the desired optical spot size. The lens <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> focuses the multiple beams <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and ghost beams <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> onto the tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, generating an array of marks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> generally referred to as optical servo tracks (or marks). As the tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> moves multiple optical servo tracks (continuous) are inscribed on the tape surface. If a pulsed laser <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is used, intermittent multiple optical servo tracks (intermittent dot marks) can be generated on the tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The ghost beams <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may cut the tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and form unwanted marks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A goal of the present invention is to eliminate the ghost beams <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> so that they will not impinge upon the tape <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and generate unwanted marks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an optical servo writer system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a laser <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, attenuator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, beam expander <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, a diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and three lenses <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is used to produce optical servo marks <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> on a tape <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The laser <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> generates a beam of collimated light <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> directed toward the attenuator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Light <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> leaving the attenuator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is directed toward the beam expander <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Light <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> coming out of the beam expander <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is directed toward the diffractive optical element <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> where it is split into desired beams <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, i.e., servo beams, and undesired beams <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, i.e., ghost beams. The beams <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> pass toward the lens <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the desired beams <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> pass through a spatial filter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The spatial filter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes one or more openings (also known as spatial filter openings or apertures) <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> that are spaced along the filter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to allow the desired beams <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to pass towards the lens <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> while blocking the undesired ghost beams <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The spatial filter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can take on several forms. One example is a simple mechanical slit. Etching the desired filter pattern onto a glass coated with an opaque thin film, such as Chromium, or Gold, or silver, or other suitable alloy could generate another example filter. Any suitable film placed on a stable optically transparent substrate may be used as the spatial filter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Yet another example is an ablatable film placed on a stable optically transparent substrate from which the filter is generated by the forming beam itself. The desired beams <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> travel from the lens <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to lens <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and impact the tape <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> generating useful marks on the tape <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. These marks are known as optical servo marks <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The placement of the spatial filter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in the beam path allows the desired beams <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to &ldquo;cut&rdquo; the tape <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to generate useful marks <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> while preventing the undesired ghost beams <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> from passing on to cut the tape <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and form unwanted marks. Each of the openings <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are sized to be just larger than the diameter of the desired beams <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> at their focal points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In an example, lens <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are spherical lenses having equal focal points, i.e., f<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&equals;f<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, such as planar-convex lenses, for example, and lens <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is a scan lens. In general, f<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and f<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> need not be equal to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The principle of forming a spatial filter by the ablatable film is described here. The spatial filter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be generated in situ by placing a solid ablatable film in the optical servo writer system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As the desired beams <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> cross the solid ablatable film one or more openings <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are generated by the selected beams <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>; this ablatable film with openings <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> now becomes the spatial filter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. However, no openings <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are generated by the ghost beams <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> because they are of much weaker power than the desired beams <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and thus, due to the characteristics of the film used in the spatial filter <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, cannot penetrate or cut through the ablatable film to provide the necessary openings <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> second exemplary optical servo writer system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a laser <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, a bi-prism <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and lenses <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to produce optical servo marks <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> on a tape <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The laser <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> generates a beam of light <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> directed towards the bi-prism <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, which splits the light <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> into desired beams <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and unwanted ghost beams <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The desired beams <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and ghost beams <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> pass through the lens <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> and onto the spatial filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The spatial filter <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> contains two openings <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> positioned to allow the desired beams <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> to pass to the lens <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> while preventing the unwanted ghost beams <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from passing further toward the tape <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The two beams <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> pass from the lens <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to the cylinder lens <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and onto the tape <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> where they generate multiple servo marks <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> by means of two-beam interference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, an optical servo writer system <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a laser <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, servo writer optics <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, a lens <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and a spatial filter <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> to produce optical servo marks <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> on a tape <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The servo writer optics <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is considerably simpler when the special filter <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is placed in close proximity to the tape <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. As described above, the spatial filter <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> includes openings <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> positioned to allow desired beams <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to pass and cut or etch the tape <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to generate servo marks <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> while excluding ghost beams <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> from generating unwanted servo marks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As the multiple beams <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> cut the tape <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to generate the servo marks <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, pieces of tape debris may clog the openings <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> when the spatial filter <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is positioned in close proximity to the tape <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B, a</cross-reference> system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> to avoid this problem is shown, where the spatial filter <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is positioned such that the multiple openings <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are staggered with respect to each other and to the cross-sections of the beams <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Thus, upper and lower parts of the spatial filter <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> are sheared along the focus of the lens <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> producing, in effect, a staggering of the openings <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The diagonal positioning, i.e., the shearing, of the spatial filter <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is dependent upon the separation between the desired beams <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the ghost beams <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. With such an arrangement, tape debris generated during the cutting of the tape by the desired beams <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is prevented from clogging the openings <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in the spatial filter <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> because of their staggered positioning with respect to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> process <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> for spatial filtering of laser ghosts in an optical servo writer includes generating <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> beams of collimated light in a laser. The process <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> splits <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> the beams of collimated light in an optical subsystem, producing desired beams and ghost beams. The process <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> receives <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> the desired beams and the ghost beams and focuses <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> the desired beams and ghost beams in a lens. The process <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> filters <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> the ghost beams by allowing the desired beams to pass through openings of a spatial filter positioned adjacent the lens. Servo marks are generated <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> on a digital linear tape positioned adjacent the spatial filter by the desired beams hitting the digital linear tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Alignment of the openings with the desired beams is important so that the ghost beams are not allowed to pass on to the digital linear tape and generate undesirable ghost servo marks that can degrade tracking resolution and tracking accuracy when optical servo marks are used to position the digital linear tape in relation to a magnetic recording head by an optical servo system. Proper alignment of the desired beams to the openings may be accomplished by generating the openings of the spatial filter in situ along with a knowledge that the ghost beams are of considerably less power than the desired beams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> process <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> of generating in situ openings in a spatial filter residing in an optical servo writer system includes positioning <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> a solid spatial filter at the focal plane of a lens, such as the filter plane in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Desired beams and ghost beams are passed <highlight><bold>524</bold></highlight> to the solid spatial filter. The desired beams cut through <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> the solid spatial filter to produce openings in the spatial filter. The ghost beams, being of considerably less power than the desired beams, fail to cut through the spatial filter and are thus blocked by the spatial filter. </paragraph>
