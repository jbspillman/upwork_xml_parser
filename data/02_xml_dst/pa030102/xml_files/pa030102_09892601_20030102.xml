<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to an elongated, nonconductive flexible rod commonly used by electricians and telephone or communications installers and technicians, and referred to in the art as &ldquo;fishtape&rdquo;. Fishtape is typically used to facilitate installation of wire and cable through conduit or other passageway in walls, ceilings, and floors of buildings. Standard fishtapes are made of 0.080&Prime; to 0.500&Prime; diameter fiberglass or extruded plastic, and are supplied in reels containing 50 or more feet of tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Because most electrical wire and cable is relatively thin and flexible, pushing it through long lengths of conduit is virtually impossible. To facilitate running wire and cable using fishtape, a length of fishtape is first fed through the conduit from one open end to the other. The wire or cable is then attached to a leading end of the fishtape, and the fishtape pulled back through the conduit with the attached wire or cable trailing behind. During this process, substantial friction resistance is often encountered between the surfaces of the fishtape, wires or cables, and the walls of the conduit or passageway through which the wires or cables are being pulled. Overcoming this resistance generally requires considerable pulling force. To be effective, a fishtape must be stiff enough to be pushed through conduit, flexible enough to negotiate bends or turns in the conduit, and strong enough to pull multiple wires or cables back through the conduit, overcoming the friction resistance without breaking or separating from the wires or cables being pulled. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT AND BEST MODE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring now specifically to the drawings, a fishtape according to the present invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and shown generally at reference numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is commonly supplied in a reel, such as reel <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, containing 50 or more feet of tape. Examples of fishtape reels are provided in applicant&apos;s prior issued patents, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,106,056 and 5,340,084. The complete disclosure of these patents is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the present fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a fiberglass core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and exterior nylon sheath <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A number of circumferentially-spaced, longitudinal ribs <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are formed in the sheath <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and serve to promote fishability of the fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through narrow passageways in buildings and other structures. The longitudinal ribs <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> enhance the column strength and overall stiffness of the fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, each rib <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is defined by a point &ldquo;P&rdquo; with grooves &ldquo;G&rdquo; formed on opposite sides of the point. The ribs <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> create a reduced area of contact between the fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and structure of the passageway, thereby reducing the effect of friction and requiring less tensile force to pull the fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> back through the passageway. In addition, the grooves &ldquo;G&rdquo; provide spaces for lubricants which may be applied to the fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to further reduce friction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the example illustrated, the outer diameter of the fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> measured from point to point is 0.195 inches. The diameter of the fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> measured from groove to groove is 0.185 inches. The diameter of the fiberglass core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is 0.080 inches. The fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes 20 rib points &ldquo;P&rdquo; with each point being defined by an angular distance &ldquo;&agr;&rdquo; of 18 degrees, as measured from a bottom of the grooves &ldquo;G&rdquo;. The radius of each rib point &ldquo;P&rdquo; and groove &ldquo;G&rdquo; is 0.005 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A process for forming the fishtape is illustrated generally in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Nylon pellets are fed into a hopper <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, heated, and moved downstream through the extruder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to a forming die <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. A spooled length of fiberglass rod <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> forming the core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> passes from spool <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> through the forming die <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> together with the heated nylon forming the outer sheath <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The die <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a toothed cross-section which forms longitudinal ribs <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the nylon sheath <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> as the fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> exits the extruder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the nylon is heated in the extruder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to a temperature of approximately 550 degrees F. When applied to the fiberglass rod <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> at the forming die <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the heated nylon causes the outer coating of the fiberglass rod <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to melt away, thus creating an increased bond between the nylon sheath <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and fiberglass core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The increased bond reduces the potential for movement of the fiberglass core <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within the outer sheath <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As a result, the fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is capable of achieving a smaller bend radius without failure. Moreover, the synergistic combination of nylon and fiberglass during extrusion creates a fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with a higher flex strength and abrasion resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> From the forming die <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> passes through a quench trough <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> containing water cooled to a temperature of 42-45 degrees F. The length of the trough <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is approximately 20-25 feet. From the quench trough <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, the fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> passes through a laser mike gauger <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which gauges the diameter of the fishtape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> prior to collection by a take-up winder (not shown). A pull roll unit <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> downstream of the gauger <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> maintains a processing speed of approximately 25 feet per minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A fishtape is described above. Various details of the invention may be changed without departing from its scope. Furthermore, the foregoing description of the preferred embodiment of the invention and the best mode of practicing the invention are provided for the purpose of illustration only and not for the purpose of limitation-the invention being defined by the claims. </paragraph>
