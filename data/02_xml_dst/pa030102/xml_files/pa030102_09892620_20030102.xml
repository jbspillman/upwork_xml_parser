<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the fabrication of semiconductor devices with self-aligned, raised source/drain. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The self-aligned contact (SAC) is widely known as a fabrication technique for reducing the cell size of memory units. Memory devices fabricated using SACs are commonly formed on the same CMOS chip as the logic circuits that address them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Higher logic circuit performance is often obtained by using salicide (self-aligned silicide) processes. Anneal of a refractory metal layer causes the underlying silicon to react with the metal layer and produces a silicide overlying gate electrode and source and drain regions. These silicided regions have lower resistance than non-silicided regions. This is especially true of smaller geometries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Silicidation is widely used in the art. As device design density shrinks for CMOS devices covering both deep trench dynamic random access memory (DT DRAM) and addressing logic, existing process integration schemes fail to meet contact requirements, especially as CMOS devices are scaled down to 150 nm node. Success of future CMOS process integration will largely depend on successful formation of healthy contacts that provide ultra-shallow contact junctions (X<highlight><subscript>JC</subscript></highlight>) with low leakage and that also provide low contact resistance (R<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>)and with high doping concentration in the silicide contact interface (N<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>). Process integration also requires consideration of other critical process criteria such as cost, thermal budget, device impact, reliability, etc. However, there is presently no universal proposal to make an advanced contact meeting ultimate requirements due to complex interrelationships among these parameters, each having its own process integration steps. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need for an integration scheme for formation of an advanced contact having characteristics of low R<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, high N<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, and shallow (X<highlight><subscript>JC</subscript></highlight>), all of which are all essential for CMOS devices scaled down to sub-150-nm node. The present invention provides such an integration scheme that works for W/WN gate electrodes, Dual Work Function Gates, Dual Gate MOSFETs, and SOI devices, among others. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The integration scheme of the present invention enables the formation of contacts meeting these fundamental requirements (as discussed above) for CMOS devices covering both DT DRAM and logic.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Advanced metal silicon (MS) contacts require high doping to form low resistance ohmic contacts. At these heavily doped MS junctions, the electron emission (TE) is dominated by field emission (FE) and thermal-field emission (TFE), leading to higher contact conductivity. However, a very high surface concentration of dopants naturally leads to deeper junctions because of concentration dependent diffusion. This effect transiently increases following a high-energy implantation step due to the anomalous diffusion effect of transient enhanced diffusion (TED). This transient effect results from the thermal treatment (anneal) of the silicon that is necessary to activate the implanted ions (i.e., to move the dopant atoms to substitutional sites), and to remove residual implantation damage. In this way, the objective of low R<highlight><subscript>C </subscript></highlight>and shallow (X<highlight><subscript>JC</subscript></highlight>) work against one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, silicidation on heavily doped Si is often considerably more difficult than that of undoped Si. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> To overcome these several effects, it is ideal to have an integration scheme which incorporates steps for (1) an elevated contact window to compensate for Si consumption during silicidation and junction diffusion into Si, (2) silicidation with a refractory metal (such as tungsten (W), cobalt (Co), and titanium (Ti) for ULSI processes) to assure a low resistance MS contact, and (3) controlled doping by an ion implantation method. During ion implantation, the implantation depth and doping level can be optimized independently. It is also beneficial to perform implantation through silicidation layers, in order to extend the high-energy implantation scheme. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Dopant can also be provided from the silicidation later in the process (silicide as doping source (SADS)), this relaxes the requirement for uniform silicide layers while still avoiding a short channel effect through shallow junction formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, there are shown a flow diagram for a first embodiment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>) and an alternative embodiment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference>) of the present invention, for concurrently achieving an elevated (or raised) contact window structure followed by a selective W silicidation step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> First, for the step in block <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, conventional junction formation is performed by lightly doping a drain area on the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, implanting drains <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and sources <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, followed by an annealing step. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Then, for the step in block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, interlevel dielectric layer (IDL) <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> deposition and S/D contact etch are performed. Integrated CB/CS etch (identical etch requirements) is performed for the DRAM case. A self-aligned contact (SAC) <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> etch process and de-coupling CS from contact to gate (CG) etch provides a wider process window. Tool/process commonality occurs between CS/CB and CG as well as independent optimization. Further, gate conductor (GC) is protected from CS-GC misalignment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> For the step of block <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, surface amorphization <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through screen oxide is performed. Low energy inert ions are implanted, i.e., blanket implant. In-situ doping is accomplished for masked implantation using In, Sb and BF<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Non-critical implantation is accomplished by plasma doping (PLAD) or plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). Implantation is accomplished through a sacrificial screen oxide or nitride. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> For the step of block <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, selective HSG/MSP growth is performed within and on the bottom of the contact window, i.e., a wet clean followed by selective amorphous-Si growth at 40. For DRAM, this has been utilized to form a high capacitance capacitor by increasing surface areas. Cluster tools are employed for in-situ cleaning, doping and capping processes. Film thickness can be controlled for an optional silicidation process integration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> For the step of block <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, selective chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of polysilicon and tungsten (W) <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> followed by anneal for silicidation (double salicidation) is performed. SiH<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>/WF<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>is preferred for gate oxide reliability. Temperature and resistance is comparable to polysilicon. Grain size and thickness optimization are implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> For the step of block <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, ion mixing is performed using low energy, high dose implantation by plasma doping (PLAD) or plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) to optimize the doping conditions of NMOS and PMOS contacts. Dopants will remain within the salicidation layer for post diffusion into the junction by a silicide as doping source (SADS) method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> High energy, low dose implantation through salicidation into MS interface for better ohmic contact is also performed at this step to optimize the Shottky barrier height (SBH) on the MS interface while maintaining shallow junction contact. Ion mixing can be accomplished using various ion species. In a preferred embodiment, the energy and dose is optimized depending upon the silicidation thickness and junction depth. Sheet resistance requirements are secondary, inasmuch as low energy silicide as doping source (SADS) will be responsible for R<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>, thus improving the process window during the implantation process. High energy, low current implantation is a well-developed area for extreme dose and energy control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Only non-critical blocking masks are used during the step of block <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> For the step of block <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B, an additional masking step for DRAM may be needed for an array implantation to lower the doping level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> For the step of block <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> rapid thermal processing (RTP) anneal is performed to quench off crystalline damage induced by implantation and to electrically activate dopants. A capping layer contains dopants. Diffusion through silicidation (SADS) and high doping concentration by plasma doping (PLAD) are employed in this step. Shallow junctions with low contact resistance are achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> For the step of block <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> dedicated CG etch <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is performed. Also created is a stop on top of a metal gate (i.e., W/WN). The CG etch step provides independent optimization from the CS etch. Greater process latitude is achieved by a selective sequential etch which is insensitive to process non-uniformity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Finally, for the step of block <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> metal line (e.g., M0 for DRAM) litho and etch process&mdash;local tier process is performed for a via first dual Damascene integration scheme. Ti/TiN is deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or ionized physical vapor deposition (iPVD) for a conformal barrier/adhesion layer <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. A metal fill <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, by deposition of tungsten (W), or other metal (Cu) with low-k IDL, is then followed by chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) plus a (semi-) global tier process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> An alternative preferred embodiment is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>B, wherein steps <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A replace steps <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the process flow illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference>. This alternative results in the following deviations from the steps of the preferred embodiment discussed above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> For the step of block <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>A, IDL is oxide or other low-k material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> For the step of block <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>A, surface amorphization is accomplished by heavy, low energy ion implantation with the ion species implanted being an insert or active species. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> For the step of block <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A, hemispherical grain (HSG) size and thickness are optimized for the process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> For the step of block <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A, CVD W-deposition is preferably accomplished by diclorosilane chemistry (SiH<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>Cl<highlight><subscript>s</subscript></highlight>) for gate protection against fluorine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> For the step of block <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A, ion mixing (low energy and high energy co-implantation) are accomplished with non-activating species, such as nitrogen or other metal ions, to suppress dopant diffusion or to improve the MS contact by adjusting SBH. Silicidation thickness and grain size are optimized to achieve post silicidation dopant diffusion for SADS process. The HSG grain size and thickness are also optimized to fulfill implantation conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The process of the present invention integrates the conventional salicide process for logic circuits employing a W-Salicide combined with ion mixing implantation, with a self-aligned contact process for memory circuits, so that memory and logic devices fabricated together on the same wafer have low contact resistance (R<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>), shallow contact junction depth (X<highlight><subscript>JC</subscript></highlight>) and high doping concentration in the silicide contact interface (N<highlight><subscript>C</subscript></highlight>). These are characteristics that are all essential contact requirements for CMOS devices scaled down to 150 nm node. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The present invention has applications to metal gates, dual work function devices, dual gate devices, SOI devices (both fully depleted and partially depleted), and DRAM devices having CB and CS combined together using SAC process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
