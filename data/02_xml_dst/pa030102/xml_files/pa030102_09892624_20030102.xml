<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A conventional tool box is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and generally includes a base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and a cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> which is pivotally connected to the base <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A decoration portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed on the outside of the cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so as to be seen by people. The decoration portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> often is used to illustrate trademarks or special meaning for the tool box. In order to obtain a good looking of the tool box, the decoration portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be a sticker which is conveniently adhered on the cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The sticker may be made to have different version and colors so that it can be changed accordingly practical needs such as the color of the cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. However, the patterns on the sticker are easily to be worn off and this is concerned by the users or the manufacturers. The other way to obtain the decoration portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is to make the patterns of the decoration portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to be a one-piece member by using special plastic mold injection techniques. The techniques allows to inject two different colors of material into a mold so as to have the cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> involving two different colors. This costs too much and cannot meet commercial purposes. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the tool box of the present invention comprises a first part <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which is the base and a second part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is a cover pivotally connected to the first part <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. A plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are defined through the second part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the apertures <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are shaped to be desired patterns. A recessed area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is defined in an inside of the second part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and communicates with the apertures <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The peripheries defining the apertures <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> become a shoulder or step portion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A decoration plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is engaged with an inside of the second part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a plurality of protrusions <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> extend from the decoration plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The decoration plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is engaged with the recessed area <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the protrusions <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are engaged with the apertures <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and can be visible from outside of the second part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The decoration plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> contacts the shoulder or step portion so that it is positioned. The way to secure the decoration plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the second part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be a snap-fit or other known methods which are familiar to the person in the art. The decoration plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be easily made to have desired color and patterns, and the decoration plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is conveniently replaced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> While we have shown and described the embodiment in accordance with the present invention, it should be clear to those skilled in the art that further embodiments may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
