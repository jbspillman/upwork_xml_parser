<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> As technology scaling continues, transistors are producing more and more leakage current which effects power consumption. This is particularly important for mobile processing units (such as a portable computer) in which there is a limited amount of power available. Furthermore, leakage power takes a significant portion of a total power budget for a mobile processing unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Leakage current is especially a problem at higher temperatures. Leakage current may be managed based on standby leakage when a chip or processing unit is in an idle state and the temperature is not that high. However, leakage current in an active state may be much worse since the chip temperature may be very high causing the transistors to leak more. For example, a sub threshold leakage of a metal-oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) may be increased up to ten times when the temperature is raised from room temperature to 100&deg; Celsius. It is therefore extremely desirable to control active leakage current in low-power mobile processing units. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description, like reference numerals and characters may be used to designate identical, corresponding or similar components in differing figure drawings. Further, in the detailed description to follow, example sizes/models/values/ranges may be given, although the present invention is not limited to the same. With regard to the description of any signals, the terms HIGH and LOW may be used in an intended generic sense. The state of these signals may be easily reversed by a change in logic. Additionally, well known power/ground connections to integrated circuits (ICs) and other components may not be shown within the FIGS. for simplicity of illustration and discussion, and so as not to obscure the invention. Further, arrangements may be shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the invention, and also in view of the fact that specifics with respect to implementation of such block diagram arrangements may be highly dependent upon the platform within which the present invention is to be implemented. That is, such specifics should be well within the knowledge of one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention relate to a method and mechanism for reducing leakage current in a chip (such as a processing unit). The method may include determining whether a functional block is in either an inactive state (or inactive mode) or an active state (or active mode). The leakage current of the functional block may be reduced when the functional block is in the inactive state. The leakage current may be reduced by turning OFF a sleeping transistor that is associated with the functional block. Additionally, the leakage current may be reduced by applying a reverse body bias to a substrate associated with the functional block. In this manner, the leakage power may be dynamically controlled during operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention are also applicable to dynamic leakage control. This may be accomplished by dividing a chip into segments and individually controlling each segment based on a mode or state (such as a sleep mode or an active mode). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> More specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a chip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of a processing unit, for example. Other arrangements of the chip are also possible. In this example, the chip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may include a large number of electronic devices (or components) such as transistors. The electronic devices are not shown for ease of illustration. The chip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may include a plurality of blocks such as a block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a block <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a block <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a block <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be classified based on their functionality or other means to distinguish them. That is, each block may be considered a separate functional unit block (FUB). For example, the chip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be partitioned into different functionalities such as a floating point unit block and an integer execution unit block. Although not shown, each of the blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may surround a plurality of electronic devices on the chip <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> capable of operating (i.e., functioning) on their own such that each block surrounds a self contained system. Embodiments of the present invention will be described with respect to different functional blocks although embodiments of the present invention are also applicable to the blocks being distinguished for other reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates sleeping transistors that may be used to control leakage currents of the functional blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> according to an example embodiment of the present invention. Other embodiments and configurations are also within the scope of the present invention. More specifically, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a sleeping transistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> coupled between the functional block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and ground, a sleeping transistor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> coupled between the functional block <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and ground, a sleeping transistor <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> coupled between the functional block <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and ground and a sleeping transistor <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> coupled between the functional block <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and ground. Each of the sleeping transistors <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> may operate (i.e., turn ON or OFF) based on a leakage control signal applied to a gate of each transistor. Each leakage control signal may control whether its respective sleeping transistor is turned ON or turned OFF. The turning ON or the turning OFF of each of the sleeping transistors <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> may be based on whether each of the respective functional blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in an active state or in an inactive state. Embodiments of the present invention are also applicable to the determination of whether each of the functional blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will be in an active state or an inactive state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> When the functional block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is in an active state, then the sleeping transistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be ON (or turned ON) so that the functional block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be coupled to ground. However, if the functional block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is in an inactive state, then the sleeping transistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be OFF (or turned OFF) such that the functional block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not directly coupled to true ground (but rather may be at a virtual ground). Accordingly, the leakage current from the functional block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will not be able to travel to ground as easily as compared to when the sleeping transistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is ON. This will thereby reduce the leakage current associated with the functional block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In operation, each of the functional blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> will be separately controlled based on the leakage control signal applied to the sleeping transistors <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, respectively. Each of the functional blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be (or will be) in a different state and therefore each of the functional blocks may be separately controlled. That is, the block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be in an inactive state while the block <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be in an active state. Thus, the leakage control signal applied to the sleeping transistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be different from the leakage control signal applied to the sleeping transistor <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the sleeping transistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> coupled to the functional block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> according to an example embodiment of the present invention. Other embodiments and configurations are also within the scope of the present invention. In particular, other types of transistors or transistor-like devices are also applicable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows that the sleeping transistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> has a drain <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> coupled to the functional block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a source <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> coupled to ground and a gate <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> coupled to a leakage control device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (or voltage controlling device) by a leakage control signal <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment of the present invention, each of the blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be associated with a separate leakage control device and separate leakage control signal such as the leakage control device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the leakage control signal <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment of the present invention, each of the blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be coupled to the same leakage control device that may individually control or be associated with each of the functional blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by separate leakage control signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When the transistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is in an ON state, then both leakage and active current may flow from the functional block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through the transistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to the ground. This thereby couples the functional block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to ground. However, when the transistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is in the OFF state, then the current may not flow as easily through the transistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> to the ground (since the transistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is OFF). That is, the functional block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is not directly coupled to ground. The ON/OFF state of the sleeping transistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is based on the leakage control signal <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> output from the leakage control device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to the gate <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the sleeping transistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. In operation, an operating system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) may determine (or know) whether each of the functional blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in an active state or in an inactive state. The operating system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may provide an indication to each of the leakage control blocks to thereby control the signals that are output to the gates of each of the sleeping transistors <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the operating system <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may provide an indication signal on a signal line <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight> to the leakage control device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The leakage control device <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may thereby output the leakage control signal <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to the gate <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> of the transistor <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. A state of the leakage control signal <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may control whether the transistor is turned ON or OFF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, a sleeping transistor may be coupled to each individual functional block. Each of the sleeping transistors may be controlled (i.e., turned ON/OFF) based on a leakage control (block enabling) signal. When a block is in an active state or will be in an active state, then the respective sleeping transistor may be turned ON to provide normal operation. However, when the block is in an inactive state or will be in an inactive state, then the respective sleeping transistor may be turned OFF to minimize leakage current from the block. The leakage reduction from an inactive functional block may be up to ten times the amount of leakage current. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates how body control may be applied to each functional block according to an example embodiment of the present invention. Other embodiments for performing body control are also within the scope of the present invention. In this embodiment, a reverse body bias may be applied to a substrate of each functional block. The application of the reverse body bias may reduce the overall leakage current of the respective functional block. In one embodiment, each functional block may be separately isolated within a separate well so that each functional block may be separately controlled although this is not necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the functional block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be controlled by applying (or varying) a leakage control signal on a signal line <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> coupled to a substrate associated with the functional block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The functional block <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be controlled by applying (or varying) a leakage control signal to a signal line <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> coupled to a substrate associated with the functional block <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The functional block <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may be controlled by applying (or varying) a leakage control signal to a signal line <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> coupled to a substrate associated with the functional block <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The functional block <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be controlled by applying (or varying) a leakage control signal to a signal line <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> coupled to a substrate associated with the functional block <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The leakage control signals applied on the signal lines <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> may be output from a single leakage control device (or a single voltage controlling device) or from a plurality of leakage control devices (or a plurality of voltage controlling devices). In this manner, each of the functional blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be individually controlled. As in the above embodiment, an operating system may provide an indication to each of the leakage control devices to thereby control the leakage control signals applied to the substrate of the respective functional blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an example p-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (PMOS) transistor in which body control may be applied according to an example embodiment of the present invention. Other embodiments and configurations are also within the scope of the present invention. In particular, the PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes a p substrate <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and an n well <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. The n well <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> includes a drain region <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> of p&plus; dopant, a gate region <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, a source region <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of p&plus; dopant and a body (or substrate) contact <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of n&plus; dopant. This configuration of PMOS transistors is well known to one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The source region <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may be coupled by a signal line <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to a voltage controlling device <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> and the body contact <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> may be coupled by a separate signal line <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> to the voltage controlling device <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. As such, a first signal may be applied along the signal line <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to the source region <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and a second signal may be applied along the signal line <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> to the body contact <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. Voltage levels of the signals on the signal lines <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> may be controlled based on the voltage controlling device <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, which may be further coupled to an operating system. As in the above described embodiment, the operating system may provide an indication to each of the leakage control devices to thereby control the signals on the signal lines <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight>. The voltage controlling device <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> may be coupled to other portions of the PMOS transistor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> although those other connections are not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> for ease of illustration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, a reverse body bias may be applied to the body contact <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> so as to alter the body bias of the transistor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. In a PMOS transistor under normal body bias, the n well <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> may be biased to VCC. This may be accomplished by applying a VCC bias to the body contact <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> and a VCC bias to the source region <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, for example. VCC may correspond to 1.8 volts although other values of VCC are also possible. However, for reverse body bias, the n well <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> may be biased to a voltage higher than VCC. Accordingly, when the operating system determines that the functional block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is (or will be) in an inactive state, then the operating system sends an indication to the voltage controlling device <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>. The voltage controlling device <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> may thereby adjust the voltage level of the signal on the signal line <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> such that a reverse body bias is applied to the transistor <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the voltage controlling device <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> may apply a signal of a voltage level VCC on the signal line <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> to the source region <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and a signal having a bias of more than VCC on the signal line <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> to the body contact <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the bias may be 500 millivolts more than VCC although other values of the bias are also within the scope of the present invention. Other means for applying reverse body bias to a PMOS transistor are also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention are also applicable to an n-channel metal-oxide semiconductor (NMOS) transistor. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates an example NMOS transistor in which body control may be applied according to an example embodiment of the present invention. Other embodiments and configurations are also within the scope of the present invention. In particular, the NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes an n substrate <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and a p well <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. The p well <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> includes a drain region <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> of n&plus; dopant, a gate region <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, a source region <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> of n&plus; dopant and a body (or substrate) contact <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> of n&plus; dopant. This configuration of NMOS transistors is well known to one skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The source region <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> may be coupled by a signal line <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> to a voltage controlling device <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> and the body contact <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> may be coupled by a separate signal line <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> to the voltage controlling device <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. As such, a first signal may be applied along the signal line <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> to the source region <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> and a second signal may be applied along the signal line <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> to the body contact <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. Voltage levels of the signals on the signal lines <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> may be controlled based on the voltage controlling device <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>, which may be further coupled to an operating system. As in the above described embodiment, the operating system may provide an indication to each of the leakage control devices to thereby control the signals on the signal lines <highlight><bold>526</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight>. The voltage controlling device <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> may be coupled to other portions of the NMOS transistor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> although those other connections are not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> for ease of illustration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, a reverse body bias may be applied to the body contact <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> so as to alter the body bias of the transistor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. In an NMOS transistor under normal body bias, the p well <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> may be biased to ground. This may be accomplished by applying a ground bias to the body contact <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> and a ground bias to the source region <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. However, for reverse body bias, the p well <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> may be biased to a voltage lower than ground. In order to apply a reverse body bias to the substrate, a slightly negative bias (i.e., more negative than ground) may be applied to the substrate using the body contact <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, when the operating system determines that the functional block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is (or will be) in an inactive state, then the operating system may send an indication to the voltage controlling device <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight>. The voltage controlling device <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> may thereby adjust the voltage levels on the signal line <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> such that a reverse body bias is applied to the transistor <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the voltage controlling device <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> may apply a signal of a ground voltage on the signal line <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight> to the source region <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> and a signal having a bias of less than ground to the body contact <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the bias may be 500 millivolts less than ground although other values of the bias are also within the scope of the present invention. Other means for applying a reverse body bias to an NMOS transistor are also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> embodiment, a signal may be applied (or varied) along the signal line <highlight><bold>422</bold></highlight> (corresponding to the signal line <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) to the body contact <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) so as to provide a reverse body bias or a normal body bias for a PMOS type of transistor. In the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> embodiment, a signal may be applied (or varied) along the signal line <highlight><bold>522</bold></highlight> (corresponding to the signal line <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) to the body contact <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> so as to provide a reverse body bias or a normal body bias for an NMOS type of transistor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Each of the functional blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be provided within their own separate well so that the substrate of each of the functional blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may be separately controlled. This may be accomplished using a twin well process as is well known in the art. Other techniques for isolating the respective functional blocks may also be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention may provide a method for reducing leakage current from functional blocks of a chip. This may involve determining whether a first functional block is in (or will be in) an inactive state and reducing the leakage current of the first functional block when the first functional block is determined to be in the inactive state. Reducing the leakage current may be accomplished by turning OFF a sleeping transistor associated with the first functional block or by applying a reverse body bias to a substrate associated with the first functional block. Still further, the method may also include determining whether a second functional block is in (or will be in) an inactive state and separately reducing the leakage current of the second functional block when the second functional block is determined to be in the inactive state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention may also provide an apparatus that includes a chip (having a first functional block and a second functional block), a first device (such as an operating system) and a second device (such as a leakage controlling device). The first device may determine whether the first functional block is in one of an inactive state and an active state. The second device may receive an indication from the first device indicative of whether the first functional block is in either the inactive state or the active state. The second device may further reduce the leakage current of the first functional block when the first functional block is determined to be in the inactive state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Any reference in the specification to &ldquo;one embodiment&rdquo;, &ldquo;an embodiment&rdquo;, &ldquo;example embodiment&rdquo;, etc., means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of such phrases in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with any embodiment, it is submitted that it is within the purview of one skilled in the art to effect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other ones of the embodiments. Furthermore, certain method procedures may have been delineated as separate procedures; however, these separately delineated procedures should not be construed as necessarily order dependent in their performance. That is, some procedures may be able to be performed in an alternative ordering, simultaneously, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with reference to a number of illustrative embodiments thereof, it should be understood that numerous other modifications and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art that will fall within the spirit and scope of the principles of this invention. More particularly, reasonable variations and modifications are possible in the component parts and/or arrangements of the subject combination arrangement within the scope of the foregoing disclosure, the drawings and the appended claims without departing from the spirit of the invention.
