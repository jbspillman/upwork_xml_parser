<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a portable communications device which includes a speaker and an antenna, particularly but not exclusively to a device having an antenna cavity which forms the audio cavity for a hands-free speaker. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The demand for new features in portable communications equipment, such as mobile telephones, continues to rise, while the size of these devices remains the same or is required to become even smaller. Some of these new features relate to the audio aspects of mobile telephones. For example, integrated hands-free devices require a significant improvement in speaker quality compared with the earphone speaker arrangement provided in conventional mobile telephones. Similarly, an improvement in speaker quality is required as mobile telephone speakers are increasingly used to play polyphonic ring-tones, downloaded midi files, FM radio and so on. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> An increase in speaker performance can be brought about by the use of an audio cavity, in much the same way as a conventional audio system loudspeaker requires a speaker enclosure. However, an audio cavity inevitably takes up space within the body of the telephone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One of the objects of the present invention is to improve the usage of space within a portable communications device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, there is provided a portable communications device including a speaker and an antenna, the antenna being associated with an antenna cavity which is arranged to form an audio cavity for the speaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> By sharing the volume which results from the presence of an antenna, for example in an internal antenna arrangement, with the speaker, the need for a separate audio cavity is removed, so saving space and allowing the overall size of the device to be minimised, without adverse effects on audio performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The antenna can be a patch antenna, for example a planar inverted-F antenna having a radiating conductor and a ground plane, the antenna cavity resulting from the required separation between the radiating conductor and the ground plane. Alternatively, the antenna can be a planar or meander antenna having a radiating conductor but not using a ground plane, the antenna cavity resulting from the need to avoid metallic objects in the vicinity of the radiating conductor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The speaker can be located outside the antenna cavity and coupled to the cavity, for example by an audio duct. By locating the speaker outside the antenna cavity, adverse effects on antenna performance, caused by metal components in the speaker, can be avoided, while still making effective use of the antenna cavity as an audio cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, there is also provided a portable communications device including a speaker and an antenna, said antenna forming an antenna cavity within said device, said device including an audio cavity for the speaker, wherein the audio cavity and the antenna cavity are shared by said speaker and said antenna. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The invention further provides an antenna module for a portable communications device, said device including a housing portion and said antenna module including an antenna and an audio outlet for a speaker, the module being configured such that, when it is connected to said housing portion of the device, a sealed cavity is formed which comprises an audio cavity for a speaker mounted to the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, there is still further provided a method of assembling a portable communications device, the device comprising a housing, a speaker and an antenna module including an antenna, the method comprising the steps of mounting the speaker to the housing and mounting the antenna module to the housing to form a sealed volume between the antenna and the housing, said sealed volume including the speaker and said sealed volume comprising an audio cavity.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a mobile station in the form of a mobile telephone handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a microphone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, keypad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a hands-free mode selection key <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an LCD display <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, an earphone speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a hands-free speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and an internal antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. The location of the hands-free speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, which shows the back of the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a rear cover (not shown) removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The back of the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises a chassis <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> having a recessed portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for receiving an antenna module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The recessed portion includes a speaker clip arrangement <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for receiving the hands-free speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The recessed portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a lip <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, so that when the antenna module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is fitted to the chassis <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the recessed portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and antenna module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> form a sealed cavity between them, which will be described in more detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The antenna module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises an integrally moulded plastic substrate <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with an antenna pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> plated onto it to form part of the antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, for example by using the moulded interconnect device (MID) moulding process. A feed duct <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on the chassis mates with a corresponding outlet <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the antenna module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to permit the antenna to be connected to the PCB <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which is mounted to the underside of the chassis <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The antenna module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> also includes an integrally moulded audio outlet <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> for the hands-free speaker <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The antenna module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is assembled to the chassis <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> by clipping the speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> into the speaker clip arrangement <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and fitting the antenna module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> onto the recessed portion <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In an alternative embodiment, there is a speaker clip arrangement in the antenna module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is clipped into the antenna module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> prior to assembly to the chassis <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The mobile station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is operable to communicate through cellular radio links with individual PLMNs (public land mobile network) shown schematically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> as PLMN A, for example a GSM 1800 MHz network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the major circuit components of the telephone handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Signal processing is carried out under the control of a digital micro-controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which has an associated flash memory <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Electrical analogue audio signals are produced by microphone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and amplified by pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Similarly, analogue audio signals are fed to the earphone speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> through an amplifier <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or to the hands-free speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> through an amplifier <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, depending on which speaker is selected. The micro-controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receives instruction signals from the keypad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and hands-free mode selection key <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and controls operation of the LCD display <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The hands-free mode selection key <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is used to instruct the micro-controller <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to switch between the earphone and hands-free speakers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Information concerning the identity of the user is held on a smart card <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the form of a GSM SIM card which contains the usual GSM international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) and an encryption key K<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>that is used for encoding the radio transmission in a manner well known per se. The SIM card is removably received in a SIM card reader <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The mobile telephone circuitry includes a codec <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and an rf stage <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> feeding the antenna <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a simplified cross-sectional view of the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> along the line A-A&prime; in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, not showing the speaker clip arrangement or other incidental details. When the antenna module <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is assembled to the chassis <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a cavity <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is formed, which acts as an audio cavity for the speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, in this case a sealed back volume. A common or shared antenna and audio cavity is therefore provided. To avoid adverse effects on antenna operation caused by metal components within the hands-free speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the speaker is not mounted directly underneath the antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, but adjacent to it. The antenna pattern <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> together with a ground plane <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> formed by the PCB, together form the antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which is known as a patch antenna and more specifically a planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates the general configuration of an antenna of the PIFA type, comprising a radiating conductive plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> mounted on a dielectric support <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a ground plane <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, for example the PCB to which the handset components are mounted or the surface of the RF screening cans mounted to the PCB. For correct operation, a separation of around 6-7 mm is required between the conductive plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the ground plane <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Therefore, with a typical dielectric thickness of 1 mm, the gap of 5-6 mm between the dielectric <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the ground plane <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is available to be used as an audio cavity <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The smaller cavity <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> above the speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> acts as a duct to port the audio signal into the larger audio cavity <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> between the antenna plates <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Many different types of internal antenna are suitable to implement the invention, including plate antennas and meander type antennas, three examples of which are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. A meander type antenna comprises an antenna element <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> arranged within a handset casing <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> in such a way that the handset PCB <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> does not act as a ground plane for the antenna. With this type of antenna, it is therefore important that there are no metallic components within the casing beneath the antenna element, since such elements would act as a ground plane and affect antenna operation. This makes the space beneath the antenna element suitable for use as an audio cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A meander antenna arrangement analogous to the PIFA antenna arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, comprising an antenna pattern <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> above an audio cavity <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a speaker arrangement in a telephone handset <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in which a speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is mounted against a battery <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. An audio outlet <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is located so that an audio cavity <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> beneath an antenna <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> forms a front volume for the speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, rather than a back volume. In alternative embodiments, combined front and back volumes are envisaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The various alternative embodiments described are not intended to be limiting; the particular arrangement used in any case by which the audio and antenna cavities are shared depends on the layout and requirements of the particular communications device in question. For example, in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> can be separated from the antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and an audio duct <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> used to port the audio signal to the antenna/audio cavity <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. In a further embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, the speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is located in the centre of a plate antenna, with active antenna elements <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> surrounding it, over an antenna/audio cavity <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
