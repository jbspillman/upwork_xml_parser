<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">An electronic display such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) is disclosed. The display includes a substrate layer, a light source and a lightguide for directing light emitted from the light source into the display, wherein the lightguide is integrally formed with the substrate layer. A mobile telecommunications device incorporating the display according to the invention is also disclosed. As the lightguide and substrate layer are formed together, the display is thinner than known displays so the telecommunications device can be made smaller or more space provided for other components. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to electronic displays such as liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and more specifically to thin film LCDs made from plastic. The invention also applies to any type of electronic display that requires a frontlight. For example, other types of LCD&apos;s including cholesteric, electrophoretic, passive TN and STN type LCDs with internal polarisers and active LCDs with internal polarisers. Another type of electronic display to which the invention may also apply is Interference Modulation (IMOD) displays which is made up of many thin film very small reflecting elements which can be moved to generate optical interference. The invention may also apply to saturated particle displays, electrochrornic displays, electrophoretic and rotating ball displays. The present invention also relates to a mobile telecommunications device, such as a mobile telephone, incorporating an electronic display according to the invention. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> LCDs are well known and generally comprise a digital or alphanumeric display consisting of liquid crystal material sealed between two supporting sheets of plastic or glass. A thin transparent film of conductive material such as a transparent metal oxide film is applied to the surface of each supporting sheet facing the liquid crystal material and the conductive film on one sheet is etched into character forming segments, each having electrical leads extending towards the edge of the sheet for connection to driving circuitry, which controls the voltage applied to various areas of the display, and a power supply such as a battery. A polarising filter sandwiched between two transparent substrate layers is also disposed on the outer surface of each supporting sheet with their planes of polarisation oriented at right angles to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The most common LCD is called a twisted nematic (TN) display. Another type of LCD is called super twisted nematic (STN) display. Both types employ a nematic liquid crystal. A polymer alignment layer is applied to the conductive film on each supporting sheet facing the nematic liquid crystal and is rubbed to create a series of parallel microscopic grooves in the surface of the film which are oriented in the same direction as the plane of polarisation of the polarising filter disposed on each supporting sheet. These grooves ensure that the first layer of molecules of the liquid crystal are aligned with their longitudinal axes parallel to the grooves. Each successive layer of molecules gradually twists until the furthest layer is at an angle (90 degrees in twisted nematic displays) to the first layer and so that the outermost molecules contacting each supporting sheet are matched with the plane of polarisation of the polarisation filters on that sheet. The LCD also includes a sheet of reflective material on its back surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When there is no voltage applied between the conductive films, light striking one of the polarisation filters is polarised and the successive layers of molecules guides the polarised light they receive to the next molecular layer. When the polarised light has transversed the liquid crystal and guided through an angle of 90 degrees, it passes through the second polarising filter and is subsequently reflected back off the reflective surface placed behind it. The reflected light is guided back through the crystal along the same path and emerges in the same place that it struck the first polarisation filter. When an electric charge is applied to a region of the liquid crystal molecules, the orderly twisted arrangement of the molecules in that region is disrupted and the molecules untwist. This changes the angle of the light passing through them so that it no longer matches the angle of the polarising filter preventing the light from passing back out of that region of the LCD, making it darker than the surrounding areas. The region to which a voltage is applied is normally one or more of the character forming segments or pixels. By applying current to different character forming segments or pixels simultaneously, a recognisable character or numeral can be generated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The polarising filter is formed from a chemical compound composed of molecules that naturally align in parallel relation to one another so that they create a microscopic filter that blocks any light not matching their alignment. The light passing through the polarising filter between the substrate sheets is thereby polarised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When the display is viewed in daylight, it can be illuminated using the available ambient light. However, at night or when the ambient light level is low, the display maybe illuminated by one or more light sources located around the periphery of a frontlight which is a planar sheet usually formed from plastic positioned above the display and comprising a lightguide having a number of parallel grooves etched in its upper surface to redirect light emitted by the light source toward the display. As the frontlight is a separate component from the display, a small air gap exists between them after assembly of the display and frontlight and so an anti-reflective coating is provided on its lower surface for reasons which will be described in more detail with reference to the prior art electronic display and frontlight illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An exploded view of the main components of a prior art electronic display <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and frontlight <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and it will be seen that the display <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> comprises an active layer, such as a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, sandwiched between a pair of plastic optically non-birefringent front and rear supporting layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A thin transparent film (not shown) of conductive material is applied to the back surface of front supporting layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>facing the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which is then etched to form character segments (not shown). A second transparent conductive film (not shown) is applied to the surface of the rear supporting <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>facing the liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Each film is treated with a polymer alignment layer (not shown) which is rubbed to form a series of parallel microscopic grooves. A polarising filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is then positioned over each of the plastic supporting layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with their planes of polarisation oriented at right angles to each other and so that the plane of polarisation of each filter corresponds to the grooves formed in its adjacent supporting layer. A pair of substrate layers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>sandwich each polarising filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, respectively. A reflective layer (not shown) is also located on the back of the LCD behind polarising filter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The frontlight <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is located above the LCD <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> parallel to and spaced from the substrate layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the polarising filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. As the frontlight <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is a separate component to the display <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a small air gap <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> will always be present between them even if the frontlight <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is directly assembled on the display. The frontlight <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> comprises a light guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> formed from a transparent plastic sheet in which has been cut a series of spaced parallel grooves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in its upper surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and an antireflective coating <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> disposed on its lower surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A light source <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is located adjacent to the periphery of the light guide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Light emitted by the light source <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is directed toward the display <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> by the grooves <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to illuminate it. The antireflective coating <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is required because incoming light entering the frontlight in the direction of arrow A in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> strikes the rear surface of the frontlight <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and most of it is transmitted toward the display <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> in the direction of arrow B. However, some of the light is reflected in the direction shown by arrow C due to the differences in the refractive index between the material from which the frontlight <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is made and the air through which the light must pass before it enters the display <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This reflected light is &ldquo;wasted&rdquo; because it does not illuminate the display <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which consequently appears darker. The reflected light also makes the display <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> harder to read. A second anti-reflective coating (not shown) may be provided on the top surface of the display <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> between the display <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the frontlight and/or on the upper surface <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the frontlight <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> to reduce reflection of light in the direction of arrow D and E respectively as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to manufacture electronic displays and front lights which are as thin as possible so that they do not take up too much space in the housing of an electronic device in which they are used, especially when size constraints are important, as in the case of mobile telephones. If the electronic display and front light can be made thinner, a corresponding reduction in thickness of the mobile telephone housing can be realised or more space is made available for other components. It is also desirable to reduce manufacturing costs wherever possible without compromising the quality of the device. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the accompanying drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> An electronic display <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> according to the invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> from which it can be seen that it comprises an active layer, such as a liquid crystal layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> sandwiched between a pair of plastic optically non-birefringent front and rear supporting layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. A polarising filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is positioned over each of the plastic supporting layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, and a pair of substrate layers <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>sandwich polarising filter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> as described with reference to the prior art arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. However, in the embodiment of the invention, the substrate layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is present between the polarising filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the front supporting layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>but substrate layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>has been omitted. Instead, the lower surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the lightguide <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> has been directly mounted to the polarising filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The invention therefore combines the substrate layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the display and the lightguide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the prior art to form an integrated single component. It will also be apparent that because the lightguide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and display <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> have been integrated, there is no longer an air gap and so no need for an anti-reflective coating on the lightguide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> because there is no optical interface between the lightguide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the display <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which is required for reflection to occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The integral lightguide <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and display <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provides the advantage that the overall thickness of a standard display and separate frontlight is reduced and it is also cheaper and easier to manufacture as there is no longer a requirement for an antireflective coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment of the present invention will now be described, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The electronic display of this embodiment is essentially the same as in the first embodiment described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. However, the thickness of the display is further reduced by combining the substrate layer <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with the supporting layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and by combining the substrate layer <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>with the supporting layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. More specifically, polarising filter <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and the active layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> share a common substrate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and polarising filter <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the active layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> share a common substrate <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. As the two separate optically non birefringent plastic supporting layers <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and substrate layers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are no longer required, the electronic display is cheaper to manufacture in addition to being thinner than an electronic display and combined lightguide according to the first embodiment or substantially thinner than a prior art electronic display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A mobile telephone incorporating an electronic display according to the invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The telephone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a front and rear face <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The front face <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is provided with a user interface having a keypad <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a display <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> formed from the electronic display of the invention, an ear piece <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, a microphone <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and an on/off key <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. The telephone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be adapted for communication via a wireless telecommunications network, e.g. a cellular network. However, the telephone <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> could also be designed for a cordless network. The keypad <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> has a first group of keys <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which are alphanumeric and by means of which a use can enter a telephone number, write a text message (SMS) or write a name associated with a particular number, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The keypad <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> additionally includes two soft keys <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, the functionality of which depends on the state of the telephone and the navigation in the menu by means of a navigation key <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, and two call handling keys <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which can be used for establishing a call or a conference call, terminating a call or rejecting an incoming call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Many modifications and variations of the invention falling within the terms of the following claims will be apparent to those skilled in the art and the foregoing description should be regarded as a description of the preferred embodiments only. For example, the electronic display of the invention may be installed in apparatus other than a mobile telephone, such as a personal digital assistant (PDA). </paragraph>
