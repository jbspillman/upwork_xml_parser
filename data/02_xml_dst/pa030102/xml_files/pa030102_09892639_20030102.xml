<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is well-known in the art for landline telephone handsets to be supplied with a coil speaker or a coil to provide inductive coupling to hearing aids. By switching to a &ldquo;tele-coil&rdquo; or &ldquo;T-&rdquo; mode of operation, a hearing aid is able to detect a magnetic signal generated by the coil speaker or coil. The hearing aid converts the magnetic signal into an acoustic signal for the user of the hearing aid to hear. The coil speaker or coil is positioned in such a way that the handset can be held in a conventional manner. Thus, inductive coupling provides an alternative or additional way of communicating an audio signal to the user. It is especially useful when the telephone handset is being used in a noisy environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is also known to supply mobile telephone handsets, which are also known as cellular telephone handsets, with an induction coil to provide inductive coupling to hearing aids. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,991,420 describes a battery pack for a mobile telephone handset having a built-in induction coil. In another instance, EP-A0789474 discloses a hands-free arrangement in which an induction loop is worn around a user&apos;s neck and plugged into the handset. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention seeks to provide an improved induction coil arrangement. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> mobile telephone handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided with front and back covers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which cover front and back faces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The front and back covers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are releasably attachable to the front and back faces <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and are secured by deformable catches (not shown) in a well-known manner. It will be appreciated that the front and back covers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> need not totally encase the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. For example, further covers may be provided which are integrally formed with the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be provided such that only the front cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is releasably attachable. Moreover, the front and back covers <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be releasably attachable to each over, rather than to the handset itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> houses a circuit board <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a system connector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, a cover connector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, a battery <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, a liquid crystal display (LCD) panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a microphone <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a speaker <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a keypad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, an internal antenna <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a subscriber identification module (SIM) card <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and a SIM card reader <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The circuit board <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> carries mobile telephone circuitry including a radio interface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, a coder/decoder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a controller <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and memory <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The circuit board <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is connected to the system connector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> which permits expansion of mobile telephone handset functionality, such as connection of a hands-free communication kit. The circuit board <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is also connected to a cover connector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, which is similar to the system connector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and whose function is described in more detail hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the front cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> comprises an injected-moulded shell <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> formed of a plastics material, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, and provided with a plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When the front cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is attached to the front face <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the apertures <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are aligned with components provided on the front face <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, such as the LCD panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the keypad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Thus, the keypad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> projects through keypad apertures <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and so allows the user to operate the keypad <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A display aperture <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is positioned over the LCD panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and is provided with a clear plastics window <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to permit the LCD panel <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be viewed. Microphone and speaker apertures <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> sit over the microphone <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and speaker <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> respectively. These apertures <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> facilitate passage of acoustic signals through the front cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The front cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also comprises an induction coil <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> for generating a magnetic field signal for a hearing aid (not shown) which is provided with a pick-up coil. Such a hearing aid is well-known in the art. The pick-up coil is used to enable the hearing aid to operate in a &ldquo;tele-coil&rdquo; or &ldquo;T-&rdquo; mode. An example of a T-mode compatible hearing aid is an Oticon Personic 440. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The induction coil <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of turns of wire, such as enamelled copper, encased in plastics material. The induction coil <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is mounted to a handset-facing surface <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the front cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and is centred about the speaker aperture <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The number of turns of wire, the gauge of the wire, the area of the coil and the arrangement of the coil in order to generate a sufficient magnetic field can be determined by routine experimental methods. Preferably, for a &minus;10 dbV signal at 1 kHz, a minimum axial magnetic field should be &minus;22 dBA/m and a minimum radial field should be &minus;27 dBA/m. The resistance of the coil is typically about 30Q. However, it will be appreciated that other design criteria may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The front cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> also comprises an amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for driving the induction coil <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a connector <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for engaging the cover connector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> and receiving an audio signal from the coder/decoder <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and power from the battery <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. The amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is mounted to the handset-facing surface <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the front cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> next to the induction coil <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The connector <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> comprises first, second and third pins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The first pin <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is for receiving the audio signal which is usually referred to as a transmitted audio signal XEAR. The second pin <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is for receiving a supply voltage VDC. The third pin <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for connection to ground GND. The front cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be provided with an additional battery for powering the amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the induction coil <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> comprises an operational amplifier <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, such as an LM 386, powered by the supply voltage VDC through a diode <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and connected to ground GND. The supply voltage VDC is stabilised by a capacitor <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. In this example, the capacitor has a value of 0.05 &mgr;F. The transmitted audio signal XEAR is channelled into the input of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> through a variable resistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which provides gain control. In this example, the variable resistor has a maximum value of 5 kQ. A resistor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> connects the input and output of the operational amplifier <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. In this example the resistor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> has a value of 5 k&OHgr;. The amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be modified in many ways. For example, a different operational amplifier <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> may be used and the electrical components <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> may have different values. The variable resistor may be controlled by the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> using a control line provided through an additional pin (not shown) of the connector <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, a control circuit may also be provided for switching on and off the amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Other amplifier circuits may used which provide amplification of the audio signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the pins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the connector <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> depend from the handset-facing surface <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and are positioned to engage first, second and third pads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the cover connector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> disposed on the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Thus, when the front cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is attached to the front face <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the pins <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the connector <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> press against the pads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the cover connector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Therefore, when the front cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is attached to the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the induction coil <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and connector <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is electrically connected to the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the connector <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is hidden. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is configured to detect when the front cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is attached, for example by measuring the bias of the second pad <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> which supplies VDC. The controller <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can modify operation of the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> accordingly, such as permitting the user to control gain of the amplifier <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The invention has several advantages. A large proportion of the population do not suffer from impaired hearing. Therefore, they do not wear a hearing aid and do not require a mobile telephone handset having an induction loop. The invention allows standard handsets to be sold without substantial modification. If a user does require the handset to have an induction coil, then they simply remove any existing front cover, if one is in place, and attach a front cover according to the present invention. Furthermore, front covers are perceived by the public to be a style or fashion item. Users can attach covers which reflect their tastes and personalities. Users of hearing aids can engage in such an activity and so minimise their own&mdash;and society&apos;s&mdash;negative perception of hearing impairment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the connector <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> may be replaced by an alternative connector <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for connection with the system connector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the system connector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is not located on the front face <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> but on a face underneath. The alternative connector <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is connected to the amplifier circuit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> by means of a flexible cable <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which passes through a connector aperture <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in the cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The front cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is attached to the front face <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the alternative connector <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is inserted into the system connector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. In this arrangement, the cover connector <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> is not needed and can be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the alternative connector <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> may be integrally formed with the front cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to form a rigid connector <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&prime;. The rigid connector <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>&prime; is arranged such that when the front cover <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is attached to the front face <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, it engages the system connector <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that many modifications may be made to the embodiments described above. For example, any portable handheld electronic device which has interchangeable cover and which generates an audio signal, for example a radio or a music player, can use the cover with an induction loop. </paragraph>
