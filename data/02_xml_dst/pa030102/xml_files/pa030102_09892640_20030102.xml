<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the field of speakers, particularly but not exclusively to a dual diaphragm piezo-electric speaker for an integrated hands-free portable communications device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Integrated hands free (IHF) handsets are a relatively recent development in mobile telephone technology. As such handsets become lighter and more compact, there is an ever-increasing requirement for the size and weight of speakers to be reduced and for quality to be increased. This is especially so as speakers are used for polyphonic ringer melodies, downloaded midi music files, text-to-speech conversion, FM radio and so on. Efficiency is also an issue when trying to maximise talk time with IHF speech. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Many different types of speaker are known, including a single diaphragm gas filled piezo-electric dome speaker, for example the Audax HD-3P. Such speakers are prone to non-linearities and even harmonic distortion, for example due to the outward excursion of the speaker diaphragm being less than the inwards excursion for a given voltage. A single diaphragm speaker also suffers from the drawback that the gas acts as a non-linear spring, providing a stiffness which varies with volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention aims to address the above problems. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, there is provided a speaker comprising first and second diaphragms arranged to be driven in opposite phase with respect to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Advantageously, the dual diaphragm arrangement provides for the cancellation of even harmonic distortion since the harmonic distortion produced by the expansion of one diaphragm is cancelled by the corresponding contraction of the other and vice-versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The speaker can be transparent and can be arranged to be located over the display, so that the display is visible through the speaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The invention also provides an electronic device including a display and a transparent speaker, the speaker being mounted in front of the display so that the display is visible through the speaker. The speaker can be any transparent speaker, including single diaphragm and dual diaphragm piezoelectric speakers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As mobile devices perform more visual functions such as photography, GPS location, web browsing, personal digital assistance and so on, the display is likely to take up more of the available space, with consequential requirements on the speaker to be as small as possible. However, small speaker diaphragms have to move a greater distance than large ones to produce a given sound pressure level, which leads to greater distortion. Small speakers are also less efficient, which reduces talk time. By providing a transparent speaker which can be as large as the display area, a better quality speaker can be produced while minimising the demands on space within the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to the invention, there is further provided a speaker comprising first and second opposed diaphragms, the diaphragms being arranged to be driven so that, in use, they move in the same direction with respect to one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The space between the diaphragms can be filled with a gas having a large molecular size, to prevent leakage. Since the volume of gas between the diaphragms remains substantially constant as they move in the same direction, this removes a potential source of non-linearity with respect to a speaker in which a single diaphragm moves relative to a fixed backplate. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a mobile station in the form of a mobile telephone handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a microphone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, keypad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, with a hands-free mode selection key <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, an LCD display <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, an earphone speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a hands-free speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and an internal antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> (not shown). The hands-free speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is a transparent speaker located between the display <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, which is mounted to the handset&apos;s PCB <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, and the front cover of the handset <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The space <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> between the speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the display <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> acts as an acoustic cavity and can include a reflex port (not shown), for example to improve performance for mid-range use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The mobile station <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is operable to communicate through cellular radio links with individual PLMNs (public land mobile network) shown schematically as PLMN A, for example a GSM 1800 MHz network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the major circuit components of the telephone handset <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Signal processing is carried out under the control of a digital micro-controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which has an associated flash memory <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Electrical analogue audio signals are produced by microphone <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and amplified by pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Similarly, analogue audio signals are fed to the speakers <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> through respective amplifiers <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The amplifier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for the hands-free speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is, for example, a digital class D amplifier. The micro-controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> receives instruction signals from the keypad <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and hands-free mode selection key <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and controls operation of the LCD display <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. The hands-free mode selection key <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is used to instruct the micro-controller <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to switch between the earphone speaker <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the hands-free speaker <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Information concerning the identity of the user is held on a smart card <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the form of a GSM SIM card which contains the usual GSM international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) and an encryption key K<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>that is used for encoding the radio transmission in a manner well known per se. The SIM card is removably received in a SIM card reader <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The mobile telephone circuitry includes a codec <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and an rf stage <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> feeding the antenna <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, a dual diaphragm speaker <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> according to the invention comprises first and second diaphragms <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> mounted to an insulating support frame <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Each diaphragm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> comprises a transparent piezo-electric polymer film <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, for example a 6 &mgr;m thick film of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), which is coated on its inner and outer surfaces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> with a transparent conductive material, for example indium tin oxide (ITO), to form inner and outer electrodes. The cavity <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> between the diaphragms <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is filled with a gas with a large molecular size, to prevent it escaping through the diaphragms, for example, sulphur tetrafluoride SF<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>. The gas pressure is arranged to keep the diaphragms in tension, so that they form a dual dome shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The inner and outer electrodes <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of each diaphragm are connected to the output of the amplifier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> so that a first input terminal <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is connected to the outer coating <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an inner coating <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, while a second input terminal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected to the inner coating <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and an outer coating <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The operation of the dual diaphragm speaker will now be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5, 6</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. When a driving voltage of a first, for example, a positive polarity is applied to the input terminals <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from the amplifier <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> contracts as a result of the piezo-electric effect. At the same time, as a result of the electrode connections described above, the polarity of the electrodes <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are reversed with respect to those of the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The second diaphragm <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> therefore expands as a result of the piezo-electric effect. The result is that both diaphragms move in the same direction, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Similarly, when the opposite polarity is applied to the input terminals <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the first diaphragm <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> elongates and the second diaphragm <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> contracts, so that both diaphragms again move in the same direction, being the opposite direction to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Therefore, as described in detail above, when the diaphragms <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are driven in opposite phase, both move in the same direction like a single diaphragm. As a result of the push-pull configuration, non-linearities due to the amount of expansion being greater or less than the amount of shrinkage for a given voltage, are effectively cancelled. Furthermore, the volume of gas between the diaphragms <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> stays substantially constant during the excursions of the diaphragms, so that the tension of the diaphragms remains substantially constant. This removes another potential source of non-linearity with respect to a single diaphragm speaker. Since the volume of gas remains approximately the same during diaphragm excursions, the gas provides no stiffness, so that the speaker has a lower resonant frequency than a corresponding single diaphragm speaker and can be used over a wider frequency range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been primarily described with reference to a dual diaphragm speaker, other types of speaker can be mounted in front of the display <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of a portable electronic device such as a mobile telephone or portable digital assistant, as long as they enable the display to be viewed through the speaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated by the skilled person that the speaker need not be limited to the rectangular shape and dimensions illustrated, but can be in the form of a convex lens or any other size or shape which is required to fit a particular device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> While the invention has primarily been described for use in a mobile telephone, it is also suitable for other types of portable electronic devices as well as for non-portable devices such as domestic speakers. </paragraph>
