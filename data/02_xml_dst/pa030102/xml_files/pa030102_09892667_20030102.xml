<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a security system, and more particularly, relates to a radio location based theft recovery mechanism for an electronic device such as a mobile PC equipped with a radio-frequency (RF) locator subsystem for providing security services of varying complexity, including enforcing security policies and obtaining location based information in order to report the location of a stolen device to a proper authority, for example, the police to track and recover the stolen device. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Electronics devices such as notebook and laptop computers, cellular telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and other computing devices have become increasingly compact and portable and, hence, increasingly vulnerable to unauthorized use, theft or loss. This is because these portable devices are small, expensive and may contain very valuable information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Many computers, especially portable computers (or mobile &ldquo;PCs&rdquo;), have been secured from unauthorized use, theft or loss by mechanisms based on principles of prevention, deterrence or recovery. Prevention mechanisms may include physical locking devices or cables which lock portable computers to docking stations. Deterrence mechanisms may include myriad alarm systems which employ various deterrence methods, including sound and visual alarms to deter an unauthorized person or a thief from stealing the portable computers. Recovery mechanisms may include various systems for locating and tracking stolen portable computers for recovery via existing radio communication infrastructures or existing cellular network infrastructures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One typical example of computer tracking systems for locating stolen computers is the use of a software (location tracking program) installed to instruct the computer to call a third party monitoring service at regular intervals. When the computer calls the monitoring service, the computer establishes a data link and transmits data to the monitoring service that identifies the computer. When the monitoring service receives a call from the user&apos;s computer, the monitoring service is able to determine the location of the computer by utilizing Caller ID. The location of the computer may then be forwarded to a law enforcement agency so that the lost or stolen computer can be retrieved by the law enforcement agency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the location tracking program may also be installed to identify if an e-mail is being sent from the lost or stolen computer and compare a sender address to a predetermined owner address. If the sender address matches the owner address, the e-mail is sent unimpeded. However, if the sender address does not match with the sender address, then the e-mail is redirected to a third party such as a law enforcement agency to notify that the computer may have been stolen. However, such location tracking systems are typically complex, and are not optimal because a third party monitoring service is required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another example location tracking systems are known as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) systems which are available to uniquely identify and track devices equipped with RFID tags as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,232,870 for Applications For Radio Frequency Identification Systems issued to Garber et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,100,804 for Radio Frequency Identification System issued to Brady et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,963,134 for Inventory System Using Articles With RFID Tags issued to Bowers et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,838,253 for Radio Frequency Identification Label issued to Wurz et al. A typical RFID tag (also known as transponder) consists of a semiconductor chip having RF circuits, control logic, memory and an antenna (and a battery in the case of active tags) mounted to a substrate for providing remote identification. However, such RFID systems require dedicated wireless communications, and contain no general wireless data communications capabilities. Another drawback is that the user has purchase the RFID tags, the tag reader, and setup the environment specifically for the RFID service. RFID tags can also be cost prohibitive as each RFID tag can vary from 50 cents to $150 based on the desired capabilities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for a new type of asset security architecture and a radio-frequency (RF) location based theft recovery mechanism for an electronic device such as a mobile PC for providing security services of varying complexity, including enforcing security policies and obtaining location based information in order to report the location of a stolen device to a proper authority for tracking and recovering the stolen device. There is also a need for a pre-operating system (Pre-OS) solution or an operating system present (OS-Present) solution based on trigger security policies for communicating with a platform-based RF-based locator subsystem to obtain and transmit location based information to report the location of a stolen device.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The main memory <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may correspond to a dynamic random-access-memory (DRAM), but may be substituted for read-only-memory (ROM), video random-access-memory (VRAM) and the like. Such a memory <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may contain an operating system (OS) <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> such as Windows&trade; 95/98 and Windows&trade; 2000 for use by the processor subsystem <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and one or more OS-Present application programs <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. OS-Present application programs <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may be any application program that may execute while the operating system (OS) is present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The flash memory <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may contain Pre-OS application programs <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> such as, for example, a set of system basic input/output start-up instructions (system BIOS) as well as other applications that may execute during boot up (start-up) before the operating system (OS) <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is loaded, and other power saving instructions for full-on, standby and sleep states in accordance with the Advanced Power Management (APM) specification jointly developed by Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. in February 1996, and the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) specification, version 1.0B, jointly developed by Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Toshiba Corp. in February 1999. The Pre-OS application programs such as the system BIOS <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> may require user authentication such as a password before allowing the operating system (OS) to boot. Typically, a password or other authentication must be provided to allow for completion of booting of an operating system (OS), connecting to a network, accessing a database, or starting application programs such as, for example, an electronic mail program. Alternatively, the Pre-OS application programs <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> may also be stored in the main memory <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> along with the operating system (OS) <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and the OS-Present application programs <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The graphics/display subsystem <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may include, for example, a graphics controller, a local memory and a display monitor (e.g., cathode ray tube, liquid crystal display, flat panel display, etc.). </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The USB ports and IDE ports may be used to provide an interface to a hard disk drive (HDD), a compact disk read-only-memory (CD-ROM), a readable and writeable compact disk (CDRW), a digital audio tape (DAT) reader. I/O devices may include, for example, a keyboard controller for controlling operations of an alphanumeric keyboard, a cursor control device such as a mouse, track ball, touch pad, joystick, etc., a mass storage device such as magnetic tapes, hard disk drives (HDD), floppy disk drives (FDD), memory sticks and serial and parallel ports to printers, scanners, and display devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The host chipset <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may correspond to, for example, in Intel&reg; <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>, Intel&reg; <highlight><bold>870</bold></highlight> and 8XX series chipsets which include, for example, a memory controller hub (MCH) for controlling operations of the main storage <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and an IO controller hub (ICH) for controlling operations of the protected storage <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and a variety of I/O devices, via standard PCI, ISA or EISA bus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may contain an identification (ID) number unique to the mobile PC <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for identification purposes and can determine information relating to the location of the mobile PC <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> using, for example, Global Positioning Satellite (GPS), and RF-triangulation methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may be integrated into the host chipset <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> as system-on-chip designs that is compatible with ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) design flows. Alternatively, the RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may be a single &ldquo;plug-andplay&rdquo; module, including the ASIC and passive components for communications over longer distances. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> According to an embodiment of the present invention, a Pre-OS application program such as the system BIOS <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> may be configured in accordance with Intel&reg; Protected Access Architecture (IPAA) described in Application Interface Specification, Revision 1.0 available from Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif. (the &ldquo;IPAA Specification&rdquo;). More specifically, the Pre-OS application program (system BIOS) <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> may be configured with security code (IPAA control code) that can be activated to trigger and enforce security policies during the boot process from the time the power is turned on (or during certain resume sequences) until control is passed to the operating system (OS) <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Similarly, an OS-Present application program <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may be configured with security code that can be incorporated or integrated into the operating system (OS) <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and can be activated to load, monitor and enforce (trigger) security policies for user authentication, while the operating system (OS) is loaded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Security code (IPAA control code) of the OS-Present application program <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and/or the Pre-OS application program (system BIOS) <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> may routinely access the RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to determine the current location of the mobile PC <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> during boot-up and/or during normal operation. The security code (IPAA control code) may check whether any of the security policies has been violated to make a decision that is the mobile PC <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may have been stolen or used inappropriately. Based on this decision, the security code (IPAA control code) can report the current location of the stolen device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to a proper authority, via the Internet or the like, or via the RF-based wireless network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Security policies are simple rules, such as &ldquo;If&lt;condition(s)&gt;then&lt;a trigger event as occurred is reported&gt;&rdquo;. Sample security policies for Pre-OS applications <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and/or OS-Present applications <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> may include, for example: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Several failed log-on attempts by an unauthorized user; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Unauthorized changes attempted on selected platform policies; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Monitored services have been used by an unauthorized user&mdash;Services may be hardware and/or software oriented, such as disk drive access, applications, modem usage etc.); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Time Expires, including expiration of a renewable certificate, expiration of a designated time without communicating to a policy server or to a security token; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Regular Communication, including expiration of a designated time interval or an unauthorized connection to a communication medium; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Unauthorized Tampering of Protected Storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> These sample security policies are not limited thereto. There may be single factors or multiple factors for user authentication such as a single password, any unauthorized changes attempted on selected platform policies, any unauthorized use of monitored services by an unauthorized user (such as disk drive access, applications, modem usage etc.), a certain time expiration based on a renewable certificate, or lack of communication to a policy server or to a security token (such as a smart card and an USB key), or any unauthorized deletion of a protected storage. In other embodiments, there may be multiple factors of other user authentication techniques which may be included, such as, for example, a retinal scan, a fingerprint scan, a voice print identification, location of logon such as an Internet Protocol (I.P.) address, a smart card scan etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates an example protected storage <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for supporting Pre-OS applications <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and OS-Present applications <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the protected storage <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be the protected storage hardware or hardware layer of the Intel&reg; Protected Access Architecture (IPAA) described in Application Interface Specification, Revision 1.0 available from Intel Corporation of Santa Clara, Calif. (the &ldquo;IPAA Specification&rdquo;) to store configuration data, security policies, authentication data and other information between the Pre-OS application (system BIOS) <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and the OS-Present application <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Interface <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> may be the interface layer described in the IPAA Specification, Pre-OS driver <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and OS-Present driver <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> may be the support layer or service provider described in the IPAA Specification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Pre-OS driver <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> may provide the interface between the Pre-OS applications <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and the protected storage <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the OS-Present driver <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> may provide the interface between the OS-Present applications <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and the protected storage <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The drivers <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>175</bold></highlight> provide interfaces that enable applications to access the protected storage <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Protected storage <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be connected to the host chipset <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and may be any nonvolatile readable and writeable memory device, such as, for example, magnetic storage media including hard disks, optical storage media including CDRW, flash memory devices, stick memory devices, and the like. In one embodiment, the protected storage <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is permanent to the electronic device such as the mobile PC <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and may not be easily removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Protected storage <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be used to store information about both how the identity of a user was determined and how the user was authorized so that particular applications or the operating system (OS) may make a determination if one or more additional authentication measures are required or if access should be denied by way of the security policies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> For example, a Pre-OS application (system BIOS) <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> may require that the user type in a password as authentication information. The system BIOS <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> may then store this information in the protected storage <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> regardless whether the logon attempt is successful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> If the logon attempt is successful, a later executing Pre-OS application program may access this password information or a message from the system BIOS <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> that the user was authenticated by receipt of a password. Based on receipt of this authentication information, the later executing Pre-OS application program <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> may choose not to request a typed in password. The same may apply for OS-Present application programs <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. Another Pre-OS application or an OS-Present application may obtain further authentication information from a user and either store the authentication information in the protected storage <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> or store an information specifically directed to another OS-Present application. The information passed may be the specific authentication information or may be a notice stating whether the authentication was successful. In this way, later executing Pre-OS and OS-Present applications may use earlier obtained authentication information from the protected storage <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to either alleviate the need to further authenticate or reduce the extent of later authentication measures. For example after receiving a password, a later application may not seek a password from the user and may only request the sliding of a smart card or the presentation of a biometric means of authentication such as voice print, retinal scan, fingerprint scan and smart card scan etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> If the several logon attempts are unsuccessful, however, the security code (IPAA control code) of the Pre-OS application program (system BIOS) <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> makes a decision that the mobile PC <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may have been stolen or used inappropriately. The security code (IPAA control code) of the Pre-OS application (system BIOS) <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> may then access the RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to determine the current location of the mobile PC <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and report the current location of the stolen device <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to a proper authority, via the Internet or the like, or via the RF-based wireless network. </paragraph>

The system BIOS <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> then collects data from the specified trigger sub-systems, the location based information from the RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> at block <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Next, the system BIOS <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> determines if there is a trigger event, that is, if there is a violation of the security policies during user authentication at block <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Turning now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, various implementation examples of the RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> used to obtain the current location of the mobile PC <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and, in some instances, report the location based information, via an RF-based wireless network, to a proper authority such as the police are described hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an example RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may be a GPS receiver that is part of an accurate three-dimensional global positioning satellite (GPS) system to obtain radio positioning and navigation information, including location based information. The RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> (i.e., GPS receiver) may track pseudo-random noise from a plurality of GPS satellites, via the antenna complex <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight> and generate therefrom time-of-arrival values. Thereafter, the RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may sample the time-of-arrival values from the GPS constellation for each of the GPS satellites <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>N and multiply the sample data by the speed of light to produce a plurality of pseudo-range measurements. The RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> then adjusts these pseudo-range measurements to compensate for deterministic errors such as the difference between each satellite&apos;s clock and GPS system time, atmospheric distortion of GPS signals and other considerations such as relativity factors. The RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may include an instruction set which gathers the information necessary to compute adjustments to the pseudo-range measurements from a 50 Hz digital data stream which the GPS satellites broadcast along with their precision and coarse acquisition code. After the RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> makes all the necessary adjustments to the pseudo-range measurements, the position/time solution process may then be performed to determine the present GPS receiver antenna position. The RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may compute its X, Y, Z position fix in terms of the World Geodetic System adapted in 1984, which is the basis on which the GPS develops its worldwide common grid references. Generally, the X, Y, Z coordinates are converted to latitude, longitude and altitude map datum prior to output. The GPS position solution is intrinsically referenced to the electrical phase center of the antenna. Finally, the RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may compute clock bias results which are one of the parameters to be considered in addition to the X, Y, Z coordinates. The clock bias may be computed in terms of the time offset of the clock in the RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> versus GPS system time. Accordingly, the location based information is obtained to establish the current location of the mobile PC <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may be a RF transmitter that is part of a stolen device recovery system to provide location based information. The RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> (i.e., RF transmitter) may be activated upon an occurrence of a trigger event to broadcast a silent, coded radio signal to a police tracking system <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, via a police radio tower <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>.

As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the RF-based locator subsystem <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may be a Bluetooth&trade; transceiver that is part of a Bluetooth&trade; based security system including a central security server <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and a network of Bluetooth (voice/data) Access Points (BTAPs) <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>N installed in a designated area such as a company site, a school, a building or an industry complex to provide security services for the mobile PC <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, including asset control, remote monitoring and tracking of the mobile PC <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, through the Internet or other networks whenever possible. Such a Bluetooth&trade; transceiver can determine information relating to the current location of the mobile PC <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> relative to the BTAPs <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>N by communicating with several BTAPs <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>N.

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> As described in this invention, the radio location based theft recovery mechanism can provide access control, tracking and security services of varying complexity. Pre-OS applications and OS-Present applications may be deployed to mobile PCs manually or via networks. Such software programs may be a software module provided on a tangible medium, such as a floppy disk or compact disk (CD) ROM, or via Internet downloads, which may be available for an IT administrator to conveniently plug-in or download into the host operating system (OS). Such software modules may also be available as a firmware module or a comprehensive hardware/software module which may be built-in the host. In addition, method steps of FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may be performed by a computer processor executing instructions organized into a program module or a custom designed state machine. Storage devices suitable for tangibly embodying computer program instructions include all forms of non-volatile memory including, but not limited to: semiconductor memory devices such as EPROM, EEPROM, and flash devices; magnetic disks (fixed, floppy, and removable); other magnetic media such as tape; and optical media such as CD-ROM disks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> While there have been illustrated and described what are considered to be exemplary embodiments of the present invention, it will be understood by those skilled in the art and as technology develops that various changes and modifications may be made, and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the true scope of the present invention. For example, IEEE 802.11b standards systems may be utilized as a wireless local area network (LAN) in lieu of the Bluetooth based system in order to specify an &ldquo;over the air&rdquo; interface between a wireless client and a base station or access point (AP), as well as among wireless clients. Transceivers may use the IEEE 802.11b standard to communicate with transmitters using the IEEE 802.11b standard and with each other to determine position relative to the transmitters.
