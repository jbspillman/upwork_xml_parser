<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to protective covers for guns and the like. More particularly, the present invention relates to a bag which is configured to cover and enclose both an object disposed upon a rack, and a portion of the rack. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are many carrying devices which attach to cars, trucks, ATV&apos;s, or other structures, for holding elongate objects. These range from simple gun racks, to more elaborate holding systems. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,607,772 and 5,078,279 disclose utility carrying devices for carrying guns, fishing poles, and the like, which are mountable to the handlebars, cargo rack, frame, or other parts of a car, truck, motorcycle, or ATV, or to a wall, window, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When a gun or other object is placed in such holders, especially when the holder is mounted on an ATV or other vehicle, it is often desirable to protect the elongate object with a cover or case of some kind. While cases and covers for protecting guns, fishing poles, and other objects are well known, merely placing the object in the holder while in its cover or case presents certain problems. When a user stores a gun, for example, in a conventional gun bag or case on an ATV gun rack, and access to the gun is desired, the user must typically remove both the gun and gun bag from the rack, set the bag upon the ground or some other surface, open the bag, and remove the gun. Removing the gun bag from the rack in order to gain access to the gun is very inconvenient, and promotes wear and dirtying of the bag. Additionally, the gripping portion of the rack will tend to rub against and wear the outer surface of the bag, thus shortening its life. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It has been recognized that it would be advantageous to develop a bag which encloses an object on a holder or rack, and which may be opened without removing the object or the bag from the holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It has also been recognized that it would be desirable to develop a bag which is attached to a holder, and which, when opened, may be folded into a compact shape and disposed out of the way, without being removed from the holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention advantageously provides a bag that is mounted to a rack or holder for holding an object. The bag includes a flexible case configured to enclose both the object and a portion of the holder upon which the object is disposed. Advantageously, the bag is configured to be opened to allow access to the object while the case remains attached to the holder. The bag includes an object opening sized to receive the object therethrough, and at least one holder opening sized to receive a portion of the holder therethrough. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a more detailed aspect of the present invention, a transport system is provided, including a holder configured to be mounted on a vehicle, and a bag attached to the holder. The bag is configured to enclose both a portion of the holder, and an object disposed thereon. The bag includes two flexible sides hingedly joined along a lower edge, and releasably joined along the remaining edges. The bag is moveable between a closed configuration wherein the object and a portion of the holder are enclosed, and an open configuration wherein a user may have access to the object while the case remains attached to the holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another more detailed aspect of the present invention, when in the open position, the ends of the bag may be folded inwardly beneath a lower edge of the open bag, such that the ends of the bag are enclosed and held between the attached sides between the upright posts of the holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Additional features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the detailed description which follows, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which together illustrate, by way of example, features of the invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated in the drawings, and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. Any alterations and further modifications of the inventive features illustrated herein, and any additional applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated herein, which would occur to one skilled in the relevant art and having possession of this disclosure, are to be considered within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, the invention generally comprises a bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is configured to cover and contain both (1) an associated object, such as a gun <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and (2) a portion of the holder/rack/supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> upon which the object is stored. It is especially adapted for use with ATV-mounted carrier racks, and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is shown mounted upon the handlebars <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of an ATV or similar vehicle. Alternatively, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the rack <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (and thus the bag) may be mounted upon an elongate rail <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> or other comparable structure, such as a treestand handrail, a portion of a cargo rack, etc. The invention thus provides a bag/cover/case which encloses both the object and a portion of the object rack/support/holder. Such racks allow the holding of objects which may not easily fit onto or be securable upon a cargo rack or the like. Advantageously, the bag can be opened to provide access to the object, while staying in place upon the holder, without having to be removed to be opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It will be apparent that the size, shape, and configuration of the bag may be selected to correspond to a variety of objects, as desired. As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the bag may be configured to cover and protect a rifle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> disposed on the rack <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> differently shaped bag <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be configured for enclosing a bow <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. It will be apparent that the bag may be configured to accommodate other elongate objects also, such as a fishing pole (not shown), a shovel (not shown), etc. It will be apparent that such elongate objects may require more than one upright support <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> differently shaped bag <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be configured for enclosing a small object, such as binoculars <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, which requires only one upright support or holder <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Other embodiments may be devised for use with other objects of varying sizes and shapes, such as a handgun (not shown), a tackle box (not shown), coats (not shown), a small cooler (not shown), odd-shaped tools such as a chainsaw (not shown), a leaf blower (not shown), etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Returning to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the holder mounted bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> generally comprises a flexible bag or case having a first side <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a second side <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which are hingedly or flexibly connected along a lower edge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The bag may be a relatively flexible durable fabric (e.g. canvas, nylon, etc), and is preferably waterproof. The first and second sides each have an interior face <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and an exterior face <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The interior faces may include a soft interior material, such as felt or other soft fabric, for protecting the object from damage. The bags <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> are configured similarly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The flexible bag <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also has a closure device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, such as a zipper, snaps, hook and loop fasteners (i.e. velcro), or other similarly useful mechanism, disposed at least along a portion of an upper edge <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the bag, and possibly also along two side edges <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The closure device allows the first and second sides <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the bag to be releasably joined, in order to form an object opening <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In the case of a gun <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, for example, the object opening <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may extend along the entirety of the upper edge <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, along the side edges <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and perhaps also a portion of the lower edge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, allowing the entire case to be laid open. The same may be true for other embodiments, such as the bag <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. However, in other embodiments, such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the bag <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may include an object opening which extends along just the top edge <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, or, alternatively, along the top edge and some or all of the side edges <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Returning to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the lower edge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes one or more holder openings <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for allowing the rack supports <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to extend into the interior of the bag when it is closed. These holder openings <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be large in size to accommodate a wide variety of sizes and types of racks which may extend therethrough, and may be provided with a zipper, snaps, buttons, velcro, or other attachment device <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which allows the holder openings <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to be partially closed over the rack supports <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> when in place, to minimize the size of the opening(s) and to more securely attach the bag to the holder. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> This invention provides several desirable features and advantages. To gain access to the object, a user simply opens the object opening <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> by disconnecting the closure device <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to separate the upper edge <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (and possibly also the side edges <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) of the bag, and removes the object from the rack <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. If the side edges <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are also opened, the sides <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the bag will drop or rotate down and away from the object <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, exposing the interior faces <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In the open position, the object is conveniently accessible upon the rack <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Advantageously, the object is directly held by the object holder, as designed. However, because the sides of the bag are flexibly connected by the lower edge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, they remain attached to the rack, and in position to again be folded up to encase the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When the sides of the bag are again folded up around the object, the bag may be closed along the upper edge <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and side edges <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In this position the object is protected from rain and damage from surroundings, and the bag or case is not exposed to excessive wear, dirt, or other unnecessarily damaging conditions. Additionally, because the bag encloses the object and is attached to the holder or rack, it provides additional security by helping to hold the object on the rack. For example, if the object were to be jarred loose in the holder, such as when attached to a moving ATV, the bag itself would provide an additional measure of safety to prevent the object from entirely coming off of the holder and the vehicle. Likewise, the bag can help to secure an object which may not fit securely in the rack alone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Disposed on the outer sides of the bag, near the upper edge <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, are fasteners <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, such as velcro, snaps, buttons, a zipper, etc., which are provided to allow the outer faces <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the sides <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the bag to be attached to each other when the bag is opened and downwardly folded together. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, when the bag is open and the sides have dropped downward to expose the object or other elongate item, the ends of the bag <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (those portions extending from each support <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to the nearest respective side edge <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>) may be folded inwardly beneath the lower edge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and substantially between the supports <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, in the case of a bag in which the object opening extends only along the upper edge <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the bag may be folded downward and inverted, placing the outer faces <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the sides <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the bag adjacent to each other. The fasteners <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are then connected to each other below the lower edge, such that the ends <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the bag are enclosed and held between the attached sides below the holder. This folding feature advantageously allows the open bag to be folded into a compact shape which is out of the way, and thereby helps prevent the open bag from interfering with operation of the ATV, and also helps protect the bag from damage when opened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that the above-described arrangements are only illustrative of the application of the principles of the present invention. Numerous modifications and alternative arrangements may be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention and the appended claims are intended to cover such modifications and arrangements. Thus, while the present invention has been shown in the drawings and fully described above with particularity and detail in connection with what is presently deemed to be the most practical and preferred embodiment(s) of the invention, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications, including, but not limited to, variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use may be made, without departing from the principles and concepts of the invention as set forth in the claims. </paragraph>
