<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to wireless telecommunication systems and particularly to such systems that provide a variety of different services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Third generation wireless systems are packet based multi-service networks supporting a range of communication requirements for different applications. To support the multi-service features, third generation networks may guarantee a certain quality of service to each session established by a mobile subscriber. A mobile subscriber may establish up to sixteen sessions through a given packet data protocol address. A packet data protocol is any protocol that transmits data as discrete units known as packets. A packet is an information unit identified by a label. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Advice of Charge is a supplementary service that provides third generation mobile subscribers with information to produce an estimate of the cost of service used. See &ldquo;Advice of Charge Supplementary Service Stage One,&rdquo; 3G TS 22.086 v3.1.0 (1999-10) available from the Third Generation Partnership Project, 650 Route des Lucioles-Sophia Antipolis, Valbonne-France; Description of Charge Advice Information 3G TS 22.024 v3.00.1 (1999-10) available from the Third Generation Partnership Project. Charges are indicated for a call in progress when mobile originated or for the roaming leg only when mobile terminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Packet based services provided by third generation networks may include streaming audio, streaming video, multimedia and data. For these kinds of services, there may be more downlink traffic than uplink traffic. The current specification for the Advice of Charge supplementary service does not provide complete charge information for the mobile terminated calls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The service specified in the Advice of Charge supplementary service specification is service provider based. Therefore, if the service provider chooses not to support the service, a particular mobile subscriber will not be provided with the information. In addition, the Advice of Charge supplementary service does not take into account the possibility that a particular packet data protocol address may have a plurality of sessions associated with that address. Each of those sessions may be receiving a different type of data having a different quality of service specification. Thus, the estimate received through the Advice of Charge supplementary service may be inaccurate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need for a system that better advises mobile subscribers of the charges they are incurring. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> mobile unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be a cellular telephone. In one embodiment, the unit <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a subscriber unit in a third generation or higher mobile phone communication system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The mobile subscriber has a packet data protocol address <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This is the address through which the mobile subscriber is identified in the cellular network. However, in some embodiments, each mobile subscriber may have a plurality of sessions or contexts ongoing at any time. For example, sixteen sessions may be ongoing at any given time. Each of these sessions may use a different type of packet-based service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Thus, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the packet data protocol context <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a voice session, the context <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is a data session, and the context <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is a streaming session. Any of a variety of packet-based services may be established in a given session at a given packet data protocol address <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thus, a plurality of data sessions may be ongoing at any given time or a mixture of streaming audio, streaming video, multimedia and data services may be ongoing at any given time at a given address <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Each of the sessions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may have a specified set of quality of service parameters called a traffic flow template <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. See &ldquo;General Packet Radio Service (GPRS); Service Description; Stage 2&rdquo; 3G TS 22.060 v.3.2.1 (2000-01) available from The Third Generation Partnership Project. Each traffic flow template <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provides certain quality of service parameters that may be specified for a given session. One session may have unspecified parameters and, in such case, a default may be automatically utilized in some embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Each of the sessions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may communicate with an account manager <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The account manager <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, may be a software module that is responsible for receiving information from the sessions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and determining the real time charges that have been incurred. To assist in this function, the account manager <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may receive information from the mobility management state of the mobile unit as indicated at <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and charge advice information pursuant to various specifications including the Advice of Charge supplementary service, as indicated at block <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Of course, in some cases, the charge advice information <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be available and in other cases, a network or service provider may opt not to provide that information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Software <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, may estimate the charge for each of the sessions <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. This estimate may be based on a wide variety of measures including the number of packet data units that are being transmitted across the network. In one embodiment, the packet data units may correspond to home units that are the basic telecommunication unit as published by the mobile subscriber&apos;s home public land mobile network (home PLMN) and may be in the currency of the mobile subscriber&apos;s home country. Additional information that may be utilized to assess the charges may include the number of packet data units that are received by the mobile subscriber. Also relevant may be the quality of service parameter information for each session based on the traffic flow template <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for that session. The charge advice information message received from the network at the beginning of the call may also be useful. This message may be pursuant to the Third Generation Partnership Project technical specification 3G TS 22.024 in one embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The mobility management state information for charge estimation for all call legs including roaming and non-roaming calls may be used. Mobility management is a relation between the mobile station and the Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network that is used to set up, maintain and release the various physical channels. See &ldquo;General Packet Radio Service (GPRS); Service Description; Stage 2&rdquo; 3G TS 22.060 v.3.2.1 (2000-01) available from the Third Generation Partnership Project. Thus routing area (RA) updates may be acquired upon call origination and termination. The identified routing area may be used to determine charges including roaming charges, for example using a look up table. These charges may be determined for both mobile originated and mobile terminated calls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network identifies that part of a network that consists of radio network controllers and node b&apos;s. A node b is a logical node responsible for radio transmission or reception in one or more cells to or from user equipment. A radio network controller is equipment in charge of controlling the use and integrity of radio resources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Thus a report may be developed of charges based on protocol data unit transmissions, providing the packet-based mobile subscriber with the capability to manage his or her account and keep track of charges incurred. In some embodiments, the charges may be specified in terms of home units and in other embodiments, the charges may be specified in the currency of the home user&apos;s country, as two examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Initially, the software <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> determines whether a new packet data protocol context or session has been activated as determined at diamond <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. If so, the quality of service (QoS) parameters for that session are sent to the account manager <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as indicated in block <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> If a new context or session is not activated, a check at diamond <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> determines whether a context or session has been modified. If so, the updated quality of service parameters are provided to the account manager <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as indicated in block <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A check at diamond <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> indicates whether any new packet data units have been received or delivered. If so, the cost is updated to the account manager <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> as indicated at block <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The account manager <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may also receive charge advice information messages from the network as indicated at <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in some situations. In addition, the account manager may receive the mobility management state of the mobile subscriber as indicated at <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The flow then recycles back to diamond <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> mobile unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may include a network interface <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> coupled to a processor <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> may have an associated storage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The storage <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may store the charge per session software <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in one embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention may provide charge information to mobile terminals irrespective of the applicable air interface. Moreover, in some embodiments, a real time estimate of the charges per session may be provided, irrespective of whether or not the applicable service provider supports Advice of Charge supplementary services. In addition, in some embodiments, the account manager <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> provides a real time estimate of cost per session for all legs, roaming and non-roaming. Moreover, in some embodiments, the quality of service parameters may be utilized to supplement the estimate of costs of service per session. Thus, each of a variety of sessions may have a different service, which may incur costs at a different rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Finally, in some embodiments, the account manager <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may utilize mobility management state information to estimate the real time charges per session incurred during roaming and non-roaming scenarios. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art will appreciate numerous modifications and variations therefrom. It is intended that the appended claims cover all such modifications and variations as fall within the true spirit and scope of this present invention.</paragraph>
