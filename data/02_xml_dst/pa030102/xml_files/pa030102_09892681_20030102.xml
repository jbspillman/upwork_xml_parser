<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to reducing undesirable audio signals, and, more particularly, to reducing undesirable audio signals using portable devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Portable electronic devices of various types have become prevalent for everyday use. For example, it is not uncommon to find consumers today using cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), pagers, portable music players such as MP3 (Moving Pictures Expert Group, Layer 3) players, and other types of music players. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Portable devices of the current generation are generally more flexible, robust, and even smaller in size than their predecessors. The relative small size of today&apos;s portable devices makes it convenient for users to carry them to practically any desired destination. Users on the move, however, are sometimes compelled to use the portable devices in an unfriendly environment where undesirable audio signals may be prevalent. For example, while riding in an automobile, a user of a wireless phone may be subjected to a constant, unappealing or disturbing sound of the automobile engine. As another example, a user attempting to listen to music at home on a portable device may be disturbed by the undesirable sound of a vacuum cleaner. The users of such portable devices may similarly be disturbed by a variety of other undesirable audio signals in other environments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for an improved way of reducing undesirable audio signals. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> block diagram of a portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. The portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, may be a computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), video camera, pager, portable music player, and the like. The portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, may be a communications device, such as a wireless phone, a pager, or any other device capable of transmitting and receiving information to and from another device. In one embodiment, the portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be a readily transportable device, such as a hand-held device. The portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, may be a battery-powered device where the battery serves as the main power supply for the portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for the duration during which no electrical power is supplied from an external, fixed power source, such as an electrical outlet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As described in more detail below, the portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, includes an audio reduction signal (ARS) control unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> that generates an audio reduction signal (ARS) that, when provided through an output interface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, may be able to reduce undesirable audio signals that are sensed by a sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or are otherwise audible to the user of the portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The term &ldquo;undesirable audio signals,&rdquo; as utilized herein, may generally refer to one of many undesirable sounds that may be audible to a user of the portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, sounds such as those from engines of operating vehicles, machinery, heavy winds, vacuum cleaners and the like. In one embodiment, the &ldquo;undesirable audio signals&rdquo; may include low frequency, high frequency or constant frequency sounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the ARS control unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> receives a sensed signal from the sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Although not so limited, in one embodiment, the sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be a microphone that is able to sense audio signals while the portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in use. The ARS control unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, generates an audio reduction signal that is provided to a signal adder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The signal adder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, receives an audio input signal from source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and combines the audio reduction signal from the ARS control unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with the audio input signal. The output of the signal adder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may be provided to the output interface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be one of a variety of sources of audio signals, depending on the particular implementation. For example, if the portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a music player, then the source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may represent a storage unit (e.g., diskette, hard drive, compact disc) on which music may be stored. As an additional example, the source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be a coder and decoder (codec) of a wireless phone. In other embodiments, the source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the input signal may vary depending on the implementation. Although the source <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment provides an audio signal, in an alternative embodiment, the source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may provide a video signal instead. Thus, in one embodiment, the signal adder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> may combine the audio reduction signal generated by the control unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and the video signal from the source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The output interface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, may serve as an interface to one or more speakers of the portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In an alternative embodiment, the output interface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> may be an interface to a headphone set <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the headphone set <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may include one or more sensors <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for sensing undesirable audio signals that may then be provided to the control unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. In some instances it may be desirable to remove or at least reduce undesirable or unpleasant sounds that a user hears, and, as such, it may be advantageous to sense these sounds closer to the user&apos;s ears. For this reason, in an alternative embodiment, the sensors <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> on the headphone set <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be employed instead of the sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, both the sensor <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be utilized to sense undesirable audio signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> flow diagram of a method that may be employed by the portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is illustrated, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The control unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, receives (at <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>) an undesirable audio signal from the sensor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the one or more sensors <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may sense the undesirable audio signal that is provided to the control unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment. The control unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> generates (at <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>) an audio reduction signal that, in one embodiment, is out of phase with the received (at <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>) signal. In one embodiment, the generated audio signal is substantially 180 degrees out of phase with the received (at <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>) signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives (at <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>) an input audio signal from the audio input signal source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As mentioned, the input audio signal may vary depending on the implementation. The signal adder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, combines (at <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>) the generated (at <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>) signal with the received (at <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>) input audio signal. The signal adder <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> provides (at <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>), in one embodiment, the combined signal to the output interface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, such as a speaker. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The combined (at <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>) signal may be played through a speaker, in one embodiment. The generated (at <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>) signal, when played through the speaker, may reduce the undesirable audio signal that may have otherwise been audible to the user of the portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the undesirable audio signal may be reduced to a level that is no longer audible to the user. It may be possible to reduce, or even cancel, the undesirable audio signal because the generated (at <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>) signal, when delivered through the speaker, offsets at least a portion of the out of phase undesirable audio signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> block diagram of the portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is illustrated in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention. In particular, in the illustrated embodiment the portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, includes a control unit <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> that is communicatively coupled to a storage unit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The storage unit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, may have stored therein an operating system, protocol stack, and/or application. In one embodiment, the storage unit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may include one or music files that may be played by the wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. That is, in one embodiment, the wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may also serve as a music player that is capable of playing music files having one of several formats, such as the MP3 format. In one embodiment, the wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may include a media interface <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> for reading and/or writing information (such as music files) on removable media, such as diskettes, compact discs, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, includes a transceiver <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> that is communicatively coupled to an antenna <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> through which information may be transmitted or received over a wireless medium. For example, the transceiver <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> may transmit and/or receive voice signals over a wireless medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, may include an active noise cancellation block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, which, as described in more detail below, is capable of generating a signal that reduces or cancels unwanted background noise. The active noise cancellation block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, generates its signal based on an input signal received from a microphone <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. The active noise cancellation block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may be implemented in software, hardware, or a combination of both. For example, in one embodiment, if the active noise cancellation block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> is implemented in software, it may be stored in the storage unit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. The active noise cancellation block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may be one embodiment of the audio signal reduction control unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, includes a signal adder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> that receives the output signal from the active noise cancellation block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and a CODEC <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> and provides an output signal to a speaker <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>. The CODEC <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, decodes voice signals received by the transceiver <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, such as when the wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is utilized to play music files, the CODEC <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> may be bypassed, if desired. In one embodiment, the CODEC <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> converts digital signals to analog signals, which may then be provided to the signal adder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The operation of the wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, may include the microphone <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> detecting an undesirable audio signal, which may then be provided to the active noise cancellation block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The active noise cancellation block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, based on the signal received from the microphone <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>, generates an audio reduction signal. The audio reduction signal, for example, may be a signal that is out of phase with the signal received from the microphone <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the audio reduction signal may be substantially 180 degrees out of phase with the received signal. The audio reduction signal may then be provided to the signal adder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, which, in one embodiment, adds the audio reduction signal with other audio signals (e.g., voice, music) and provides its output signal to the speaker <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>. When the output from the signal adder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is played through the speaker <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>, the out-of-phase audio reduction signal (generated by the active noise cancellation block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>) may reduce the undesirable audio signal that is otherwise audible to the user of the wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Since, in one embodiment, the output signal of the signal adder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> may also include other audio signals, such as the voice of the remote party, the user of the wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be able to engage in conversation with the other party, with reduced undesirable audio signals in the background. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, includes an input keypad <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and a display unit <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>. The input keypad <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, allows a user to enter numeric or alphanumeric data. The keypad <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> may include control keys, such as arrows keys, that enable a user to maneuver through a graphical user interface displayed on the display unit <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment. The input keypad <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, may include a power &ldquo;on/off&rdquo; key (or other activatable element) to activate or deactivate the wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the functionality of the display unit <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> and input keypad <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> may be integrated into a single device, such as a touch-sensitive display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, if desired, the active noise cancellation block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and/or the signal adder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> may be able to process digital signals. As such, the signal received from the microphone <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> may be converted to a digital signal, in one embodiment, before it is provided to the active noise cancellation block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, in one embodiment, the active noise cancellation block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may itself perform the digital conversion. Additionally, the output of the signal adder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, may be converted from a digital-to-analog form, where the signal adder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> itself or a separate digital-to-analog converter may be utilized for analog conversion. If the signal adder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is adapted to receive digital signals, then, in one embodiment, the CODEC <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> may not need to perform digital-to-analog conversion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the active noise cancellation block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may generate the audio reduction signal based on one or more selected characteristics of the signal received from the microphone <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. For example, in one embodiment, the active noise cancellation block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may filter selected frequencies (e.g., frequencies in the voice band range) of the received signal before generating the audio reduction signal. Filtering selected frequencies may be desirable, for instance, to prevent the audio reduction signal, when played through the speaker <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>, from reducing certain audible signals, such as voices. Thus, in one embodiment, the active noise cancellation block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may generate the audio reduction signal based on only selected frequencies (or range of frequencies) of the undesirable audio signal that are desired to be reduced or otherwise cancelled. In another embodiment, the active noise cancellation block <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may generate the audio reduction signal based on the amplitude of the signal received from the microphone <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. That is, in one embodiment, the audio reduction signal may be generated based on only signals from the microphone <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> that are either above or below a threshold value. Generating the audio reduction signal based on the amplitude threshold may allow the wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to reduce or otherwise remove undesirable audio signals that are above a selected threshold level, for example. In one embodiment, the audio reduction signal is based on both selected frequencies and amplitude levels of the signal received from the microphone <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a user may be able to use the wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to simply reduce undesirable audio signals. That is, using the input keypad <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, in one embodiment, the user may be able to activate the active noise cancellation feature of the wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> without being on the phone itself. Thus, for example, a user in the process of driving in an automobile may activate the active noise cancellation feature to reduce background sound, such as the noise of the engine. At an airport, the user may be able to reduce airplane noise in the background, for example. Similarly, the wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be utilized, in one embodiment, to reduce undesirable audio signals in other settings or environments as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> One or more embodiments of the present invention may provide selected advantages to the user of the portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, with the advent of one or more embodiments of the portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it may be possible to reduce, or even remove, undesirable audio signals. In another embodiment, the undesirable audio signals may be reduced using a control unit <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> for processing audio signals (e.g., voice, music) and for generating an (undesirable) audio reduction signal. As such, in some instances, the need for multiple or separate processors (e.g., one for processing audio signals and another for reducing undesirable audio signals) may be avoided. In some cases, with the advent of one or more embodiments, a user may readily carry the portable device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a noisy location to reduce undesirable sounds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that configuration of the wireless phone <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is illustrative only, and that in alternative embodiments, other configurations with more or fewer elements may be employed. For example, in an alternate embodiment, additional components (such as bridges or other integrated circuits) may be present between the control unit <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and one or more of the components (e.g., CODEC <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>, media interface <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, display unit <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>). Similarly, other components (such as buffers, caches or other circuitry) may be employed between the control unit <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> and the storage unit <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, one or more amplifiers may be utilized to amplify signals, such as the output signal of the signal adder <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> before it is provided to the speaker. Similarly, other configurations of the portable device <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be employed without deviating from the spirit and/or scope of one or more embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The various system layers, routines, or modules may be executable control units (such as control unit <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>)). Each control unit may include a microprocessor, a digital signal processor, a microcontroller, a processor card (including one or more microprocessors or controllers), or other control or computing devices. The storage devices referred to in this discussion may include one or more machine-readable storage media for storing data and instructions. The storage media may include different forms of memory including semiconductor memory devices such as dynamic or static random access memories (DRAMs or SRAMs), erasable and programmable read-only memories (EPROMs), electrically erasable and programmable read-only memories (EEPROMs) and flash memories; magnetic disks such as fixed, floppy, removable disks; other magnetic media including tape; and optical media such as compact disks (CDs) or digital video disks (DVDs).
