<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed toward exercise equipment and more particularly toward the type of exercise equipment which includes multi-stations or positions allowing the user to perform various types of exercises. The invention is specifically designed to allow a user to perform various pulling exercises such as lat pulldowns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Typically, exercise apparatus useful with the present invention is of a type known as weight machines which include a support frame on which a weight stack is mounted for vertical movement and which is linked to various exercise stations by way of a linkage system such as cables and pulley mechanisms. This allows the user to lift the weights using different muscle groups depending on the exercise station used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One exercise that is desired and frequently incorporated into weight machines is designed to exercise the latissimus dorsi muscle group and is commonly referred to as a lat pulldown or exercise lat pulls. This is normally performed while the user is in a sitting position. He or she reaches a bar that is suspended overhead and pulls the same straight down in a vertical plane. The bar can be pulled down either in front of the user or behind the head of the user. In either case, movement of the bar downwardly is resisted by the weights in the weight stack in the manner which is well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Weight machines that allow for lat pulldowns must, therefore, be of a relatively large size since they must include a frame for supporting the lat pulldown bar mounted overhead. Such machines, therefore, cannot normally be made as compact as may be desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In an attempt to simplify weight machines capable of doing lat pulldowns and making them more compact, it has been suggested to perform lat pulldown exercises while the user is in a horizontal prone position lying either on his or her back or front. While there may be some merit to this approach, it requires that the weight machine be somewhat longer to accommodate the length of the person lying down and also requires some type of locking or holding mechanism for the user&apos;s feet to prevent the user&apos;s body from being drawn toward the bar or weights being pulled. This solution, therefore, may create more problems than it solves. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention is designed to overcome the deficiencies of the prior art described above. The exercising machine according to the invention includes a seat having a seat back that is normally oriented in a substantially vertical orientation and a seat bottom on which the user of the machine can sit while performing a variety of different exercises. The seat and the exercising machine are designed so that the said user can sit on the seat bottom in a position facing forwardly away from the seat back or facing rearwardly toward the seat back. The seat back is movable between its substantially vertical orientation and a substantially horizontal orientation by pivoting either the top or the lower end thereof forwardly and a locking mechanism is provided for maintaining the seat back in its selected position. When the seat back is in the horizontal position, the user can sit on the seat bottom facing rearwardly and perform various exercises such as pulling exercises using the top edge or the lower end of the seat back as a horizontal restraint. The top edge and/or the lower end of the seat back is padded for the comfort of the user. The seat bottom may also be movable to accommodate the user.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings in detail wherein like numerals have been used throughout the various figures to designate like elements, there is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1 a</cross-reference> pivoting backrest constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention and designated generally as <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The backrest <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in combination with a weight machine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This is, however, by way of example only as various other types of weight machines could also be employed with the present invention. Furthermore, the pivoting seat back of the present invention could be used with a much simpler exercising apparatus as will be explained more fully hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In any event, the exercising machine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a seat including a seat bottom <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> mounted on a frame <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The seat bottom <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably mounted so as to be slidably moveable forwardly i.e. to the right as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> or rearwardly i.e. to the left as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in order to accommodate the user of the apparatus in performing various different exercises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The exercise machine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> also includes a weight stack <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which is linked to various parts of the equipment through a plurality of cables and pulley mechanisms such as shown at <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to enable the user to exercise various different muscle groups. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> At the very least, the apparatus useful with the present invention must include resistive means that can be gripped by a person&apos;s hands and which are moveable in a substantially horizontal direction. In the exercise equipment <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> illustrated in the figures, this includes a lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> having its lower end pivoted to a base member and including a pair of arms <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that extend forwardly at either side of the apparatus and terminate in hand grips <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The foregoing apparatus thus described is, per se, well known in the art. Similar machines have been known for some time and are shown and described, for example, in prior U.S. Pat. Nos. Des. 359,326 and 6,030,322. Since the apparatus is, per se, well known, it is not believed that a detailed description of the operation of the component parts thereof is necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The present invention is primarily concerned with the backrest or seat back <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and more particularly with its ability to be moved between its substantially vertical orientation as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> and a substantially horizontal orientation as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. It must be understood, however, that when utilizing the term substantially vertical orientation with reference to the seat back <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, Applicant does not intend the same to require that the seat back be perfectly vertical or 90&deg; to the horizontal. Rather, this term is intended to refer to the orientation of the seat back wherein a person sitting on the seat bottom <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and resting against the forward facing surface <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the seat back <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> will be sitting essentially upright or leaning back slightly. Similarly, the term substantially horizontal orientation is not intended to refer to an orientation wherein the seat back <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is parallel to the floor. Rather, this term is intended to refer to any position such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> wherein the padded top <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the seat back (or the padded bottom in the second embodiment to be described hereinbelow) has been moved into a substantially horizontal enough position to engage the user&apos;s stomach as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> to provide horizontal restraint for the user&apos;s body while performing various pulling exercises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In order to achieve the advantages of the present invention, the backrest or seat back <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is secured to a substantially triangularly shaped bracket <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which has its lower forward end pivoted at pivot point <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to the upper end of a substantially vertically extending frame member <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> which forms part of the exercise machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The upper end of the frame member <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> also includes an opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> spaced at a slight distance from the pivot point <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The bracket <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> supporting the seat back <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of apertures such as shown at <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in an arcuate arrangement whereby any one of the apertures <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be placed into alignment with the opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> when the seat <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is pivoted clockwise as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> or <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. When the seat back <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is in its desired position such as the substantially horizontal position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> pin can be inserted through the selected aperture <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which passes into the opening <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to maintain the seat back in its pivoted position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the seat back <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> having been pivoted into its substantially horizontal orientation. This was done, as pointed out above, by moving the top <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the seat back forwardly thereby rotating the seat back <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> about the pivot point <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. By sitting on the exercise machine and facing rearwardly, the user can then perform lat pulldown exercises by grasping the lever <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and pulling forwardly. The top <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the seat back <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> provides horizontal restraint for the user&apos;s body and, as pointed out above, is padded to provide comfort to the user. Other exercises that can be performed with the seat back <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> in a pivoted position are illustrated diagramatically in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 5</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> illustrate a second embodiment of the improved pivotal seat back of the present invention. This embodiment is similar to the embodiment described above but, instead of the seat back <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> pivoting in a clockwise direction whereby the top <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> pivots forwardly, in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, the seat back <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> pivots in a counterclockwise position wherein the bottom or lower end <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the seat back <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> moves forwardly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In order to accomplish the foregoing, a substantially triangularly shaped bracket <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is secured to the back of the seat back <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The triangularly shaped bracket <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, however, is designed so to have its triangular peak adjacent the center portion (from top to bottom as viewed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) of the seat back <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The bracket <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is pivoted to the top of the vertically extending frame <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> through the use of a pivot member <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. In this way, the seat back <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> can be pivoted between its substantially vertical orientation as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and by moving the lower end <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> forwardly, into its substantially horizontal orientation as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The seat back can be locked in position using any means known in the art such as a locking handle threaded to the pivot joint. Since the lower end <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> of the seat back <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> will now engage the user&apos;s body, the lower end <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is preferably padded for the comfort of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In both of the embodiments of the invention described above, the seat back <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is mounted for pivotal movement with respect to the frame of the apparatus. This is, by way of example only. It is not beyond the scope of the present invention to provide means other than pivoting for orienting the seat back. It is possible, for example, to provide the seat back and frame member with a plurality of pins and slots or the like wherein the seat back is totally removed, reoriented and reapplied to the frame member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> While the improved seat <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of the present invention has been shown in combination with a relatively complex exercise machine, much simpler machines could be used. For example, the moveable seat back of the present invention could be combined with a relatively simply chair which is placed next to a wall where elastic cords with handles are secured. The user would then sit on the seat bottom <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> facing the wall with the seat back in its substantially horizontal orientation and would pull on the cords in order to perform lat pulldowns. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof and accordingly, reference should be made to the appended claims rather than to the foregoing specification as indicating the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
