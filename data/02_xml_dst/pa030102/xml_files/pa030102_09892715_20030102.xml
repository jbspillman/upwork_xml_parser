<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to decorative tubiform wired ribbon and to a method and apparatus for making the same. More specifically, the invention relates to tubiform fabric or plastic ribbons that are formed of two-ply fabric that is edged with wire and trimmed with an overlay of decorative thread and which can include a decorative insert. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Decorative fabric ribbons are known, as are fabric ribbons that have been edged with wire. However, the prior art wire ribbons are made by laying a wire near the edge of a fabric ribbon, folding the edge of the ribbon over the wire, and sewing or gluing down the folded edge to hold the wire in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This type of construction provides a ribbon that will retain its shape when bent, but which suffers from several significant disadvantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The folded edge in these known ribbons produces an unsightly seam, which gives the ribbon a definite front and a back, and which makes if more difficult to fashion the ribbon into pleasing shapes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> When the fabric edge is sewn down, the wire is only loosely held within a fabric sleeve, and thus it can move apart from the ribbon. This makes it more difficult to shape the ribbon, and a sliding wire can result in excess wire at one end of the ribbon and no wire at the other end. The sliding wire also makes the ribbon more difficult to control, and the ribbon is less likely to retain its shape over time. Side to side slippage of the wire can also cause undesirable bunching and/or buckling of the fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Similar problems arise when glue is used. Although some glues may help keep the wire firmly in place, in general the bond is weak and cannot withstand the stress of normal use. Thus, the wire will eventually separate from the glue and ribbon over time, or when the ribbon is bent, twisted or tied in use. In addition, the application of the glue and the remove of excess glue results in significant production and quality control problems. For example, excess glue can deface the fabric ribbon, and glues of sufficient strength to hold the wire in place can degrade the fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another known method involves loosely sealing a wire between two laminated and/or embossed surfaces, which disadvantageously requires the use of two independent fabric surfaces. These ribbons typically are bulky and have an unsightly rear face. Additionally, the two surfaces have a tendency to separate, which defeats the purpose of having a reliable wired ribbon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In view of these disadvantages, a need has arisen for an improved decorative wired ribbon, especially one that provides a firm and integral union of fabric and wire, without the undesirable folds, seams and glue of prior ribbons. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to overcome the disadvantages of known wired ribbons, by providing a fabric or plastic tubular ribbon edged with wire and bound with trim, so that the wire is hidden from view and yet is firmly affixed to the ribbon without folds, seams or glue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is also another objective of the invention to show that after the ribbon has been made tubular it can be filled with electric lighting or any other product that allows for bending and shaping and creating a decorative tube or ribbon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is also another objective of the invention to provide a method of making tubular ribbons edged with wire and bound with decorative trim. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is yet another objective to provide an apparatus for making the tubiform ribbons of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is provided a tubiform wired ribbon that includes a first layer of ribbon material having a first edge and a second edge and a second layer of ribbon material having a first edge and a second edge. The first and second layers overlay one another such that their respective first and second edges are in substantial alignment and form a first ribbon edge and a second ribbon edge, respectively. The tubiform wired ribbon also includes a first wire filament aligned longitudinally adjacent the first ribbon edge. The first wire filament is attached to the ribbon by a first trim filament looped around said first wire filament and the first ribbon edge and a first binding filament that passes through the first and second layers of ribbon material for securing the first trim filament to said first and second layers of ribbon material adjacent the first ribbon edge. In this manner the first wire filament is held in place along said first ribbon edge and the first edges of the first and second layers of ribbon material are bound together. A second wire filament is attached to an opposite edge of the ribbon in the same manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the tubiform wired ribbon according to this invention, a decorative insert, such as string of electric lights, is provided between the two layers of ribbon fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention there is provided an apparatus for making a decorative tubiform wired ribbon. The apparatus includes a stitching apparatus that has a work plate, a needle, a filament looper, and a needle plate disposed within and generally coplanar with the work plate. The needle plate is positioned above the filament looper and for the needle to pass therethrough. The needle plate has a tine that extends in a stitching direction. The apparatus also includes means for feeding a tubiform wired ribbon as set forth above through the stitching apparatus and means for drawing the tubiform wired ribbon through the stitching apparatus. A feed tube is mounted on the stitching apparatus adjacent to the tubiform wired ribbon feeding means so that a decorative insert can be inserted into the tubiform wired ribbon as it is drawn through the stitching apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of making a decorative tubiform wired ribbon. The method includes the step of overlaying a first ply of a ribbon fabric having first and second edges and a second ply of a ribbon fabric having first and second edges such that the first and second edges of each ply are substantially aligned. The said first and second plies thus form a layered ribbon. A first wire filament is positioned along the first edge of the layered ribbon and is attached to the first edge of the layered ribbon in a continuous operation as follows. A first trim filament is looped around the first wire filament and the first edge of the layered ribbon and a first binding filament is passed through the layered ribbon to secure the first trim filament to the layered ribbon adjacent the first edge thereof. In this manner, the first wire filament is held in place along the first edge of the layered ribbon and the first edges of the first and second layers of ribbon fabric are bound together. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The tubiform ribbon of the invention is fabricated with two or panels pieces of fabric, a wire filament, at least one decorative or trim filament, and at least one binding filament. The trim and wire filament are firmly bound and affixed to the fabric by the binding filament. In a preferred embodiment, this is achieved in one simultaneous and continuous operation. Also, the binding filament is preferably chosen and the trim filament is applied in a size, quantity and manner such that the wire filament and binding filament are both substantially or even completely hidden by the trim filament. The tubiform ribbon may also include a decorative insert such as a string of electric lights encapsulated therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> This arrangement provides a seamless stitched border that holds the wire filament in place without slippage, and without intermediate folding, gluing, embossing or laminating steps. The seamless stitched border can be formed in a single continuous operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The ribbon fabric can be any known fabric, either textile or plastic, and either flat or pleated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Preferred finished ribbon sizes according to the invention are widths of 4&Prime;, 6&Prime;, 10&Prime; up to 45&Prime;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Pleated fabric can be obtained from flat fabric, for use in this invention, according to known means of pleating or texturing fabrics. Typically, a flat fabric is run through a pleating machine that is provides with knives. The fabric is scored with the knives, to produce the textured or pleated effect, which is preserved by heat treating the scored fabric to a temperature of about 250-300&deg; F. The pleated fabric is sandwiched between holding paper and rolled for storage, so that the pleats retain their shape without damage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The wire filament can be any flexible filament that will hold its shape without breaking when bent or twisted. The preferred wire filament of the invention is galvanized steel, which can range in gauge from about 20 to 32. The wire filament should be both strong and light, and the preferred size for ribbons ranging in width from 4 to 45 inches, is gauge 20 galvanized steel wire. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The trim filament of the invention can be any known decorative thread of a suitable strength and thickness, which can be wound around the wire filament and through the fabric on a needle, without breaking or snagging, and with enough weight and body to substantially or completely cover the wire filament. Metallic threads are particularly suitable, especially those comprising a metallic strand wrapped with one or two nylon strands. It has been found that a metallic strand that is {fraction (1/69)}th of an inch thick, or about <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> gauge, that is wrapped with one, or preferably two strands of 70 denier nylon strands is especially preferred. Non-metallic threads can also be used. According to the invention, threads ranging in thickness from {fraction (1/100)}th to {fraction (1/50)}th of an inch, and wrapped with one or two strands (or ends) of nylon ranging from 50 to 90 denier can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The binding filament can be any filament chosen for strength and light weight, and preferably is one strand of monofilament ranging in thickness from 0.005 mil. to 0.009 mil. The preferred monofilament is 0.007 mil. in thickness. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The novel decorative ribbon of the invention is made by binding the wire filament and the trim filament to the fabric ribbon with the binding filament in one operation that both fixes the wire to the edge of the fabric, and hides the wire from view by covering it with turns of trim filament. This is done on a feed-driven stitching machine that is specially modified according to the invention, as further described below. Thus, the stitching machine supplies the fabric ribbon with a coextensive length of wire filament that is simultaneously bound to the fabric by the binding filament and covered over by the trim filament. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to the same components across the several views, and in particular to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a portion of a tubiform ribbon including an edge wire secured according to the present invention. The ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a first ply <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a second ply <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having edges <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>respectively. An actual edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed by the alignment of edges <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. In this particular embodiment, a galvanized steel wire filament <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is positioned along the actual edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The wire filament <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is secured to the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by a sewing stitch, such as the purl stitch shown. In this embodiment, the stitch includes two filaments, a decorative trim filament <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a binding filament <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The purpose of the trim filament <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is to substantially or entirely cover the wire filament <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the actual edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, thereby providing a clean, continuous and decorative edging to the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This can be achieved, as shown, by applying the trim filament <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a curved serpentine fashion over both the wire filament <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the actual edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The serpentine shape of the trim filament includes loops <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> During the stitching process, the binding filament <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> pierces the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and inter-weaves through the serpentine loops <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the trim filament <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to bind the trim filament <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the ribbon fabric. The binding filament <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is kept taut during the stitching process, and the trim filament <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the interposed edge portion of the ribbon are pulled into engagement with the inner wire filament <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this way, the decorative trim filament <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> becomes substantially wrapped around the otherwise exposed edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, all of which are securely bound together by the binding filament <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Thus, the tight stitch created by the binding and trim filaments, acting together, not only secures the wire filament <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, but also provides a decorative edging to the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the binding filament is a natural monofilament, chosen for its strength and also to be effectively invisible. This allows the trim filament to be prominently seen, so that the ribbon is provided with a securely wired and decorative edge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A similar arrangement of wire filament, decorative or trim filament and binding filament is applied in a similar manner to the opposite edge of ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this way the resulting tubiform ribbon product has a tightly secured hidden wire filament <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along each edge of the ribbon material to support the ribbon&apos;s shape, and a decoratively disguised stitch that provides an attractive edging on each side of the ribbon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a portion of a partially finished ribbon according to the invention having one edge wired, and stitched together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the present invention provides an improved adaptation to a conventional high speed stitching machine to create the secured wire ribbon-edge arrangement of the present invention. Two examples of conventional high speed stitching machines are the Merrow High Speed Trimming &amp; Overseaming Machine manufactured by the Merrow Company of Hartford, Conn., and the Pegasus S32 manufactured by the Pegasus Sewing Machine Manufacturing Co., Ltd. of Osaka, Japan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the stitching machine <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is adjacent to guide rollers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes a work plate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for supporting the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The machine <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also includes a moveable sewing needle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, a feed carrier <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for feeding the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and a needle plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which is recessed into and generally coplanar with the work plate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The guide rollers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are preferably power driven using conventional methods so that the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is drawn from the work plate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the stitching machine <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in synchronization with the stitching operation. The purpose of the rollers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is to maintain tension and prevent buckling in the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during stitching and after it has been stitched. If the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not pulled from the stitching machine <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the stitch can become distorted or otherwise uneven and unattractive and the various elements of the invention, such as the ribbon, wire and filaments, will not be secured in a satisfactory manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The drive speed of the rollers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is dictated by the feed rate established by the internal feed carrier <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, typically protruding from within the needle plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The feed carrier <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> pulls one ply of ribbon material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from an upper supply roll <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> and a second ply of ribbon material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>from a lower supply roll <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</cross-reference>. As the two-plies of ribbon material <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are drawn into the stitching apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, they are pulled through a pair of guide bars <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and a pair of guiders <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, to vertically and horizontally align the two-plies for stitching. It is conventionally known that the drive speed of the guide rollers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the feedrate of the feed carrier <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> should be matched during high speed edge stitching so that the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be drawn from the supply rolls, stitched, and drawn in a smooth flow. The ribbon may subsequently be drawn onto a collection roll, or some other means of storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A typical edge stitch comprises two filaments of thread. One thread is usually supplied to the fabric, which in this case is ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, by &ldquo;loopers&rdquo; from below the needle plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, while the other thread is fed to the needle <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> from above the needle plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In the process according to the present invention, the first thread below the needle plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is preferably the trim filament <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the second thread, which is fed to the needle above the needle plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, is preferably the binding filament <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The normal operation of the stitching machine <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provides a conventional stitch by interweaving the binding filament <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with the trim filament <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as further described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a wire filament <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided within the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, before the stitch is produced by the stitching machine <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. An apparatus according to the present invention includes a needle plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which has been modified such that a wire filament <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be guided and applied in a controlled manner onto the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during the stitching process. The needle plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the present invention is shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The needle plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a top portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> having fabric engagement teeth <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, a feed carrier access slot <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, a fabric support tine <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> for supporting the fabric adjacent to the moving needle, and a needle stitching slot <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>. The needle plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> also includes a side portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and a bottom portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The side portion <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a side groove <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> along the side of the support tine <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The side groove <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is of proper dimensions to effectively guide a sliding wire filament <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of a chosen size from a wire filament source to the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, specifically along the ribbon&apos;s edge. A similarly shaped bottom groove <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is disposed substantially inline with that of the side groove <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the wire filament <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is guided by both side and bottom grooves without stress or deformation. The wire filament <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is first guided from its source, and under the work plate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by the bottom groove <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> along the bottom portion of the needle plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and then, by the side groove <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> along the side of the support tine <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> adjacent to the top portion of the needle plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> where it is easily positioned on the ribbon&apos;s edge <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and secured to the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during the stitching process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In operation, a supply of an appropriate decorative trim filament <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a supply of binding filament <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are loaded in a conventional manner into a standard stitching machine, like the preferred Merrow or Pegasus machine. The wire filament <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is fed through the needle plate <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, guided by both the side groove <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the bottom groove <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and is ultimately drawn with the ribbon by the rollers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is positioned in a conventional manner onto the work plate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the stitching machine <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The previously described stitch is then produced around the edges and the enclosed wire <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The stitching process creates the necessary pull required to ensure tight engagement between the wire filament <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The tightness of the stitch can be regulated by adjusting the cams of the stitching machine. In a preferred embodiment, the cams are adjusted so that the trim filament is wrapped tightly, with each turn of the filament just touching or overlapping each adjacent turn, so that the wire and the edge of the ribbon are covered over. It will also be appreciated by skilled practitioners that more than one trim filament or binding filament can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Preferably, one or two trim filaments is used and one binding filament is used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> An alternative method of binding the edges of the two-ply ribbon may be used. In the alternative technique a strip of fabric is folded over the edge of the decorative ribbon so as to straddle the wire filament and the edges of the fabric layers. The strip is drawn along with the ribbon by the stitching machine and stitched so that the wire filament is encapsulated and the edges of the ribbon fabric are bound together. The strand is stitched to the ribbon with a binding filament in a similar manner as previously described using a single needle stitch. If desired, one or more trim filaments may be stitched to the fabric along with the binding filament. The width of the fabric strand is preferably about &frac14; inch, such that when folded it overlaps the edge of the decorative ribbon by approximately &frac18; inch. However, any width of strand may be used as would be desired depending on the particular application. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The above procedure is then duplicated, with modifications as described following, to stitch the opposite edge of the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and complete the tubiform wired ribbon. In this stage of the process, the decorative insert is encapsulated between the two plies of the ribbon fabric. Preferably, the decorative insert is a string of lights. However, other inserts could be used such as a string of LED&apos;s, confetti, glitter, or decorative shapes. If desired a decorative ribbon or yarn could be inserted. Of course, combinations of such decorative inserts could also be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the process for performing the closing and encapsulating steps utilizes the same sewing equipment described above. A tubular member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is disposed at the front of the sewing machine to allow a string of electric lights <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to pass inside of the two-ply ribbon while the fabric or plastic surrounds the tubular member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> leading it toward the sewing machine <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Tubular member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is mounted on a spring loaded holder <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>, which is pivotable so that tubular member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be rotated out of the way for non-encapsulating stitching processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The stitching apparatus <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> closes the second edge of the ribbon <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the same procedure as described above, thereby encapsulating the light string <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> within the tubiform ribbon. A section of the completed ribbon is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The tubiform wired ribbon was created to form a new decorative ribbon product with electric lights or other decorative insert to create a dynamic and unique product electric wired ribbon. This product can be used indoors and outdoors when fabricated from plastic. All lights are and should be UL approved for indoor and outdoor applications. All plastic fabric utilized in the decorative ribbon according to this invention is preferably water-proof, mildew-proof, and fade resistant. Fabrics other than plastic should be specially treated for flame-retardancy and used in conjunction with UL approved lighting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been described in terms of the foregoing exemplary embodiments, variations within the scope and spirit of the present invention as defined by the claims following will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. </paragraph>
