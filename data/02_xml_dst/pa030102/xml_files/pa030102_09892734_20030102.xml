<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention mainly relates to an upper beam structure for a Roman type blind. It is made up of an upper beam, a pair of stuffing blocks, a hanging seat, a hanging retainer seat, a cloth curtain and two pull cords. The upper beam is a rectangular tube having a partitioned front receiving room and a rear receiving room axially extended the full length thereof. On a side wall or the bottom of the front receiving room and the bottom of the rear receiving room is disposed a longitudinal slot opening respectively via which the cloth curtain passes. The cloth curtain is engaged with an engagement retainer plate or block at the top edge thereof which is placed and just housed in the front receiving room via the opened end with ease and speed. At the top of the rear receiving room of the upper beam is disposed a slot at each end so as to permit pivot necks disposed at the top of a hanging seat and a hanging retainer seat to stick out thereof and hook member to be easily attached thereto from outside in assembly. The pull cords of the cloth curtain can be easily held in place by a hanging retainer seat housed in the rear receiving room. Thereby the assembly of a blind can be simple, speedy and time saving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Generally, the Roman type blind <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for indoor use, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is comprised of an upper beam <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of a proper length and a rectangular cloth curtain <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> whose upper edge is wound around and sewn in a way to engage with the upper beam <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and further fixed in place by rivets at both ends of the upper beam <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so as to permit the cloth curtain <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to naturally drape down. At an equal distance of the cloth curtain are disposed a folded rib <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Positioning rings are sewn to the rear side of the top and bottom folded ribs <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. A hanging device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is secured at each end of the upper beam <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Each hanging device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided with a pivot hook <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> so as to permit the Roman type blind <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be attached to nails a fixed to a wall above a window. At each end of the upper beam <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are disposed a pair of pull cords <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> (only one pair of cords shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). At the bottom end of the pull cords <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is respectively disposed a cap <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. The pull cords are engaged with the positioning rings so that the pull of the pull cords permits the piling collection of the cloth curtain <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the pull cords <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can be held in place by a retaining device b disposed next to the blind. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Such a prior art structure has the following disadvantages in use: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 1. The cloth curtain <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is engaged with the upper beam <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in a rather tedious and complex manner by sewing and riveting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 2. The hanging devices <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are fixed to each end of the upper beam <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by screws, and the fixing of the hanging device <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the upper beam <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is troublesome and time consuming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 3. The pull cords <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are not fixed in place when the cloth curtain <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is collected, only the retaining device b is used to hold the pull cords <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which are wound around the retaining device b; it is relatively inconvenient, difficult, time consuming and not secure enough. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRD EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the Roman type blind is mainly comprised of an upper beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a pair of stuffing blocks <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, a hanging seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a hanging retainer seat <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a cloth curtain <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and two pull cords <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The upper beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a tube of proper length and has a longitudinally extended and partitioned front and rear receiving rooms <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which have a slot opening <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> axially extended the full length thereof with an inwardly bent flange <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> respectively. On the ceiling of the rear receiving room <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is disposed a slot <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> at each end thereof. The hanging seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a C-shaped form having a front and rear wall with a supporting rod disposed therebetween for connection. A pivot neck <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> engaged with a hook member <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is disposed on the rear wall of the hanging seat. The hanging retainer seat <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a front and rear wall connected end to end with a supporting rod disposed therebetween. On the rear wall is disposed a pivot neck <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> with a hanging hook <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> attached thereto and between the walls and next to the supporting rod is disposed a positioning roller gear <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight>. A limiting stick <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is located in the space between the two walls and near a bottom thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The cloth curtain <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is a piece of rectangular cloth of proper width with a engagement retainer plate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> secured to the top edge thereof. The engagement retainer plate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is smaller in dimension of the front receiving room <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and the thickness is slightly larger than the slot opening <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> at the bottom of the front receiving room <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. At equal distance from the top to the bottom edge of the cloth curtain <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are disposed a plurality of folded and sewn drape pieces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which drape down naturally. On the back side of the top and bottom drape pieces <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and in alignment with the two slots <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the upper beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are disposed positioning rings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In assembly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference>, the hanging seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the hanging retainer seat <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are first located into the rear receiving room <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the upper beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the respective opened end. Then the hanging seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the hanging retainer seat <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are located under the respective slot <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> of the upper beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with the pivot neck portions thereof projected out of the slots <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> so as to permit the hook members <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> to be externally engaged with the hanging seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the hanging retainer seat <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> respectively, resulting in the fixing of the hanging seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the hanging retainer seat <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> individually in the rear receiving room <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the upper beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Afterwards, the engagement retainer plate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> disposed at the top edge of the cloth curtain <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is fully led into the front receiving room <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the upper beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with ease and speed from the opened end thereof so as to permit the cloth curtain <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to drape naturally downwardly under the slot opening <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>. The stuffing blocks <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are respectively attached to each open end of the upper beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The bottom ends of the two pull cords <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are respectively fixed to the positioning rings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> disposed at each end of the bottom drape piece <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the cloth curtain <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>; and the top ends of the pull cords <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are led upwardly through the respective positioning rings <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> disposed at the top drape piece <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the cloth curtain <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and further guided into and wound in the hanging seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the hanging retaining seat <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> individually. Afterwards, they are commonly led into the hanging retainer seat <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and out of the same from the bottom thereof to form a pull handle <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to complete the assembly of the Roman type blind. Then, the blind can be secured to nails fixed to the wall area above the upper beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, by way of the hook members <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the hanging seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the hanging retainer seat <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Thereby, the hand actuation of the pull handle <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> of the pull cords <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can cause the positioning roller gear <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to shift into locking engagement with the limiting stick <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> so as to hold the pull cords <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in position with ease, readiness and precision after the cloth curtain <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is collected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Moreover, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, in a second embodiment of the present invention, the engagement retainer plate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> is replaced with the engagement retainer block <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>&prime; which is of an oval shaped cross section and is only slightly smaller than the space of the front receiving room <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the upper beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so as to permit the retainer block <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>&prime; to be easily, quickly and securely located in the front receiving room <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> without detachment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In addition, the slot opening <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> disposed at the bottom of the front receiving room <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the upper beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be replaced by another front side slot opening <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>&prime; disposed at the front wall of the front receiving room with a vertical flange <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>&prime; above the front side slot opening <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>&prime;, as shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the engagement retainer plate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> or the engagement retainer block <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>&prime; can be put into the respective front receiving rooms <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of various sizes which are just slightly larger than the dimension of the engagement retainer plate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> or block <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>&prime; so that they can be firmly and securely retained in the front receiving room <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> after the engagement retainer plate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> or block <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>&prime; is guided into the front receiving room <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> from the side opened end of the upper beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with ease and speed with the cloth curtain <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> passing via the front side slot opening <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>&prime; of the front receiving room <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. It can effect the same functional purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> From the preceding description of the embodiments, the following advantages can be apparently seen: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> 1. The cloth curtain <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is engaged with the upper beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> simply by way of the engagement retainer plate <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> or block <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>&prime; which are led easily and quickly into the upper beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from one side opened end with the cloth curtain <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> passing via the bottom slot opening <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> or side slot opening <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>&prime;, making the assembly and mounting easy, speedy and time consuming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> 2. The hanging seat <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the hanging retainer seat <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are guided into the upper beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from both ends and are located easily and precisely in position by sticking the pivotal necks with the hooks <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> out of the slots <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> defined at the top surface of the rear receiving room <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the upper beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> 3. The cloth curtain <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be easily collected and the pull cords <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are easily held in place by way of the hanging retainer seat <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the upper beam without using an addition retaining means secured to a wall section next to the blind, making the mounting easy and the external appearance appealing to eyes. </paragraph>
