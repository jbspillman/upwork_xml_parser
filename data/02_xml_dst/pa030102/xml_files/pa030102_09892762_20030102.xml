<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a tire pressure indicator and, more particularly, to a diaphragm-type tire pressure indicator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, a tire pressure indicator is provided for warning insufficient tire pressure, thereby ensuring the safety in driving a vehicle. In such an indicating device, a flexible piston device is generally used to move forwards/backwards subject to the condition of the tire pressure of a vehicle tire, so as to sense the pressure of the tire and thus detect whether the pressure is too low. This conventional tire pressure indicator produces only a small friction during movement of the piston, and the tire pressure indication is relatively accurate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,492 granted to the present inventor discloses a diaphragm-type pressure measuring device, which uses a diaphragm to detect the tire pressure of the vehicle tire. Similar tire pressure indicators are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,945,337, 5,014,643, 5,025,244, 5,289,161, and 5,694,111, for monitoring the tire pressure condition of vehicle tires. These tire pressure indicators are designed subject to different manners in warning low tire pressures. Therefore, based on different tire pressure warning requirements, various tire pressure warning devices, which are different in structures and are assembled in different manners, must be manufactured. As a result, the manufacturing process cannot be simplified and the manufacturing cost is high. Therefore, it is desired for the above conventional tire pressure indicators to be improved, so as to mitigate and/or obviate the aforementioned problems. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a diaphragm-type tire pressure indicator in accordance with the present invention, which includes a casing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a movable diaphragm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a sleeve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, an adjustment cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a washer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and a cover <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the movable diaphragm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably a flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has one end integral with the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the diaphragm <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be a corrugated metal diaphragm or a bellows. The cover <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is made of transparent material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the casing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a receiving chamber <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a coupling unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The coupling unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a press rod <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, and is mounted with a gasket ring <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is mounted in the receiving chamber <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is integrally connected to the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, so as to be moved up or down according to the expansion or collapse of the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is mounted in the receiving chamber <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is sleeved onto the push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has a mounting base <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a wrinkled expansible portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> peripherally connected to the mounting base <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The mounting base <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is positioned at the bottom end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The sleeve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has an inside flange <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and an outside flange <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has an outward flange <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> radially extended from the bottom edge thereof and fixedly fastened to the expansible portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The washer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is sleeved onto the push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and supported on the outward flange <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The spring <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is sleeved onto the push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and pressed against the washer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the inside flange <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The transparent cover <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is covered on the outside flange <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> over the adjustment cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. A through hole <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is provided on the transparent cover <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The present diaphragm type tire pressure indicator provides a micro-calibration function. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> again, the adjustment cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is screwed to the top end <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> extends out of the adjustment cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. By means of adjusting the elevational position of the adjustment cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on the top end <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the sleeve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the protruding length of the push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> outside the adjustment cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is relatively adjusted, and the calibration of the diaphragm-type tire pressure indicator can be achieved. Therefore, all the diaphragm-type tire pressure indicators to be manufactured can be calibrated to minimize the tolerance, thereby ensuring the accuracy of the manufactured tire pressure indicator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In use of the present tire pressure indicator, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the coupling unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the diaphragm-type tire pressure indicator is fastened to the air nozzle <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of a tire <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, thereby enabling internal gas of the tire <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to pass through an air hole <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> in the coupling unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the casing <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into the receiving chamber <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, so as to move the expansible portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Thus, the push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is moved subject to the air pressure of the tire <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>; i.e., the push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is lifted when the air pressure of the tire <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is increased, or lowered when the air pressure of the tire <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is reduced. The push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be marked with different colors or with graduations to indicate whether the sensed tire pressure is sufficient or not. For example, the push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be colored with yellow, green, and red, or marked with data units at different elevations. The adjustment cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> serves as the reference unit. By means of the indication of the adjustment cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the user can visually check the amount and direction of the movement of the push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> relative to the adjustment cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, thereby conveniently determining whether the tire pressure is sufficient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>A show another preferred embodiment of the diaphragm-type tire pressure indicator according to the present invention. This embodiment is similar to the previous one, in addition to having a conductive member <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> mounted on the adjustment cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a circuit board <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> mounted on the conductive member <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, a light emitting diode <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> installed in the circuit board <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, a battery seat <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> mounted on the push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to hold a battery cell <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight>, and a conductive spring <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> disposed between the circuit board <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the battery cell <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> in the battery seat <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The battery seat <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> has a bottom screw rod <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> threaded into the screw hole on the top end of the push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The conductive member <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is preferred to be of a cylindrical shape and has an inward bottom flange <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> fixedly fastened to the adjustment cap <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The light emitting diode <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> has one terminal connected to the conductive spring <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, and the other terminal connected to a conductor <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight> which is provided at the bottom edge of the circuit board <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and disposed in contact with the conductive member <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A further micro-calibration function of the diaphragm-type tire pressure indicator can be achieved by means of rotating the bottom screw rod <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> upwards or downwards in the screw hole on the push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The battery cell <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> has one electrode disposed in contact with the conductive spring <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, and the other electrode electrically connected to the battery seat <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. In assembling, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the transparent cover <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is covered on the sleeve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to secure the circuit board <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on the conductive member <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The battery seat <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is thus received in the space defined between the circuit board <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the conductive member <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. The diameter of the battery seat <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is greater than the diameter of the space surrounded by the inward flange <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> of the conductive member <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the battery seat <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, when being lowered down, contacts the inward flange <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> of the conductive member <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, causing the battery cell <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> and the light emitting diode <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> to form a circuit loop, and thus the light emitting diode <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> is turned on to emit light. On the contrary, the battery seat <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>, when being lifted, is electrically disconnected from the conductive member <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to turn off the light emitting diode <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>. The elevation of the push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is changed subject to the value of the air pressure of the tire <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>; i.e., the push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is lowered when the air pressure of the tire <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is reduced. When the air pressure of the tire <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> drops below a predetermined value, the battery seat <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is lowered with the push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to touch the inward flange <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> of the conductive member <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, causing the light emitting diode <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> to emit light, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. Therefore, the user knows immediately the low pressure status of the tire <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> by viewing the lighting status of the light emitting diode <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> even from a long distance away. In this preferred embodiment, the battery seat <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is lowered down or lifted up by the flexible diaphragm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> in the same way as the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, and thus a detailed description for the operation of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is deemed unnecessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>A show a further preferred embodiment of the diaphragm-type tire pressure indicator according to the present invention. This embodiment is similar to the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4, 5A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>B except that an RF transmitter module <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> is installed in the circuit board <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> instead of the aforesaid light emitting diode <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the cover <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of this embodiment is not necessary to be transparent. Thus, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>B, wen the battery seat <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> is lowered with the push rod <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to touch the inward flange <highlight><bold>611</bold></highlight> of the conductive member <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> due to a low air pressure of the tire <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, the power of the battery cell <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> is supplied to the RF transmitter module <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> so as to emit an RF signal, indicating a low tire pressure, to an RF receiver module in the car (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference>, the RF transmitter module <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> includes a memory <highlight><bold>6251</bold></highlight> for storing an RF transmitter ID code and tire code, a control circuit <highlight><bold>6252</bold></highlight>, and a transmitting circuit <highlight><bold>6253</bold></highlight>. When the power of the battery cell <highlight><bold>631</bold></highlight> is supplied to the RF transmitter module <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> upon low pressure of the tire, the control circuit fetches the ID code of the RF transmitter module <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> and the tire code of the tire that is installed with the RF transmitter module <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> is installed, and then drives the transmitting circuit <highlight><bold>6253</bold></highlight> to send a radio signal carrying the &verbar;ID code and the tire code. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</cross-reference> are system block diagram and circuit diagram of an RF receiver module <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> installed in the car respectively and adapted to be used with the aforesaid RF transmitter module <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight>. The RF receiver module <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> comprises a memory <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> for storing the data of the ID code of the RF transmitter module <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> and the tire code, a control circuit <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight>, a receiving circuit <highlight><bold>953</bold></highlight>, a display device <highlight><bold>954</bold></highlight>, and a buzzer <highlight><bold>955</bold></highlight>. Upon receipt of the radio signal from the RF transmitter module <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight>, the control circuit <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight> fetches the data from the memory <highlight><bold>951</bold></highlight> for comparing with the data of the radio signal received from the RF transmitter module <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight>, so as to determine whether a signal is correctly received and recognize the tire with a low pressure. When recognized, a low tire pressure message is shown on the display device <highlight><bold>954</bold></highlight>, or the control circuit <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight> drives the buzzer <highlight><bold>955</bold></highlight> to give an audio alarm signal. In this preferred embodiment, the display device <highlight><bold>954</bold></highlight> is an LCD (liquid crystal display) <highlight><bold>9541</bold></highlight> for showing the tire pressure status by graphics. Alternatively, the display device <highlight><bold>954</bold></highlight> can be a set of LEDs (light emitting diodes) <highlight><bold>9542</bold></highlight>, each representing a tire, so that an LED <highlight><bold>9542</bold></highlight> is turned on to indicate that the pressure of a specific tire is too low. Therefore, the user needs not to get off the car when checking the status of tire pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In view of the foregoing, the present invention is able to implement a diaphragm-type tire pressure indicator with a simplified structure for alarming the low pressure status of a tire by color, graduation, light, or radio signal. Furthermore, the present invention is able to provide a micro-calibration function or a double micro-calibration function. Thus, the diaphragm-type tire pressure indicator is accurate and easy to be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Although the particular embodiments of the invention have been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The invention is not to be limited by the aforementioned embodiments except by the appended claims. </paragraph>
