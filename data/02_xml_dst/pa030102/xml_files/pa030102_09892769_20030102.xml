<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The invention will now be described based on the preferred embodiments, which do not intend to limit the scope of the present invention, but exemplify the invention. All of the features and the combinations thereof described in the embodiment are not necessarily essential to the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a structure of a delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the present invention. The delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives images from a plurality of users, and produces for each user a computer-readable recording medium such as a CD-R, MO or the like, in such a manner that the recording medium for each user stores one or more images of the user and no images of the other users. The thus produced recording medium is then delivered to a place specified by the corresponding user. The delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> configure a system for producing a recording medium in which an image captured by the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> serving as a capturing device recited in the claims includes at least a capturing unit operable to capture an image of an object and a controller operable to control at least operations of the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in accordance with at least one program stored in the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> stores the image captured thereby in, for example, a memory attached to the camera. The digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may communicate with each other by short-distance radio communication, such as bluetooth. The digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may control the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to communicate with the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, thereby transmitting the image data taken by the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the stored program, the transmission of the image data is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The transmission of the image may be performed by the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in accordance with the program stored in the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> automatically or may be performed manually by the user at appropriate times. In an example, the automatic transmission of the image is performed based upon a time that has passed after the image was captured or the number of the images that were captured by the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and are stored in the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the automatic transmission may be performed at predetermined intervals, for example, every one month. That is, when the controller of the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> determines that one month has passed after the previous transmission, the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> transmits the image data stored therein. In the manual transmission, when the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> receives the user&apos;s instruction to transmit the image(s) stored in the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the image(s) are transmitted to the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may transmit only selected ones of the images taken by the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, instead of transmitting all the images stored therein. The user may select the images to be transmitted in various manners. For example, in a case where the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a display for displaying the captured image, the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may display the images that were captured and stored therein so as to help the user to select the image to be transmitted. In another case where the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a display, the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may control the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to display the image captured by the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in accordance with program stored in the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, so as to help the user to select the image to be transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> As the program, the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> stores at least a program including: a connection-detecting module that makes the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> detect connection established between the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>; a calling module that makes the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to call a predetermined number so as to communicate with the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; and a transmitting module that makes the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> transmit the image data stored in the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In a case where the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> transmits the images data when the number of the images captured and stored therein reaches a predetermined figure, the program may further include a monitoring module that makes the controller or another component of the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> monitor the number of the images captured by the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> so as to determine whether or not the number reaches the predetermined digure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> When the images kept in the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are transmitted, a phone number of the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the user or an e-mail address of the user, and the shot date each image was taken by the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may obtain position information regarding a position of the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by using a GPS (Global Positioning System). When capturing an image, the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> records the position thereof together. The recorded position is transmitted to the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> together with the captured image. The recording and the transmission of the position information are performed in accordance with program stored in the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Moreover, position information regarding a position of the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be obtained by providing the GPS with the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In this case, the obtained position information is transmitted together with the images taken by the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The transmission of the position information is performed in accordance with the program stored in the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a delivery-medium recording apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, an image keeping-processing apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, an image receiving unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, an image converting unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, a converted image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, a kept image database <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, a payment-mode receiving unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a payment processing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, an extra-printing-request receiving unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, an extra printing unit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and an image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The image receiving unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> receives the images transmitted from a plurality of users via the mobile phones <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The image receiving unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also receives, for each image, image-associated information such as the e-mail address of the corresponding user, the shot date, and the shot place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The image keeping-processing apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> writes the images received by the image receiving unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> onto the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, for example, a hard disk, and also writes, for each image, the image associated information received by the image receiving unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and an image ID created from the image-associated information in the kept image database <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The image keeping-processing apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> also reads data of the image from the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Next, the kept image database <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is described referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an exemplary kept image database <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> included in the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the kept image database <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, an image ID, a shot date and a shot place of the corresponding image, and a type indicating whether the corresponding image is a digital transmitted image or an image obtained from a negative film are stored for each user ID. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The image ID is created by using information unique to the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that is used for transmitting the corresponding image, such as a phone number of the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, or information unique to the user who transmits the corresponding image, such as an e-mail address thereof, and the captured date. In a case of the image received from the user having the e-mail address is xxx&commat;xxx.jp and the captured date is Jan. 1, 2000, 1 p.m., the image ID of xxx&commat;xxx.jp200001011300 is created, for example. In this manner, the image ID is assigned to each of the images stored in the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. By specifying the image ID, one of the images kept that has the specified image ID can be identified. Moreover, when the image ID is used as a file name of the image stored in the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, it is possible to easily manage the images kept by the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes the image converting unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the converted image keeping-processing unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The converted image keeping-processing unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> receives a negative film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of a photograph shot by a camera that records a photographic image onto a film. The converted image keeping-processing unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> sends the received negative film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to the image converting unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The image converting unit <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> converts an image recorded onto the negative film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> into a digital image by using an image reading apparatus such as a scanner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The negative film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be brought by the user to a place which furnishes the converted image keeping-processing unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The place may be a shop of a photo-development service, a convenience store or the like. A clerk may operate the converted image keeping-processing unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to receive the negative film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> brought by the user, or the user may operate the converted image keeping-processing unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> by oneself. Moreover, the user may bring a film roll that has not been developed yet to the development service shop or the convenience store. In this case, the negative film obtained by developing the film roll is received by the converted image keeping-processing unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The details of the image conversion to the digital image, for example, a type of image format, resolution or the like, is determined in accordance with a user&apos;s instruction. The user can input the user&apos;s instruction by means of a keyboard and/or a mouse (both not shown) of the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The converted image keeping-processing unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> also receives the shot date when the image recorded on the received negative film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> was taken and the user ID of the user. In a case of using the same user ID as that used for the management of the images transmitted via the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, it is advantageous to the management of the images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The converted image keeping-processing unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> writes the converted image into the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the user can make the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> produce the recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that stores the photographic image corresponding to the negative film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> by bringing the negative film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to the place where the converted image keeping-processing unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is furnished. Moreover, the image keeping-processing apparatus <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> records the shot date when the image of the negative film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> was taken onto the kept image database <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Also for the photographic image converted from the negative film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the image ID is created as in a case of the image transmitted via the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and recorded onto the kept image database <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As described above, not only the photographic image converted from the negative film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> but also the image transmitted via the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be kept by the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> of the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The information related to the kept images, for example, the shot date, is managed by referring to the kept image database <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> can accumulate the images every time a plurality of users bring the negative films <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to the place where the converted image keeping-processing unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is furnished or every time the image is transmitted via the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The delivery-medium recording apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> writes the image kept by the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> onto the recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is prepared for each of the user. That is, images of one user are recorded only onto the recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> prepared for that user, not onto the recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for other users. The images kept by the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> include the images transmitted via the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the images converted from the negative film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, as described above. Thus, the delivery-medium recording apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can create the recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in which both the transmitted images and the converted images are stored. The delivery-medium recording apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> performs the recording operation, for example, at a time when a new image is received, when a predetermined time period has passed after the previous recording operation, or when the number of the stored images for each user reaches a predetermined number. In the third case, the recording operation can be performed efficiently. Moreover, the delivery-medium recording apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may perform the recording operation when a recording instruction to record the image (s) of the user is received from the user, for example, by e-mail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As described above, the image is recorded onto the recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> prepared for each user. In the present embodiment, the delivery-medium recording apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> refers to the user ID in the kept image database <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to extract the images corresponding to the user ID, and writes the extracted images in the recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> prepared for the user having the user ID that is referred to. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Moreover, in the writing operation for writing the images onto the recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the following operation may be additionally performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> explains the additional operation in which the images are classified based on the shot dates thereof. Kept-image extraction information <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is in form of a table created by extracting the image IDs and the shot dates of the images kept for a certain user. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the shot dates are arranged in an order from the oldest one to the newest one. Based on the thus arranged shot dates, two images having shot dates that are adjacent to each other in the arranged order are recorded onto the same recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> if an interval between the shot dates of the two images (hereinafter, referred to as &ldquo;shot interval&rdquo;) is shorter than a predetermined period, for example, one month. If the shot interval is one month or more, the two images are stored in different recording media <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In other words, all the shot intervals of the temporary adjacent two images that have two adjacent shot dates are shorter than the predetermined period, that is, one month in the present embodiment. When the shot interval of the two images having the shot dates that are adjacent to each other when being arranged in the order from the oldest one to the newest one, is equal to or longer than the predetermined period, a new recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is produced. This is because the shot interval equal to or longer than the predetermined period can be interpreted as indicating that an object of the older one of the images is different from an object of the newer one. According to this classification, for example, images taken during a trip are recorded together in Disk 1 whereas images taken during another trip are recorded together in Disk 2, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Accordingly, the user can obtain the recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> storing the images that can be collected to have the same theme or the like are stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the user may specify the images shot at places within a particular area so as to record the specified images in the same recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In this case, the recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> storing the images classified based on the shot places can be produced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The thus produced recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is delivered to a place the user specified by e-mail or the like. For example, the user can specify the user&apos;s home, a convenience store or the like, as the place to which the recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is to be delivered. In a case of the convenience store, the user goes there to receive the delivered recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The place specified by the user may be the place where the user brought the negative film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, such as the development service shop, the convenience store or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, other components are described. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The payment-mode receiving unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> receives a payment mode specified by the user. The payment processing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> charges the user for a cost required for producing the recording medium in accordance with the payment mode received by the payment-mode receiving unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. These components are described in detail later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The extra-printing-request unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> receives a request of extra-printing from the user. More specifically, the extra-printing-request unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> receives at least the image ID of the image for which a copy is to be made, and the number and the size of the copy if the user wishes to receive the copy in form of a printed image on paper. The extra-printing-request unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> sends the extra-printing request from the user to the extra-printing processing unit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> so as to make the extra-printing process unit <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> print the image specified by the image ID onto the paper by a printer <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> connecting thereto. Alternatively, the extra-printing-request unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may send the extra-printing request to the delivery-medium recording apparatus <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to record the requested image onto a new recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The printed image or the newly created recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is delivered to the place specified by the user, as described above. The place to which the extra-printed image or the new recording medium is to be delivered may be a shop, a convenience store, or a place to which the user brought the negative film. In this way, the user can obtain the copy of the image by using the user&apos;s desired medium, that is, the paper or the recording medium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the user can obtain a greeting card by using the above-mentioned extra-printing operation. More specifically, when the user specifies the details of the extra-printing, that is, the image ID of the image to be extra-printed and the number and the size of the copy of the image, the user requests to create the greeting card that uses the image specified by the image ID. In this case, for example, the user can easily obtain the desired number of greeting cards using the specified image and, if necessary, including a message. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Next, the manner of determining which image is to be extra-printed is described. In an example, the recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that the user has already received may include the image ID for each image, which is linked to a predetermined web page on the Internet. In this case, the user can easily send the extra-printing-request receiving unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> the extra-printing request including the image ID, the number and the size of the copy of the image if the user wishes to receive the printed copy, or the like, by clicking the image ID of the requested image. In an alternative example, the image IDs of the images kept by the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may be sent to the user by e-mail or the like. The e-mail may be sent to the user&apos;s computer or the mobile phone that can send/receive e-mail. In this case, the user looks up the image IDs so as to determine the image ID of the image for which the extra-printing is to be requested, and sends the extra-printing request to the extra-printing-request receiving unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> of the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In a further alternative example, in a case where the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a display such as an LCD, thumbnail images of the images kept by the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> may be sent to the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a controller (not shown) that controls the display to display the thumbnail images in accordance with at least one program stored therein, in order to help the user to select the image to be extra-printed. Thus, the user can determine the image to be extra-printed while looking up the thumbnail images on the display of the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When the user has determined the image to be extra-printed, the user can send the extra-printing request for that image via the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by specifying the corresponding thumbnail image. Alternatively, in a case of the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a display, the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may display the thumbnail images corresponding to the images kept by the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> to help the user to select the image to be extra-printed. Please note that the manner of determining the image to be extra-printed is not limited to the above examples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can produce a new recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> that stores images selected from a plurality of recording media <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Also in this case, the user can make the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> produce the new recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> only by sending the image IDs of the images to be extra-printed selected by the user from the plurality of recording media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a payment operation by the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> according to the embodiment of the present invention. The payment-mode receiving unit <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> receives the payment mode specified by the user. The payment processing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> performs the payment operation in accordance with the payment mode. As the payment mode, charging via a telephone company of the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a bank or a credit service company can be specified, for example. In a case of charging via the telephone company of the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the payment processing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> performs an operation for adding the cost to telephone fee of the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, the telephone company charges the user for the telephone fee including the cost for producing the recording medium. In a case of charging via the bank, the payment processing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> performs an operation for making the bank pay the cost directly from the user&apos;s account. In a case of charging via the credit service company, the payment processing unit <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> performs an operation for asking the credit service company for the cost required for producing the recording medium. The credit service company then asks the user for the cost. By the above-mentioned payment operation, the user can pay the cost without cash. Alternatively, if the user specifies the shop such as the convenience store, as the place to which the recording medium or the extra-printed photograph is to be delivered, the user may pay the producing cost in cash at the shop when the user receives the recording medium or the extra-printed photograph. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include a keeping-time monitoring unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and a keeping-time notifying unit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, if necessary. In this case, the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can keep the images in the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> only a limited term. The keeping term may be determined to be one month, for example. In a case where the keeping term is limited, the keeping-time monitoring unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> monitors keeping time for each image, that has passed after the image was recorded in the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, so as to determine whether or not the keeping time of the image reaches the end of a predetermined keeping term. When the keeping-time monitoring unit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> finds the image having the keeping time that has reached the end of the keeping term, the keeping-time notifying unit <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> notifies the user who is an owner of the image that the keeping time of the image reaches the end of the predetermined term, for example, by e-mail. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> If the user sends a predetermined instruction to the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in response to the notification within a predetermined waiting time period, the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may perform a predetermined operation in accordance with the user&apos;s instruction. For example, the user instructs the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to produce the recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> for the user, the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may produce the recording medium <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In a case where the user instructs the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to make a copy of a certain image, the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> makes the copy in accordance with the user&apos;s instruction. After the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has finished the predetermined operation or in a case where the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives no instruction from the user within the predetermined waiting time period, the image for which the keeping term has expired is deleted from the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Thus, it is possible to prevent the excessive increase the number of the images in the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The keeping term for each image has to be carefully determined considering disadvantages both to the user and the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. For example, if the keeping term is too short, the user is urged too much to determine how to deal with the image. On the other hand, if the keeping time is too long, the burden on the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> becomes too large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the image kept by the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> of the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be deleted by the user&apos;s instruction, even if the predetermined keeping term does not expire. Ina case where the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a display and allows the user to delete the image stored in the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the user may receive the kept images or the thumbnail images corresponding to the kept images from the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> so as to delete one of the kept images while browsing the received images presented on the display of the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Such a deleting operation can be realized by using a known function of the digital camera that deletes the image stored in the digital camera and transmitting the result of the deletion from the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with program that is stored in and executed by the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Similarly, in a case where the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a display, the user may receive the kept images or the thumbnail images corresponding the kept images by the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, so as to determine which image is to be deleted while browsing the images by means of the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The determination result is transmitted from the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> deletes the image kept by the image keeping apparatus <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> based on the determination result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> In the above description, an example in which the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are separate components is described. Alternatively, the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be formed integrally to be a single device. Also in this case, the same effects described above can be obtained. Moreover, it is not necessary that all the components of the delivery-medium producing apparatus be assembled together. For example, at least the converted image keeping-processing unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> for receiving the negative film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> from the user may be provided at a shop of development service or a convenience store to which the user brings the negative film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In this case, the user hands the negative film <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> to a shop clerk who operates the converted image keeping-processing unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the converted image keeping-processing unit <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be placed at a convenient place such as a station, as a stand-alone machine. In this case, the user can operate the converted image keeping-processing unit by oneself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The image transmitted to the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not limited to a still image. In a case of the digital camera <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that can capture a moving picture, the captured moving picture maybe transmitted to the delivery-medium recording apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the mobile phone <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, thereby the moving picture is kept by the delivery-medium producing apparatus <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In this case, it is preferable that the captured moving picture has a relatively short presentation time period. It is also preferable that the captured moving picture is transmitted after being compressed. The compression may be performed by an MPEG2 technique or an MPEG4 technique, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As described above, the user can obtain the recording medium storing the image the user captured without transferring the captured image from the camera to the personal computer or the like connected to the camera and writing the transferred image onto the recording medium by oneself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> As is apparent from the above description, according to the present invention, recording media can be produced for a plurality of users, each of which stores images for the corresponding user only, so as to be provided to the users. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described by way of exemplary embodiments, it should be understood that those skilled in the art might make many changes and substitutions without departing from the spirit and the scope of the present invention which is defined only by the appended claims. </paragraph>
