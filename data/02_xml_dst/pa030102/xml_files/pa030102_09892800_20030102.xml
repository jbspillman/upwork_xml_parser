<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of selling and purchasing and, in particular to methods of selling healthcare products via a preloaded, user-specific template on the Internet. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In recent years, the Internet has matured into a robust medium both for the dissemination of information and for the consummation of commercial transactions. Such commercial transactions have typically been characterized as &ldquo;C2C&rdquo;, &ldquo;B2C&rdquo; and &ldquo;B2B&rdquo; transactions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;C2C&rdquo; transactions are consumer-to-consumer transactions that are carried out via a central hub site operated by a third party, such as eBay, Yahoo Auctions, or the like, who generally to anonymously browse, but requires all customers to register in order to sell or buy products. These transactions are product specific rather than relational, with few buyers and sellers conducting other business in the future. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;B2C&rdquo; transactions are business-to-consumer transactions that are carried out at a web site controlled by the seller, such as Amazon, BestBuy, Travelocity, etc., who also will generally allow customers to anonymously browse, but requires all customers to register in order buy products. These transactions are not product specific, in the fact that a great number of products are available for purchase at a particular price that is set by the seller. However, there is often a relational aspect to B2C transactions, allowing sellers to target advertising or discounts to prior users. The price in B2C transactions is set by the seller and is often the same for all customers, although some sites have begun to set pricing for their products or services based upon user profiling, while others have utilized various types of auctions, reverse auctions or other specific pricing methodologies to set their prices. Once a product is ordered, the user will immediately pay for the product via credit card, virtual wallet, or other art recognized payment option, and the product will be shipped to its desired address. Subsequent orders will often not require any additional registration, but there will generally be no subsequent purchase of the same product by the buyer from the seller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The third type of transactions is &ldquo;B2B&rdquo;, or business-to-business, transactions. These transactions may take on the flavor of B2C transactions, such as when small businesses purchase from large suppliers, such as Staples, Office Depot, etc. However, even these types of transactions are highly relational, with repeat purchases of certain items being highly likely. This relational aspect provides the seller with an incentive to please the customer, and provides him with the information necessary to customize his order processing in order to best do so. However, despite the relational aspects of B2B transactions, and the advantages that it offers, this marketplace has largely adopted the B2C approach to the selling/purchasing function. This failure in approach has contributed to the tendency of business customers to continue to purchase through traditional channels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> B2C has been very successful and popular due to the fact that purchases are usually not part of a work environment, and the option is to go find the product in a store and drive to purchase it. This is much less convenient than ordering on line with regards to the ordering aspect itself. Further, the ability to order at any time of the day or night has added to the convenience. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> B2B on the other hand is quite the opposite in many ways and presents much different challenges than B2C. The business community either has a system of manually mailing, faxing or calling in purchase orders to the same suppliers on a regular basis. It is well known that the most efficient manner of ordering from these regular suppliers is total integration electronically through what is commonly known as EDI, which requires no manual interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, although many B2B marketplaces have promoted purchasing via their website, most businesses will not manually enter orders on a website purchase order due not only to their belief that it is faster to call or fax the order to the supplier, but also due to the inherent problems of inserting an improper part number and, more importantly, the lack of accurate pricing for the purchaser from the supplier on the website. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This fact appears to be true in all areas of business, but especially within the healthcare community where supplier sites may, at times, provide the ability to order, along with providing information about purchase histories and order status, but are infrequently used due to the potential for errors on ordering, the slowness of doing so and the difficulty of utilizing sales histories effectively. In these current systems, obtaining an up to date order status is probably the most successful reason to use supplier sites rather than traditional purchasing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Current B2B systems have a number of drawbacks. First, these systems do not typically provide customer specific pricing. In the B2B context, this pricing may be set by a specific quote, or by prior course of dealings between the parties. However, the price to be paid is generally known prior to the purchaser seeking to place an order and can be displayed and visually confirmed by the purchaser. Second, the B2C model has no need for the display of past quotes or purchases, or to associate a buyer identification numbers with a particular product, as users are unlikely to purchase the same item more than once. However, this is the &ldquo;bread and butter&rdquo; of B2B transactions. Third, payment for B2C transactions is typically made at the conclusion of the transaction, which is contrary to traditional business practices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Finally, many B2B systems fail to utilize the best features found in the B2C marketplace. These include the provision of customer specific product information, including peer reviews, &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; guides and the like, as well as the automatic electronic confirmation of orders and shipments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need for a method of selling, and a system computer program product for performing this method, that provides customer specific pricing, that displays past quotes and purchases, that allows a buyer to associate his own identification numbers with a particular product sold by the seller, that allows for payment &ldquo;on account&rdquo; under pre-agreed terms, that provides customer specific product information, including peer reviews, product protocols, &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; guides and the like, and that provides an automatic electronic confirmation of orders and shipments. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a method, computer program product and system for selling that makes Internet purchasing the most efficient, simplest, and fastest form of procurement for purchasers of products, such a healthcare equipment and supplies. The present invention provides a registered customer with the ability to simplify the purchase of products via a preloaded, user-specific order entry form on the Internet. The customer accesses a user-specific order entry form through a client system. The form reflects user-specific contract pricing and user-specific purchasing history. Products on the form consist of products ordered from the seller over a designated number of days. By simply entering the quantity for purchase next to the line item and processing the method of payment, such as via a purchase order, credit card, or the like, the user&apos;s purchase order is complete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the purchaser is a purchaser of healthcare products who uses a client system to enter quantities of these products in an HTML document supplied by the server system. This document is preferably supplied over the Internet in response to the identification of an IP address, password, cookie, or other authentication, of the customer accessing to the site. The HTML document supplied to the customer contains a user-specific order template entry form preloaded with information. This information preferably includes a listing of each product purchased from the seller in the past 30, 60, 90, 120 or more days, the user-specific price for each product, links to product photographs, clinical information, product availability, peer reviews, protocols, the product&apos;s content of certain compounds, such as latex or PVC (polyvinyl chloride), and UPN/barcode information, even though the product packaging may not contain all such information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Once the customer has entered information onto the entry form, the client and server systems subsequently exchange information entered by the purchaser, preferably on HTML screens supplied by the server system. These screens are a virtual &ldquo;shopping cart&rdquo; showing products added by the purchaser from the ordering template, order payment type and purchase order number, if such a number is supplied. The server system then processes this order information and preferably e-mails an order confirmation to the purchaser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, advanced search functions allow the customer to locate products and information by part number. This may be via product type, manufacturer, keyword, description, part numbers, or truncated versions of each. Additionally, some embodiments of the present invention provide a simplified &ldquo;view&rdquo; feature that provides a list of manufacturers, complete or sorted by specialty, and a list of product types, again complete or sorted by specialty, on the order template. Finally, all products are displayed on the site with user-specific pricing and a direct link to the order template </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, a computer program product performs the method of the present invention. This computer program product includes a storage means onto which is stored means for performing each step of the method. In other embodiments, the computer program product is integrated into a system for performing the method. This system includes a computer having a processor, a connection to an electronic network, and a memory that serves as the data storage means upon which the computer program product is stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is an aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system having part numbers of frequently ordered items pre-loaded onto an order form to reduce the risk of error by the insertion of incorrect part numbers and pricing on order forms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that displays specific and correct contracted pricing by product, not only on the order form, but in the display of every seller document that is associated with the part number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that only requires a login, quantity inserted for each line item desired and a customer instruction to place an order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that displays a link to a picture and information regarding the product next to the part number to aid the customer in confirming that the correct item is being purchased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that displays purchase history for a customer selected period of time in order to simplify the repurchase of previously purchased products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that allows a customer to order from the purchase history screen by inserting a quantity in a box next to the part number in the purchase history such that errors in repurchasing items is minimized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that provides a link to peer reviews on any product screen, including on the order form, such that customers can be reinforced on their purchasing decisions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that provides a link to available protocols on any product screen, including on the order form, such that customers can be sure of the proper protocol for utilizing the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that allows customers to insert their own internal part number, by line item, to choose the part numbers by which to view items throughout the system, and to allow customers to order or view products via their own internal part numbers rather than the seller&apos;s part numbers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that displays on the order template product quotes that were provided during a predetermined period such that customer can easily review and purchase a product that was quoted but not previously purchased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that provides a status on all orders received by any medium with daily updates such that customers can easily view the status of any order placed with the organization. It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that allows a customer to choose a physical location from which the order is being placed such that one user can make purchases for multiple locations without having to manage separate user information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that provides a link to &ldquo;Best Practices&rdquo; information, which provides suggestions on what products to purchase and what is considered the best in the industry </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that allows for convenient access to latex content, UPN/Bar Code, and PVC content such that those customers interested in this information can easily access it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that displays a simplified registration form for current customers such that current customers do not need to include information on their registration form that the seller already has. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that offers multiple payment options such that customers have a choice between using account methods or credit card methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It is a further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that allows customers to add &ldquo;New Products&rdquo; directly to the shopping cart such that the number of steps needed to make a purchase are decreased and such that the customer does not need to remember the new part number to add it to their order template or cart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> It is a still further aspect of the invention to provide a purchasing method and system that sends both an email confirmation of purchase and an email confirmation of shipping such that the customer can confirm the purchase and status of the order. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a registered customer the ability for simplified purchasing of healthcare products via user-specific order entry forms transmitted to the customer via the Internet. The user-specific order entry forms of the present invention reduce the number of user actions needed to place an order, decrease the likelihood of typical errors occurring in the process, and otherwise solve the above noted problems inherent in prior art systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the basic steps of the method of the present invention are illustrated. The first step in this process is for a user to log into the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. This step may involve the use of a password protected login screen, recognition of a cookie stored in the memory of the customer&apos;s computer, identification of a unique IP address, or other art recognized means for identifying a user over an electronic network. It is noted that the preferred embodiment of the system allows the customer to browse the seller&apos;s web page without first logging into the system, but will not display the customer specific pricing, or any other customer specific information, until the user has logged into the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Once the user has logged into the system, the system transmits a user-specific order entry form <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that includes at least one line item made up of a user-specific product identifier, a user-specific price for each product, and a quantity entry field for each product. As described in detail below, the order entry form may take many forms, but in all cases will include the user-specific price for each product and a quantity entry field in which a user may enter the desired quantity for the product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A user will then enter the desired quantities of desired products and will send this information to the seller, who receives the quantities <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and transmits a list of products selected by the user <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. This transmittal may be in the form of any art recognized &ldquo;shopping cart&rdquo; type display. If the list is correct, the user will send an instruction to proceed with the order, which is received <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> by the seller to complete the transaction. As described in detail below, this instruction may include a choice of a method of payment, specific location account, alternative shipping address, or other information necessary, or desirable, for processing the order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the method, a user is required to register over the Internet prior to a first login. In such embodiments, Internet registration causes the server system to assign the purchaser a unique identifier and to make available any previous purchaser-specific account, purchase history, order status, pricing and quoted information which may have been received prior to Internet registration by either phone, fax, email, mail, or EDI. This is preferably accomplished automatically via a mainframe computer, which prepares the appropriate data for the account numbers for which the customer has registered. This information is then transmitted to the Web server, which posts the data to the site. Once posted, the preferred system sends a notification to the registrant, via email, notifying them that their information has been posted to the site and is ready for viewing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in the preferred embodiment a customer logs onto the seller&apos;s Internet &ldquo;home page&rdquo; <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and is offered a number of choices for navigating through the site to complete the order process. At this home page <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, the customer is preferably given the choice of proceeding to a Buy, Browse, &amp; Shop page <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, a Purchase History page <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, or a Product Library page <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, which each correspond to a specific order entry form. If a user has not yet performed the login step <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, the user is offered the choice of performing the login step <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> or to proceed to a generic &ldquo;Buy, Browse, &amp; Shop page <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>, or Product Library <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> page. In some embodiments, the customer may choose products from these pages and add them to their virtual shopping cart in the same manner described in detail below. However, the prices displayed are not user specific prices, as no user is specified, and the customer may not actually order products without performing the login step <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> If a customer performs the login step <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, a customer specific Buy, Browse, &amp; Shop page <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, Purchase History page <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, or Product Library page <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is displayed. As described in detail below, these pages each provide access to order entry forms having the customer&apos;s user specific pricing, and from which quantities may be directly entered for purchase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> computer screen shot of the preferred user specific order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is shown. The order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is transmitted when a customer who has performed the login step and chosen the &ldquo;Buy, Browse, Shop&rdquo; option. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes columns in which are displayed an customer&apos;s internal part number <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, a package quantity <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, a quantity entry field <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> into which a user may enter a quantity of a product to be ordered, a customer specific price <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, a manufacturer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, a description of the product <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, a latex and PVC content indicator <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and a UPC/barcode indicator <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>. However, it is recognized that a variety of other information may also be included, and that some of the information shown may be eliminated, so long as the quantity entry field <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, customer specific price <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, and a description of the product <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The customer&apos;s internal part number <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, shown on the preferred order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, is based upon entry of the number <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> by the customer. The ability to allow the customer to enter this number <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, and to have this number displayed on all order entry forms throughout the system, makes it easier for the customer to insure that the part being ordered is the correct part and, therefore, expedites the order entry process. It also provides an additional check on the correctness of the order. As noted below, the customer&apos;s internal part number <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be entered in entry fields in a number of forms from which the customer may assign any alphanumeric character, or string of characters. In the event that the customer has not entered an internal part number <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the seller&apos;s part number may appear in its place (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). It is recognized, however, that other embodiments of the invention may not display customer internal part number <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, but rather will display only the seller&apos;s internal part number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The package quantity <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, manufacturer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, and description of the product <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are non user-specific information that is added to the order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as a further aid to the customer. Although the information itself is not user-specific, it is noted that the choice of the products <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> displayed is user specific. When displayed on the order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, this choice of products <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is based upon prior orders of products <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> within a selected time period, as well as those products <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> entered by the customer into the product entry field <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> displayed at the bottom of the order template <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The latex and PVC content indicator <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and UPC/barcode indicator <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> are both included in the preferred embodiment, as the preferred embodiment of the method relates to the purchase of healthcare products. However, it is understood that this information may be omitted, or replaced with other relevant indicators, in other embodiments of the invention. For example, if the present system were used to sell electrical products, indicators such as Factory Mutual certifications, silicone content, NEMA class compliance, or the like could be included in place of latex and UPC/barcode information. Further, it is also recognized that additional indicators, such as Environmentally Friendly Product (EFP) indicators, may also be added to the display of the indicators described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The price <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> displayed is a customer specific price <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> that is taken directly from a database accessed by the server. This database includes a reference to the customer and a list of all part number for which prices have been designated for, agreed upon by, or quoted to, that particular customer. As noted above, the price <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> displayed will normally differ from customer to customer. However, as in the case of new products that have not been quoted or previously purchased, the customer specific price may simply be list price, which will be used as the customer specific price until a new price is quoted or otherwise agreed upon. In all cases, the correct, customer specific, price <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> will be transmitted by the seller for display by the user whenever a price <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> for that product is transmitted by the seller. The customer specific price for each item is preferably updated daily via a synchronization of customer information between the mainframe computer and the Web server. However, in other embodiments, the information is entered directly into the database on the Web server and, therefore, customer specific prices are up the minute prices for the product. This ability to transmit the customer specific price <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> in this manner is a key feature of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The quantity entry field <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is a customer enterable field that allows the customer to order a desired quantity for each line item product <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. In the preferred order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, all product information is displayed in tabular form and this quantity entry field <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is displayed in on the same line as the other information regarding each product. However, in other embodiments, this quantity entry field <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be located at a different location upon the form. In all cases, however, the insertion of quantities into the quantity entry fields <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and the transmission of this information for receipt by the seller are the only actions required by the customer prior to instructing the seller to process the order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> In the preferred order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the transmission of the product quantity data is accomplished by the customer&apos;s choice of the &ldquo;Add to Shopping Cart&rdquo; icon <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> at the bottom of the order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments of the invention, this instruction is transmitted by simply adding a quantity into the field, by choosing another icon upon the form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, or by other art recognized means of choosing products for purchase over the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The preferred order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also includes a sort field <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> that allows a customer to sort and display the product information in a desired order. In the commercial embodiment employed by the assignee of the present invention, this sort field <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> displays a pop-up menu that allows the customer to sort the information by part number, manufacturer, product description and order frequency. However, it is understood that other sort criteria, or other art recognized means for sorting the product information, could be employed to achieve similar results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, the order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also includes an icon <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> that provides a link to change the information displayed upon the order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> from a display of previously purchased products to a display of products that were previously quoted but not yet purchased. This order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes all of the same information provided with regard to previously purchased products, including a customer specific price <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Once a previously quoted product <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is ordered, it will automatically be removed from the quoted product information and will appear on all subsequent order templates entry forms <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> displaying previously ordered products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Finally, the preferred order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> also includes icons <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> that provide to product information forms specific to each product <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. By choosing one of these icons <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, the customer transmits a signal to the seller, who receiving the signal that the link has been chosen and transmits a product information order entry form to back to the customer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The preferred embodiment of the product information entry form <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The product information order entry form <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be accessed via icons <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> in the order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, or may be directly accessed through the Product Library page <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, or through the Purchase Summary entry or Detailed Purchase History entry forms described below. The preferred product information order entry form <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes all of the product information displayed on the order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, such as the manufacturer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, product description <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, package quantity <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, customer specific price <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, quantity entry field <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, latex content indicator <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, and UPC/barcode indicator <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. In addition, a part number field <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, similar to the internal part number field <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, is included. This part number field <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> displays the seller&apos;s part number until a customer&apos;s internal part number is entered within the internal part number entry field <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> at the bottom of the form <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The preferred product information order entry form <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> also includes the stock status <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> of the product displayed. In the preferred embodiment, stock status <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is also provided during the daily update between the mainframe and Web server. In others, stock status <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is provided through a direct link to the sellers inventory control system and provides real time updates of stock status. In still others, the stock status <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is included in the product database and is updated manually when products are out of stock. It is recognized that the stock status <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> may also be provided along with the information on any other order entry form, or may be replaced with other similar information, such as estimated delivery time or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The product information order entry form <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> also includes additional product specific information not included in the order template entry form. For example, the preferred form <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes an image <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> of the product, which preferably may be enlarged to show a close-up view of the product, and a brief description of its key features <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. This image <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and description of key features provide an additional means for a customer to insure that they are ordering the correct product. The preferred form <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> also includes an icon <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> that provides a link to peer reviews of the selected product and an icon <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> that provides a link to available product protocols for the selected product. These links may also be accessed through the Product Library page <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and provide the customer with an additional level of security that they are ordering the correct part. In some embodiments of the invention, peer review and product protocol pages take the form of additional order entry forms, having the same features as those described elsewhere herein. In others, these pages are purely informational and do not provide the customer with the option of placing an order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, a Best Practices order entry form (not shown) may also be accessed via the Product Library page <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. The preferred Best Practices order entry form includes a list of the best products in a particular product type or category. For example, the seller might say that the Company X Rhesus bag is the best in the category for Rhesus bags. The user can then view the &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; template, from which they can place an order in the same manner as the user-specific template. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the user can also compare their purchase history order entry form to the best practice order entry form, and place an order in the same manner as previous templates by entering a quantity in either form. As was the case with all other order entry forms, the Best Practices order entry form also includes a customer specific price and a quantity entry field that allow the customer to place the order. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Finally, the preferred product information entry form <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a frame in which icons <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> provide links to all product categories. These links may also be accessed through the Product Library page <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and allow the customer to view information on products that have not been previously ordered or quoted. Once such a product is chosen, an updated product information entry form <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is displayed with the information relating to the chosen product and a customer specific price for that product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> As noted above, in addition to the customer specific Buy, Browse, &amp; Shop page <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and Product Library page <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, the customer may also elect to place an order through the Purchase History page <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, once a user logs into the Purchase History page <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, the customer is provided with the option of viewing an order status page <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, or entering a date range <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> from which the server will generate a purchase summary order entry form <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> or a purchase detail order entry form <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The preferred order status page <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> includes the purchase order number, the products on the order, shipping status of each product, a date of shipment, and a place of shipment. The preferred order status page <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> does not require that a date range <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> be provided by the customer, but rather is set at a desired number of months by the seller. However, it is understood that the order status page <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> could be preceded by an entry page for a date range <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and that the display of order status information on the order status page <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> could be customized by date. Likewise, the preferred order status page <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> is an informational page only and does not serve as an order entry form from which products may be reordered. However, it is also understood that the order status page <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> is readily adaptable for this function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the preferred purchase summary page <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes much of the same information shown in the order template entry form <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> described above, including the customer&apos;s internal part number <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, a package quantity <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, a quantity entry field <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> into which a user may enter a quantity of a product to be ordered, and an icon <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> to link to a product information entry page <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. However, the preferred summary page <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> omits the other information and replaces it with a quantity ordered <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> for a specified time period and a customer specific total price <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> for orders of that product during the specified time frame. In addition to the price and description information, the preferred purchase summary page <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> also includes the customer name and address <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight>, the date range <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> of the report, the same add to shopping cart icon <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> described above, and a new report icon <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> that allows a different report format to be generated. Finally, the summary page <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes a total of purchase <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> that were made during the specified date range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The preferred purchase detail order entry form <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. This form <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is similar in many respects to the purchase summary order entry form <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, except that some information is omitted and the order quantity <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> is broken down into monthly order quantity fields <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Regardless of which order entry form is used, once the customer has finished entering quantities of products, the seller will receive the quantities and transmit an Internet &ldquo;shopping cart&rdquo; to the user. The shopping cart may be any art recognized checkout means that displays products ordered, quantities thereof, and the price to be paid. In the preferred embodiment, the shopping cart screen allows customers to edit quantities or products to be ordered, or to add new products. In addition, the preferred shopping cart includes links to all other pages described herein, allowing the customer to resume shopping before checkout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Once the customer views to the shopping cart and reviews the information contained therein, the customer accepts the order and a signal is transmitted to the seller, who then may process the order. In the preferred embodiment, the processing of the order is confirmed automatically via an email message sent to the customer. However, in other embodiments, traditional order confirmation methods are utilized to achieve similar results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The methods described above are readily adapted for integration into a computer program product that may be purchase by sellers and loaded upon their computer systems. The development of a program product to perform the method of the present invention is a straightforward task that is well within the skill of those in the art. Accordingly, preferred program routines have not been described in detail herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments of the invention, the computer program product is integrated directly into a computer system and sold as a package to sellers. In such an embodiment, the system includes a computer having a processor, a connection to an electronic network, and a memory that serves as the data storage means upon which the computer program product is stored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred versions thereof, other versions would be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Therefore, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred versions contained herein. </paragraph>
