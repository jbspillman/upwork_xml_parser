<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Many children and adolescents experience hearing problems because of listening to music, watching television and movies, and playing with video games and toys that are very loud. Currently, some solutions to this problem are the use of headphones, and in particular, headphones having volume limitation mechanisms. Unfortunately, these solutions still require constant supervision. A volume limiter can also be a useful solution, but may become frustrating to use if the volume is set too low and the user cannot hear the audio, or ineffective if the volume is set too high. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is diagram illustrating an embodiment of the present invention. The embodiment shown by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes a headset <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with speaker earpieces <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, is equipped with a volume sensor/controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that receives an incoming audio signal from an audio source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, such as a stereo, television, radio, microphone, etc. The volume sensor/controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> compares the volume of the incoming signal to a predetermined threshold and adjusts the output volume accordingly. The volume sensor/controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will be described herein below in more specific detail with regards to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Also, attached to the headset <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a warning display <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, such as a series of LED&apos;s, an LCD, or other on-screen display (OSD) that light up or display a message to visually warn a person monitoring the headset user that the individual using the headset has the volume set at a level higher than the predetermined threshold. The warning display <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may also include an audible warning system, such as a buzzer or chiming device, to audibly warn a person monitoring the headset user that the individual using the headset has the volume set at a level higher than the predetermined threshold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The headset <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is connected to an audio source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> by a cable or wire <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and connects to the source by jack <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. It is also contemplated that the headset <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be connected to audio source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in a wireless manner, with a transceiver located in earpiece <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a transceiver located in audio source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a block diagram of the volume sensor/controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The volume sensor/controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a volume/frequency sensor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> for sensing the volume level of the input audio and represents the volume levels as energy functions from frequencies or as some average energy per frequency band, a comparator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> for comparing the audio input to a volume threshold, a volume calibrator <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> for setting the volume threshold and volume control mode, an active volume controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> for automatically reducing an output volume and a communication module <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> for communicating with a remote device and a PC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The first step in using the volume sensor/controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is to set the volume limits, or more specifically the volume threshold. This operation is done utilizing the volume calibrator <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The volume calibrator <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> contains different volume settings, and may be done incrementally or in preset steps. The volume calibrator <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> includes a category selector for selecting volume settings suited for different categories of users, and a category data base containing the different categories. Each volume setting has different volume characteristics suited for different users. Some examples of the different types of characteristics include a default category, where the volume is set to a standard level, and an age dependent category, where depending on the user&apos;s age the volume thresholds are determined. For example, a young child may have more sensitive hearing than an older adult. Therefore, the volume settings for a user age 3-5 will be much different than a user age 65 and over. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Another type of volume setting is by listener type. For example, listener type can be a volume setting that depends on a type or form of hearing loss or other hearing characteristic of the user. Hearing loss can be related to certain frequency bands. For example, some users have hearing loss at low frequencies and some at high frequencies. Each listener type regulates the volume in accordance with the specific type of hearing loss. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Further, there is a manual controlled setting that allows the user or persons monitoring or caring for the user to set their own volume thresholds. Once a volume threshold has been determined, the mode of the volume control is set to either &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; or &ldquo;manual&rdquo;. In the manual mode, the user or the person monitoring the user, must adjust the volume to be within the threshold limits. In the automatic mode, the output volume is controlled by the volume sensor/controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> automatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> During operation of the volume/sensor controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, an incoming audio signal is received by the volume/frequency sensor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The volume/frequency sensor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a pulse code modulator (PCM) <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, a fast fourier transformer (FFT) <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and a buffer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The volume/frequency sensor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> receives an incoming audio signal from an audio source <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the PCM <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> modulates it in order for the FFT <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> to represent the audio signal as energy functions of frequencies. The signal processing information is then stored in the buffer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The technique for such representation of signals is well described in scientific literature, and other methods of signal processing can also be used as an alternative. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Once the volume thresholds have been determined and the incoming audio signal has been processed by the volume/frequency sensor <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the comparator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> compares the processed incoming audio signal stored in the buffer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> with the volume threshold set in the volume calibrator <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. In the automatic mode, if the incoming audio signal is outside the threshold levels the comparator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> notifies the active volume controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the warning system <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, and the communication module <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The active volume controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> adjusts the level of the output audio signal accordingly. The warning system <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> receives the signal from the comparator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and activates the warning display <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> on the headset <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to notify the user or the person monitoring the user that the volume is too high. Preferably, in addition to the visual warning display <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the communication module <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes communication hardware for receiving the signal from the comparator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and sending a signal to a remote device, such as a hand held remote control, warning the monitor holding the remote device that the user has the volume set too loud. The indication may be a vibration, a visual indication, such as LED&apos;s, an audio signal, or a combination to alert the monitoring person. Also, in addition to sending a signal to a remote device, the communication module <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> sends a signal to a transceiver located at a PC to indicate to the person monitoring the user on the PC display that the user has the volume set too loud. In an alternate embodiment, this signal can be sent from a remote location via the Internet or other network. Further, the PC will then store the listener&apos;s listening history in a database stored within the PC. In the manual mode, the comparator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> does not notify the active volume controller <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, but does notify the warning system <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, and the communication module <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The volume control is to be performed manually, preferably, by using the remote device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a another embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, instead of being fixed to a headset <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the volume sensor/control <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and the warning display <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> are contained in a separate unit <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> allowing the system to work with a regular headset <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. The regular headset plugs into the output jack <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, and the audio source <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> plugs into the input jack <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight> of the unit <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. Unit <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> may connect to source <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> through jack <highlight><bold>411</bold></highlight>, or via a wireless connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates still another embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, a headset <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, similar to the headset <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> described herein above in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is equipped with a microphone <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. The microphone <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> acts as the audio source for the headset <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. The volume sensor/controller <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> and the warning display <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> function as described above. This embodiment of the invention is very useful in noisy situations such as concerts, motor races, and construction zones, in allowing some sound to reach the user under control of the volume sensor/controller <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flow chart illustrating the method of operation of an embodiment of the present invention. In step <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, a user or a person monitoring the user sets the volume thresholds and the volume control mode in the volume calibrator <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. Next, an incoming audio signal is received and then converted in step <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. The comparator <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> compares the converted signal with a predetermined threshold in step <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> to determine in step <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight> if the signal is greater than the threshold. If it is not, then the process returns to step <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> to receive another signal. If it is, in step <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> a warning signal is generated at the headset to notify the user or the person monitoring the user that the volume is set too high. In step <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether the volume control has been set to automatic or manual mode. If the volume control mode is set to automatic mode, in step <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether there is a remote device being used. If yes, in step <highlight><bold>616</bold></highlight>, a warning signal is sent to the remote device. If not, the process goes directly to step <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether a PC is being used. If yes, in step <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, a warning signal is sent to the PC. Also, in step <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> the user&apos;s listening history stored in a database within the PC is updated. If in step <highlight><bold>618</bold></highlight> it is determined that no PC is being used, the process skips steps <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, and goes to step <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> where the output volume is actively reduced accordingly, to be less than or equal to the volume threshold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> If in step <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight>, it is determined that the volume control mode has been set to the manual mode, in step <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight>, it is determined whether a remote device is being used. If yes, in step <highlight><bold>628</bold></highlight>, a warning signal is sent to the remote device and in step <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> the person with the remote device adjusts the volume accordingly. If in step <highlight><bold>626</bold></highlight> it is determined that no remote device is being used, then the process goes directly to step <highlight><bold>632</bold></highlight> to determine if a PC is being used. If a PC is being used, in step <highlight><bold>634</bold></highlight> a warning signal is sent to the PC and in step <highlight><bold>636</bold></highlight> the user&apos;s listening history is stored in the database. If no PC is being used, the volume is reduced and the process returns to step <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> to perform the operation with a newly received audio signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
