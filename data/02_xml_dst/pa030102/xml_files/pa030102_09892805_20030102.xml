<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This disclosure relates to semiconductor fabrication, and more particularly, to a system and method for aligning lithographic patterns by employing acoustic energy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor devices are processed in levels. Materials are formed in layers and patterned, typically using lithographic processes. To build devices and components on semiconductor devices, layers of materials are employed. These layers must be properly aligned so that patterns and components on different layers line up and function correctly once fabricated. Lithographic alignment on prior levels is critical to ensure proper overlay. Lithographic alignment typically includes providing a bullet and target arrangement where the bullet is an alignment mark to be aligned against a target alignment mark. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> These alignment marks may include features with sharp edges, for example, trenches or plateaus formed on a layer of the semiconductor device. A photomask includes alignment features corresponding to the features (e.g., alignment marks) formed in a previous level of the semiconductor device. The features of the photomask are aligned to the features of the semiconductor device to ensure proper overlay. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Alignment of these marks is typically performed by an optical system. Either bright field or dark field broad band illumination is used to detect the prior level alignment marks (e.g., the alignment marks formed on the device). Broad band illumination is employed to make a plurality of wavelengths of light available to detect the prior level alignment marks. Light is incident on a surface and is reflected back in different areas based on the thickness of different features. For example, if light is directed normal to a surface having a plateau formed thereon, light would be reflected from a top surface of the plateau and from surfaces adjacent to the base of the plateau. The reflected light from both surfaces includes the same wavelengths, but are out of phase by the thickness of the plateau. This causes an interference condition, either constructive or destructive depending on the thickness and the wavelength of light employed. Since a broad band spectrum is employed many wavelengths are available to perform this measurement and improve contrast of the feature or alignment mark, in this case, a plateau. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Although broad band illumination is used to enhance the contrast of the alignment marks, there are still instances, where the properties of the stack on the alignment marks and of the surrounding area have very low contrast. For example, small thickness variations can cause the complete loss of contrast. For dark field illumination, the angle of light incidence or detection can lead to image misplacement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a need exists for a system and method for improving the contrast of alignment features to provide greater accuracy in deciphering the alignment features. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Systems and methods for deciphering an alignment feature are disclosed. A feature is provided on a semiconductor wafer having an elasticity that is different from material surrounding the feature. A stress is applied to the wafer, the feature is scanned with an atomic force microscope to determine a position of the feature.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides new systems and methods for deciphering alignment mark positions. The present invention employs alignment marks formed from a different material than the substrate or layer in which the mark is formed. By focusing an acoustic beam or by other methods of applying acoustic energy to the substrate of layer, an atomic force microscope (AFM) is employed to detect edges of the alignment marks. The present invention significantly increases alignment mark detection accuracy over prior art light illumination/interference techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring now in specific detail to the drawings in which like reference numerals identify similar or identical elements throughout the several views, and initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an alignment mark pattern <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in accordance with the present invention. Alignment marks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may include plateaus or trenches, respectively. Marks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> include a target pattern while marks on a mask or tool (not shown) may include a bullet pattern to be aligned against the target pattern. In accordance with the present invention marks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed from a material, which has a different acoustic response from the layer or substrate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> marks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed on (or formed in). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a substrate of a semiconductor wafer. Marks <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed by etching trenches in substrate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and filling trenches with a material <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, which has a different acoustic response from substrate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Alternately, marks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are formed by depositing the material on layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and patterning the materials to form marks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Marks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may include any material, which has at least one distinguishable acoustic property as compared to layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In one example, the materials of marks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> have a different elasticity (for example, modulus of elasticity, E) as compared to layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The material of marks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may include a resist material (e.g., organic resists), polysilicon, amorphous silicon, silicate glasses (e.g., BPSG), SOG, SiN, ARC or any other suitable materials, which have a different elastic constant and thus have a different acoustic response from, e.g., a Si substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> cross-sectional view of a semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown. Acoustic energy <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is applied a surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from an acoustic energy source <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, such as, for example, an ultrasonic oscillator. Acoustic energy source <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may include a customized ultrasound gun or any standard acoustic source adapted to focus acoustic energy on wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Acoustic energy <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> causes vibrations to propagate through wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and alignment mark <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, causing stress/strain in the materials thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> An atomic force microscope (AFM) <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is employed to detect the differences in the stress/strain fields created by the acoustic energy <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. AFM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes a tip <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which is moved over wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and alignment mark <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to determine with atomic scale resolution where the interface between alignment mark <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> occurs. By introducing alignment mark <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> processing, where the mark <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> material has a different elastic constant than the surrounding substrate or layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, special resolution can be achieved in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, a focused acoustic beam <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is placed just above the wafer surface, with an ultra fine AFM tip <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in close proximity, then an image of alignment mark <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed. The focused acoustic beam operating at ultrasonic frequencies will penetrate into the wafer surface and the AFM tip can be used to detect the response of surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Because ultrasound propagates as a function of the material, the change in elastic properties between mark <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will result in a detectable difference at AFM tip <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The focused acoustic beam <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a resolution equivalent to the wavelength of the acoustic waves propagated. This may be of order of about 1 micron. However, if tip <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes an AFM cantilever tip <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> as a transmitter of acoustical oscillations as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, then the resolution is merely limited to the AFM tip radius, currently between about 10 and about 20 nm. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, cantilever tip <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> transfers acoustic energy to surface <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by vibrating. The vibrations are propagated through tip by acoustic transmitter or oscillator <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> of AFM <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Alignment systems currently use optical methods for resolving alignment marks with much poorer actual resolution than an AFM. However, the current systems use complex signal analysis and multiple mark arrays to achieve greater resolution and mark positioning accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> By employing similar methods of an array of &lsquo;stress&rsquo; marks plus signal analysis and edge detection, the Acoustic-AFM approach can achieve even greater accuracy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> flow chart is shown for an alignment mark detection and alignment method in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention. In block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a semiconductor wafer is provided with alignment marks formed on or in a substrate or layer of the wafer. The alignment marks include a material with different acoustic response properties than the wafer or layer on which the alignment marks are formed. In a preferred embodiment, the alignment marks include a material with different elastic properties as compared to the areas surrounding the alignment marks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In an alternate embodiment, any feature or structure may be employed as an alignment mark. For example, functional components of the semiconductor devices to be formed may be employed as alignment marks. Since an AFM is preferably employed, any feature on a chip may be used to align a next layer or mask. By using pattern recognition software, any existing, unique, array/support feature may be employed as the AFM Ultra-fine alignment mark. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the area of the alignment mark is located. This may be performed by employing coarse optical alignment methods of the prior art. For example, an optical microscope or a pattern recognition algorithm may be employed to locate the alignment marks of the wafer. AFM scanning may also be employed to find the alignment marks. However, optical pre-alignment saves time over AFM scanning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Current wafer alignment techniques employ optical pre-alignment with optical fine alignment. Optical methods may be employed to put the AFM system in close proximity to the acoustic alignment mark, hence reducing the amount of AFM scan time required and maximizing throughout. Current fine alignment optical marks are about 150 microns in size. An acoustic mark could be made {fraction (1/10)}<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>or even {fraction (1/100)}<highlight><superscript>th </superscript></highlight>the size and be placed anywhere in the chip. This would have the added benefit of reducing the necessary optical Kerf size and increase die/wafer productivity by reducing the alignment mark area thus increasing layout efficiency reserving more substrate areas for active devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Since the alignment marks are to include a material with different elastic properties as compared to the wafer, any feature may be employed for the alignment mark. By using pattern recognition software, the alignment mark of feature is identified among the many other features and components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, energy is provided to cause stress fields in the area of the alignment marks. The energy may include ultrasonic energy. The energy is preferably focused on the wafer surface in the area of the alignment mark. Alternately, a vibrating cantilevered AFM tip may be employed to provide vibrational energy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, when the stress field is applied, an AFM tip is employed to scan across a surface of the wafer. As the AFM tip is scanned elastic properties are measured and the boundaries of the alignment marks are determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, the results from block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> are employed to align a subsequent exposure mask, etch mask or other tool to the wafer. Alignment algorithms or tools known in the art may be employed to perform the alignment. However, in accordance with the present invention, atomic scale alignment resolution is provided. For example, the alignment resolution may be about 10 to about 20 nm or better depending on the tip radius of the AFM tip. Also, thin film interference effects of optical systems are eliminated for fine alignment. For example, contrast problems, poor images and other optical effects are no longer at issue in the alignment process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, an illustrative system for alignment mark detection and alignment of masks/tools with respect to a semiconductor wafer is shown in accordance with the present invention. A semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is provided on a stage <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Stage <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> provides rotation and translation of wafer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to align wafer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to pattern or mask <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. An optical system <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> is included to provide coarse alignment (e.g., pre-alignment) of an AFM tip <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> of an AFM <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. An acoustic source <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be provided or an oscillator or acoustic transmitter <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may be employed with tip <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> preferably if tip <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is a cantilevered tip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Optical system <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> includes an illumination source <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, preferably a broadband illumination source, which irradiates wafer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> with light. Optical system <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> includes a light sensor <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, which receives light from illumination source <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> to perform measurements for coarse alignment/AFM tip placement. Sensor <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be included in a peripheral device, such as a camera, for example, a CCD camera, which provides visual images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> One or more processors <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may be employed to control stage <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, microscope <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and optical system <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Coarse alignment may be performed by pattern recognition software <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> stored in memory <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and optical system <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Images taken by optical system <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> are pattern recognized to determine the areas where alignment marks or features are located or AFM scanning may be employed for coarse and fine alignment. Coarse alignment may also be performed by known optical techniques. Memory <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> may include a program storage device readable by machine, tangibly embodying a program of instructions executable by the machine to perform method steps for deciphering the features or marks of a wafer and aligning a mask or tool to the wafer in accordance with electrical signals generated by the AFM. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Wafer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is scanned by AFM tip <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> in the presence of a stress field, preferably provided by acoustic energy or a vibrating AFM tip. Tip <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> is moved relative to stage <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> until alignment marks or features are deciphered on wafer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Signal data from AFM scanning is processed and or recorded in memory <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> to record the location of alignment marks. Signal data is processed and analyzed by known algorithms in processor <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. After an identification of alignment marks (either by optical or acoustic methods), a lithographic tool such as a scanner or stepper, will align a mask to a wafer to be &ldquo;exposed&rdquo; in the lithographic process. Mask <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and alignment marks are then aligned, and lithographic exposure etc. is performed as is known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Having described preferred embodiments for ultra-fine alignment system and method using acoustic-AFM interaction (which are intended to be illustrative and not limiting), it is noted that modifications and variations can be made by persons skilled in the art in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that changes may be made in the particular embodiments of the invention disclosed which are within the scope and spirit of the invention as outlined by the appended claims. Having thus described the invention with the details and particularity required by the patent laws, what is claimed and desired protected by Letters Patent is set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>
