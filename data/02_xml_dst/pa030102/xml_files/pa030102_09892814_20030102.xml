<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">The invention relates to a heart shaped novelty device. This heart shaped novelty device contains a microprocessor, a memory, a timer, at least one switch, a noise maker and an oscilloscope display. The timer is set on a random time, wherein when the timer runs down, the microprocessor signals the noise maker to make a noise while the oscilloscope display changes its display from a heart beat display to a pure flat line. At this point a user can pick the heart shaped novelty device up and squeeze its sides to trigger the switch. Once the switch has been triggered, the noise maker will stop making noise and the oscilloscope display will change back to a heart beat display. In another embodiment of the invention, the heart shaped novelty device also contains an electronic drum beat that beats back and forth to simulate a heart beating. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to an electronic toy that signals an alarm when the toy has not been held for a period of time. More particularly, the invention relates to a heart-shaped toy that emits a sound, light and a beating sensation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. The Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Heart shaped novelty toys are known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,124,022 to Gross discloses a heart novelty and relaxation device. There is a heart-shaped housing that contains a speaker and circuitry for producing a slow heart beat sound which has a relaxing effect on a listener. In this case, the housing is assembled from two molded plastic conformal sides having integral complementary brackets that mate to hold the sides together along a median plane. There is a circuitry mounted on a board which also supports an on/off switch having a flat arm that pivots in the median plane. This flat arm projects unobtrusively from the housing through the slide of the interface between the sides to facilitate extra control of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,131 to Sirota discloses a toy heart that is an expanding and contracting heart produced by a separate generator or in response to sensing a pulse beat of a child by a sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,836,823 to Laven discloses a heart-shaped novelty item. In this case, there is a novelty item having a heart-shaped housing with a translucent window formed therein. The housing has two conductors formed on the exterior thereof. When the housing is held in a person&apos;s hand, there is a conductive path formed between the two conductors and one or more LED&apos;s in the interior of the housing begins to flash on and off to show the beating heart. In this case, there are shown side sensors or a back sensor wherein when the heart is held in the person&apos;s hand, it shows that the heart starts beating again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 5,816,885 to Goldman et al discloses a deformable sound-generating electronic toy. In this case, the deformable toy can play back prerecorded or newly recorded sounds, music, messages which have predetermined playback rate as recorded to the device. There is disposed within the toy a piezoelectric transducer and a plunger engaging the body and the transducer responds to pressure transmitted through the medium by deforming of the body to shift the plunger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,718,876 to Lee discloses a child calming toy with rhythmic stimulation. In this case, there is disclosed a stuffed animal having a pocket which contains a heart beat stimulating transducer. The power of the simulator heart beats may be regulated by an adjustment of a potentiometer via a knob. As shown there is a support pin which overlies a switch which is wired to actuate an electronic pulsing circuit powered by a battery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,508,520 to Sellers et al discloses a light-emitting novelty device having a heart-shaped convex-concave, light-transmitting cover. Disposed within the heart is a miniature light bulb which is screwed into a socket of a light holder. There is also a switch which is connected to the circuit board to turn on the light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention differs from the prior art because the present invention contains a display showing an oscillating heart beat, a series of levers that can be used as sensors to revive a heart, and a timer to cause the heart to stop beating. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> refers to a front view of the heart shaped novelty device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Here there is shown a cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which is made from a cloth material. Disposed on cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are two eyes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which are designed to give novelty device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> a more life-like view. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In addition, disposed on cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a mouth <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. With this design, the heart shaped novelty device takes on the features of a human face so that children or other users can identify with heart shaped novelty device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, there is also disposed on device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> a chain <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that is designed to connect to a top region of device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to allow a user to carry device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on chain <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In addition device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also contains an oscilloscope display <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a speaker <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> disposed inside of mouth <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and at least one lever connected to a switch located in regions <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is shown a cross section of device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> wherein there is shown cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which covers padding <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and flexible housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Padding <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> combines with cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to give a user a soft feel for novelty device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In addition, housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is made from a semi-rigid but flexible material. In a preferred embodiment this material is made from a flexible plastic such as poly ethylene or polypropylene. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a side view of device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> wherein there is shown a view of region <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which contains a side lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Side lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is disposed within housing <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and remains beneath padding <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. With this design, when a user presses on cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in region <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, lever <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> presses in and activates switch <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. There is also an optional port (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) that opens out on cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> wherein this optional port allows device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to connect to an adjacent personal computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a schematic block diagram <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. This block diagram shows speaker <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, oscilloscope display <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a power supply such as a battery <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a series of clips <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a timer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a processor/memory unit <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> an oscillating mechanism <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and an optional port <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> all electronically coupled together. Battery <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> provides power for the remaining components so that a user can read a heart beat on oscilloscope display <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and can hear the beating of the heart, a flat line sound or a series of statements out of speaker <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In addition, to simulate a heart beat, oscillating mechanism <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is disposed inside of cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> wherein oscillating mechanism <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is designed to create an oscillating beat or physical beat to simulate a heart beat. Timer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> works along with processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> so that this device periodically fails to continue beating wherein each time the timer stops the heart from beating, processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> sends a signal to speaker <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, to sound an alarm from the heart. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Once the alarm has sounded, the user has a preset period of time such as one minute to revive the device before timer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> shuts device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> down. At this same time, oscillating mechanism <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is designed to stop moving. If the user reaches device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> before it has shut down, the user can then press on clips <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to reset timer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and keep device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> turned on. Processor <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can also contain an additional memory <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> which can be used to allow device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be programmed. Device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be programmed so that it expires either randomly or after a preset period of time. In addition device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be programmed so that it requires a certain number of hits or contacts on clips <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to revive device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Another way to revive the device would be to connect ports <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to an external PC such as a particular heart reviving device. This PC or heart reviving device would revive the device until the next time timer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> stops the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, shows a vibrating or oscillating mechanism <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can also be included. This oscillating mechanism <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is designed to beat along with oscilloscope display <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to simulate a heart beating. Oscillating mechanism <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be in the form of a rotating electrical motor <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> that turns a lever or propeller <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>. During one portion of the rotation, lever <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> rotates into a region near axis <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and may press out against cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, while during a second portion of the rotation, lever <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> rotates in a region near axis <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so that lever <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is extended lengthwise along device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> so as to no longer press out against cover <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This alternating pressing out and rotating inward of lever <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> thus simulates a heart beating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, while one embodiment of the present invention have been shown and described, it is to be understood that many changes and modifications may be made thereunto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. </paragraph>
