<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to systems for transferring electronic information. More specifically, the present invention concerns a system for transferring a file of electronic information so as to protect the interests of a holder of a copyright in the transferred file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Most artwork, books and music are protected by copyrights. Copyrights are legal rights intended to protect the interests of a copyright holder by allowing a copyright holder to control copying of his copyrighted material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Controlling copying is essential to protecting the interests of a copyright holder. For example, unauthorized copying decreases the value of copyrighted material to a copyright holder, because every sale of an unauthorized copy is a lost sale to the copyright holder. Also, the existence of unauthorized copies may decrease the rarity and therefore the value of copyrighted material. Moreover, a copyright holder may wish to control copying to ensure that his copyrighted material is not used in an undesirable manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the past, the interests of a copyright holder were somewhat protected by difficulties in creating satisfactory copies of copyrighted material. For example, music or movies experienced a significant loss in quality when copied onto analog tape media. Also, copying bound books required the manually-intensive process of copying and collating each page using a photocopier. In view of these difficulties, consumers usually opted to purchase an authorized copy of copyrighted material rather than to create an unauthorized copy. As a result, unauthorized copies did not significantly affect the market for most copyrighted material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> For example, the Book-of-the-Month Club&reg;, in existence since 1926, periodically sends bound books to subscribers. Unwanted books are returned by the subscribers. Due to the manually-intensive process needed to copy bound books, most subscribers will pay for a desired book instead of copying and returning a desired book. As a result, the Club has continued to remain profitable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Advances in the use and reproduction of analog and digital files have addressed many of the previous hurdles to unauthorized copying. For example, music and books may be embodied in electronic files and perceived therefrom using electronic devices. These electronic files may be easily copied with modern computing systems such that the copies have little or no perceptible difference in quality from the originals. As a result, the interests of copyright holders have become seriously undermined. Such factors have discouraged electronic versions of the Book-of-the-Month Club&reg;. Specifically, it is believed that electronic copies of music or books delivered to a subscriber are likely to be copied and returned. Accordingly, an electronic version of the Book-of-the-Month Club&reg; might not generate acceptable profits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In view of these problems, what is needed is an improved system to control copying of material embodied in electronic files. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In order to address the foregoing needs, the present invention provides a system to transfer electronic information. According to one embodiment, a command to transmit a portion of a file of electronic information is received, and, in response to the received command, the portion of the file of electronic information is automatically copied to create a copied file of electronic information, the copied file is transmitted, and the portion of the file of electronic information is rendered unusable. By rendering the portion of the file of electronic information unusable after copying the file, no additional usable copies of the portion of the file will remain. As a result, a degree of protection is provided to any copyright interest in the electronic information embodied therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In certain embodiments of the foregoing aspect, it is determined whether the portion of the file of electronic information should be rendered unusable based on an electronic tag associated with the portion of the file. Such a feature allows certain files to be identified as to be rendered useless if copied, which may be particularly advantageous for files embodying copyrighted material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In another aspect, the present invention concerns a system to provide a file of electronic information in which a file of electronic information is provided, a copy of a portion of the file of electronic information is received, and a certificate certifying that the portion of the file of electronic information has been rendered unusable is received. The foregoing system may be used to allow a consumer to return electronic files to a distributor, while assuring that the electronic files have been rendered unusable. Again, such an arrangement protects the interests of a holder of a copyright in the returned files. Such an arrangement also enables an electronic book or music subscription service in which an unwanted file containing text, audio, or images may be returned or destroyed by a subscriber in such a way that the service can be assured that unauthorized copies have not been made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> With these and other advantages and features that will become hereafter apparent, a more complete understanding of the nature of the invention can be obtained by referring to the following detailed description and to the drawings appended hereto. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a flow diagram of process steps <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to provide a file of electronic information according to embodiments of the present invention. In order to provide an immediate introduction to features of the present invention, process steps <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will now be described without reference to a particular embodiment. Of course, a complete description of specific hardware and software embodiments of the claimed invention is set forth below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Initially, in step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, a file of electronic information is provided. The file may be formatted in any now or later-perceivable format, including .wav, .mp3, .gif, .pdf, .bmp, etc. The file may embody copyrighted information, such as music or a novel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the file is provided in step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to a consumer based on a subscription. That is, the consumer to whom the file is provided has entered into an agreement with an entity to receive certain information periodically in exchange for payment. In this regard, the file provided in step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> represents the information to be received by the consumer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A copy of the file of electronic information is received in step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Returning to the subscription embodiment, the copy may be received from the consumer to whom the original file was provided in step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> if the consumer decides not to keep and pay for the original file. Next, in step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a certificate is received certifying that the original file of electronic information has been rendered unusable. In some embodiments, the certificate is also received from the consumer who received the original file. In such a case, and as described in detail below, it is contemplated that the consumer upon copying the original file may generate the received certificate. Such a system assists in determining that the consumer has not kept a usable copy of the file, and therefore protects the interests of a holder of a copyright in any information embodied in the file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Network Architecture </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a topographic view of a network architecture according to embodiments of the present invention. Of course, network architectures other that that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may be used to implement the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows communication network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in communication with subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, copyright server <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and consumer devices <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. As such, communication network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may comprise any number of systems for transferring data, including a local area network, a wide area network, a telephone network, a cellular network, a fiber-optic network, a satellite network, an infra-red network, a radio frequency network, and any other type of network which may be used to transmit information between devices. Additionally, communication network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be used to transmit data using any known transmission protocol, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Internet Protocol (IP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Wireless Application Protocol (WAP). In one embodiment, communication network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is the World Wide Web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may comprise a network server or other device capable of performing the functions described herein. Subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may control various operations of an entity providing subscription services, such as consumer tracking, inventory tracking, accounting, sales tracking and the like. It should be noted that subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may also control distribution of electronic files to consumers on a non-subscription basis. According to one embodiment, subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> operates to provide a file of electronic information, to receive a copy of the file of electronic information, and to receive a certificate certifying that the file of electronic information has been rendered unusable. Details of one embodiment of subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are set forth below with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Copyright server <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may also comprise a network server or other computing device. Copyright server <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may monitor the sale, transmission and use of copyrighted information over communication network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, copyright server <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> receives a certificate from a consumer device certifying that a file of electronic information has been rendered unusable after the file is copied and the copied file is transmitted from the consumer device to subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Consumer devices <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> comprise an electronic book, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) and a workstation, respectively. Consumer devices <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> operate in accordance with one embodiment to receive a command to transmit a file of electronic information, and, in response to the command, to automatically copy the file of electronic information so as to create a copied file of electronic information, to transmit the copied file, and to render the file of electronic information unusable. In this regard, a consumer device according to the invention may be any device or devices capable of receiving, processing and transmitting files of electronic information. Consumer devices <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> may also be used by a consumer to perceive received files of electronic information. For example, consumer device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may be used to view files formatted in an electronic book format, and consumer device <highlight><bold>401</bold></highlight> may be used to listen to audio files. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, the elements of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are connected differently than as shown. For example, some or all of the elements may be connected directly to one another. Of course, embodiments of the invention may include elements that are different from those shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the devices shown in communication with each other need not be constantly exchanging data. Rather, communication may be established when necessary and severed at other times or always available but rarely used to transmit data. Moreover, although the illustrated communication links between the components of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> appear dedicated, it should be noted that each of the links may be shared by other components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Subscription Server </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a block diagram of the internal architecture of subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment of the invention. As illustrated, subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> in communication with communication bus <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be a Pentium&trade;, RISC&trade;-based, or other type of processor and is used to execute processor-executable process steps so as to control the components of subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to provide functionality according to embodiments of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Also in communication with communication bus <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is communication port <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Communication port <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is used to transmit data to and to receive data from devices external to subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Communication port <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is therefore preferably configured with hardware suitable to physically interface with desired external devices and/or network connections. In one embodiment, files of electronic information are transmitted to and received from consumer devices over communication port <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Input device <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, display <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and printer <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> are also in communication with communication bus <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Any known input device may be used as input device <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, including a keyboard, mouse, touch pad, voice-recognition system, or any combination of these devices. Input device <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may be used by an entity to input file information, consumer information, subscription information, and other information to subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Of course, such information may also be input to subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> via communication port <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Commands for controlling operation of subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may also be input using input device <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, such as commands to transmit a file, to receive a file, or to output a listing of returned files. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Such a listing may be output to display <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, which may be an integral or separate CRT display, flat-panel display or the like. Display <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> is generally used to output graphics and text to an operator in response to commands issued by microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Printer <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may also output graphics and text, but in hardcopy form using ink-jet, thermal, dot-matrix, laser, or other printing technologies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> RAM <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is connected to communication bus <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to provide microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> with fast data storage and retrieval. In this regard, processor-executable process steps being executed by microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are typically stored temporarily in RAM <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and executed therefrom by microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. ROM <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, in contrast, provides storage from which data can be retrieved but to which data cannot be stored. Accordingly, ROM <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is used to store invariant process steps and other data, such as basic input/output instructions and data used during system boot-up or to control communication port <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that one or both of RAM <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and ROM <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> may communicate directly with microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> instead of over communication bus <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Data storage device <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> stores, among other data, subscription server program <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> of processor-executable process steps. Microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> executes process steps of subscription program <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> in order to control subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to provide a file of electronic information in accordance with the present invention. More specifically, the process steps of subscription program <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> may be executed by microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> to provide a file of electronic information, to receive a copy of the file of electronic information, and to receive a certificate certifying that the file of electronic information has been rendered unusable. As a result, distribution of the electronic information can be controlled to some degree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The process steps of subscription program <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> may be read from a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk, a CD-ROM, a DVD-ROM, a Zip&trade; disk, a magnetic tape, or a signal encoding the process steps, and then stored in data storage device <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> in a compressed, uncompiled and/or encrypted format.

These elements are known to those skilled in the art, and are therefore not described in detail herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Consumer Device </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates several components of consumer device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment of the invention. The components may comprise any of the specific examples set forth above with respect to identically-named components of subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Of course, specific functions performed by the components may differ from the functions performed by the identically-named components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> For example, communication port <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> may be used to receive files of electronic information, to transmit copies of such files, and to transmit certificates certifying that a copied file has been rendered unusable. Input device <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> may be used by a consumer to input commands to return a received file of electronic information or to operate an application for perceiving the electronic information. In this regard, electronic information comprising a book may be perceived by displaying pages of the book on display <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, or by printing the pages using printer <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>. In a case that the electronic information represents music, the information may be perceived by operating an application for playing the music through speakers (not shown). Input device <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>, display <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> and printer <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> may also be used in conjunction with other applications provided by consumer device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> which are unrelated to the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Data storage device <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> stores consumer subscription program <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> of processor-executable process steps. The process steps of consumer subscription program <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> may be executed by microprocessor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> so as to control consumer device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to receive a command to transmit a file of electronic information and, in response to the command, to automatically copy the file of electronic information to create a copied file of electronic information, to transmit the copied file, and to render the file of electronic information unusable. The process steps of consumer subscription program <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> may be read from a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk, a CD-ROM, a DVD-ROM, a Zip&trade; disk, a magnetic tape, or a signal encoding the process steps, and then stored in data storage device <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> in a compressed, uncompiled and/or encrypted format. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with, processor-executable process steps for implementation of the processes of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Also stored in data storage device <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> are processor-executable steps of Web browser <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight>. The process steps of Web browser <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight> may be executed by microprocessor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> to allow consumer device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to send and receive files over the Web. More specifically, Web browser <highlight><bold>494</bold></highlight> allows consumer device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> to transmit information to and to receive information from a device executing process steps of a Web server, such as subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Electronic information files <highlight><bold>496</bold></highlight> are also stored in data storage device <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight>. As described above, some or all of electronic information files <highlight><bold>496</bold></highlight> may be received from subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in accordance with a subscription or otherwise. As also described, electronic information files <highlight><bold>496</bold></highlight> may include files of copyrighted information of which an associated copyright holder would like to prevent copying. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Data storage device <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> may also store application files, data files and system files other than those shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. These files may be used to provide a consumer with functionality other than that provided by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Subscription Database </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A tabular representation of a portion of subscription database <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The information stored in subscription database <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> may be entered by an employee through input device <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, or may be received from a consumer device over communication network <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As previously mentioned, the information stored in subscription database <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> may be used to determine what electronic files to provide to a consumer, to determine how to provide the files in accordance with a subscription, and to track returned files. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Subscription database <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> includes several records and associated fields. The fields include consumer ID field <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, delivery information field <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, subscription type field <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, returned field <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, and certificate received field <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight>. Consumer ID field <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight> of a record specifies a consumer who is a party to a subscription agreement with the entity operating subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The subscription agreement may be entered into by any known manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Delivery information field <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> of a record provides information usable to deliver files of electronic information to an associated consumer. As shown, delivery information field <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> may include an IP address, an e-mail address, a telephone number, and a postal address. Of course, delivery information other than that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> may be used in accordance with the present invention, and some consumers may be associated with more than one entry in delivery information field <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Subscription type field <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> specifies a particular type of files to which an associated consumer subscribes. For example, subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may offer several types of subscriptions from which a consumer may choose according to the consumer&apos;s tastes. Accordingly, subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> provides files of electronic information to the consumer corresponding to the chosen subscription type. Since the files provided in accordance with this example are not specifically selected by the consumer, the consumer may occasionally decide to return a file which he does not want to purchase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Returned files are tracked using returned field <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. This field identifies those files that have been returned by an associated consumer. In one embodiment, the returned files are copies of original files provided to the consumer by subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. As described with respect to process steps <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a returned copy of a file may be accompanied by a certificate certifying that the original file has been rendered unusable. Such a certificate is intended to ensure that a single original file is not converted to two or more usable files. Certificate received field <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> is used to indicate for which returned files a certificate has been received. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> It is contemplated that subscription database <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> may include many more records than those shown and that each record may include associated fields other than those illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. In this regard, database <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> may include fields identifying copyright holders associated with particular files of electronic information, files which embody copyrighted information, or other information. Moreover, database <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> may include records representing subscriptions offered by more than one entity, and non-subscription-based transactions such as a traditional sale. It should also be noted that the tabular illustration and accompanying description of subscription database <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> merely represents relationships between stored information. A number of other arrangements may be employed besides those suggested. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> File Structure </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a representative view of electronic information file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> according to one embodiment of the present invention. Electronic information file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> may be transmitted by subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to consumer device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> and stored in data storage device <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> along with electronic information files <highlight><bold>496</bold></highlight>. Electronic information file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> may be stored in subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> prior to the transmission or in a data repository or other device in communication with subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> As shown, electronic information file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> includes several data segments. Segment <highlight><bold>601</bold></highlight> comprises a title or album name, chapter titles or song titles, and/or other bibliographic information identifying electronic information file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. Segment <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> includes an electronic tag specifying a copyright holder in information embodied by file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> as well as any copying restrictions imposed by the copyright holder. Of course, several copyright holders may be specified in segment <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, a consumer issues a command to transmit file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> back to subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and, in response, process steps of consumer subscription program <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> are executed by microprocessor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> to determine, based on segment <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, that file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> should automatically be copied and rendered unusable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Segment <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> specifies a certifying authority deemed by the copyright holder to be a trusted authority. Again, more than one certifying authority may be specified in segment <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the specified certifying authority is associated with a device such as certification server <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Certifying authority information may be used in several ways in accordance with the present invention. For example, consumer subscription program <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> may include different process steps to automatically copy and render a file unusable that are approved by different certifying authorities. Accordingly, upon receiving a command to transmit file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> back to subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, those process steps that have been approved by a certifying authority specified in segment <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> are identified and executed. In another example, a device associated with the specified certifying authority, such as certification server <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, may be contacted by consumer device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> after the command is received and may transmit the appropriate process steps to consumer device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. In addition to or alternatively to either of the above examples, the associated device may be contacted after copying and rendering file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> unusable to obtain a certificate certifying that file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> has been copied and rendered unusable. The certificate may then be transmitted to the copyright holder specified in segment <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, to subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and/or to another entity to indicate that no additional usable copies of file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> have been created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Electronic information <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> of file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> may include copyrighted or non-copyrighted information such as images, text, audio, software, or other information. The information may be in any form perceivable using known or hereafter known systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Specific Example </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Process steps <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</cross-reference> set forth a process to obtain consumer information according to an embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, process steps <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> will be described as being partly included in subscription program <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> and executed by microprocessor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and partly included in consumer subscription program <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> and executed by microprocessor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of consumer device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Of course, it should be noted that process steps <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> may be performed by any device or by any number of devices in combination. Moreover, some or all of process steps <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> may be performed manually. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Process steps <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> begin at step S<highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight>, in which a file of electronic information is provided to a consumer. The file may include any electronic information, including an image, text, multimedia, a movie, audio, music, software, news, weather, sports news, and data. As described above, a file may be provided to a consumer in step S<highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> in accordance with a sale of the file, an unsolicited offer to sell the file, or a subscription. In one example, a consumer is identified in subscription database <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> along with an associated subscription type and delivery information. Accordingly, using the delivery information, the consumer is provided with a file in step S<highlight><bold>701</bold></highlight> corresponding to the subscription type. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Next, in step S<highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, the file is received by consumer device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The file may be received via communication port <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> or via a medium delivered to the consumer and read using a compatible device included with consumer device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. A command to transmit the file is received in step S<highlight><bold>703</bold></highlight>. The command may be input by the consumer using input device <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> and may comprise a command to transmit the file back to subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that the command may also comprise a command to transmit the file to another entity or device, such as a consumer device operated by another consumer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> After the command is received, it is determined in step S<highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> whether the file should be automatically copied and rendered unusable. In one embodiment of step S<highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, microprocessor <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> executes process steps of consumer subscription program <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight> to determine whether the file includes an electronic tag, such as that included in segment <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> of file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, indicating that the file should be automatically copied and rendered unusable. If the determination in step S<highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> is negative, the file is copied and the copy is transmitted in step S<highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> If the determination in step S<highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> is affirmative, flow proceeds to step S<highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> to automatically copy the file and to render the original file unusable. The file may be copied using any known system for copying a file of electronic information. For example, the file may be copied in either one of steps S<highlight><bold>705</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> by creating an electronic mail message including the file, or by copying the file to electronic storage, magnetic storage, or optical storage. Similarly, the file may be rendered unusable using any known system, such as by erasing the file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Next, in step S<highlight><bold>707</bold></highlight>, a certificate is obtained certifying that the original file has been rendered unusable. In one embodiment, the certificate is produced using process steps of consumer subscription program <highlight><bold>492</bold></highlight>. These process steps may be pre-approved by a certifying authority. Additionally, the approving certifying authority may be specified by the file as illustrated by segment <highlight><bold>603</bold></highlight> of file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, the process steps produce a code after step S<highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> and transmit the code to the certifying authority through certification server <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Certification server <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> then verifies that the code indicates that the original file has been rendered unusable and transmits a certificate to that effect to consumer device <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The copy of the file and the certificate are transmitted in step S<highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>. In the present example, the copy and the certificate are transmitted to subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the copy and the certificate are reflected in returned field <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and certificate received field <highlight><bold>505</bold></highlight> of subscription database <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, one or both of the copy and the certificate are also or alternatively transmitted to certification server <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> or to a holder of a copyright in information embodied in the file. In this regard, the file itself may specify the copyright holder as shown in segment <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight> of file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> receives the copy of the file in step S<highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight>, and receives the certificate in step S<highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>. Again, in other embodiments of steps S<highlight><bold>709</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, one or both of the copy and the certificate are also or alternatively received by certification server <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> or by a holder of a copyright in information embodied in the file. Next, in step S<highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>, the certificate is provided to a holder of a copyright in information embodied in the file. The certificate is provided by subscription server <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the present example, but may be provided by any other entity storing the certificate. Of course, there is no need to perform step S<highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight> if the certificate was provided to the copyright holder in step S<highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As previously mentioned, the foregoing steps provide a degree of protection to any copyright interest embodied in a file of electronic information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with respect to particular embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will note that various substitutions may be made to those embodiments described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
