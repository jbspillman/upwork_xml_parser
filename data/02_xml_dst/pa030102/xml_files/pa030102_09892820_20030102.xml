<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for controlling blood volume and hydration, and for indicating resuscitation status of a patient using peripheral venous pressure as a hemodynamic parameter. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Patients undergoing major surgery are at risk for significant blood loss and hemodynamic changes while under anesthesia. A portion of that risk is associated with the surgery itself, and the remainder is attributable of the effects of anesthetics, mechanical ventilation, positional changes on cardiac function, relative blood volume, and vascular tone. Oxygen carrying capacity as well as the body&apos;s efficiency in removing carbon dioxide and metabolic wastes are a function of blood volume. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For patients having procedures with a likelihood of significant blood loss, or for patients in whom hemodynamic changes are especially threatening because of coincident cardiovascular disease, central venous pressure (&ldquo;CVP&rdquo;) monitoring has been widely used. CVP is a direct measure of blood pressure, not blood volume. In a normal range of hemodynamic values, CVP appears to have more utility as a trend monitor than for titration to an absolute end point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The measurement of CVP requires the insertion and maintenance of a catheter in the thorax. Typically, the catheter is positioned in the superior vena cava from an insertion site in an external or internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, or, less often, from a femoral or antecubital vein. CVP placement adds time and monetary costs to surgery. Also, CVP measurements typically include respiratory variations and cardiac excursions that must be considered during monitoring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The need to control blood volume and hydration and assess resuscitation status are particularly important in neurosurgical patients undergoing either craniotomy or complex spine surgery. It is also important to control hydration in hospitalized patients as well as nursing home patients. </paragraph>
</section>

A controllable infusion pump pumps fluid from the fluid source to a peripheral vein of the patient through the fluid conduit. An occluder blocks fluid communication through the fluid conduit between the fluid source and the patient. A fluid pressure sensor senses fluid pressure in the fluid conduit. The apparatus further includes a controller for determining a peripheral venous pressure value from the sensed fluid pressure in the fluid conduit after the infusion pump is stopped and the occluder blocks the fluid communication through the fluid conduit between the fluid source and the patient. The peripheral venous pressure is indicative of fluid volume of the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for controlling fluid volume in a patient comprises a fluid source and a controllable infusion pump connected to the fluid source through a fluid inlet line. The apparatus includes a catheter inserted in a peripheral vein of a patient and connected from an outlet of the infusion pump through a fluid outlet line so as to provide a fluid communication path between the peripheral vein of the patient and the pump. Activation of the pump results in fluid being delivered to the patient from the fluid source through the catheter. An in-line pressure sensor is positioned substantially at a heart level of the patient for sensing pressure in the fluid communication path and providing a pressure measurement signal indicative thereof. The apparatus further includes an actuatable in-line occluder for isolating the fluid source from the patient when the occluder is actuated and control means for periodically stopping the infusion pump, actuating the occluder, monitoring the pressure measurement signal, and determining a peripheral venous pressure value of the patient in response thereto. Means are provided for adjusting operation of the infusion pump in response to the determined peripheral venous pressure value. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to control the ratio of blood volume to total vascular compliance in a patient and in particular, the ratio of the stressed blood volume to vascular compliance. The stressed blood volume is the amount of blood volume above the unstressed or priming blood volume. The unstressed blood volume is that amount of blood necessary to begin to stretch the vessel walls of the cardiovascular system so that pressure begins to rise above zero. Below this unstressed blood volume value, the heart pumps empty and is no longer able to generate a cardiac output or maintain an elevated arterial blood pressure. Once blood volume rises above the unstressed volume of the cardiovascular system, the venous pressure begins to rise as a function of the compliance curve of the blood vessels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The ratio of stressed blood volume to vascular compliance is the mean systemic pressure (&ldquo;P<highlight><subscript>ms</subscript></highlight>&rdquo;). P<highlight><subscript>ms </subscript></highlight>is the effective upstream pressure that drives venous return and, ultimately, cardiac output. It has been discovered by applicants that P<highlight><subscript>ms </subscript></highlight>is also the pressure that the cardiovascular system converges to during circulatory arrest and is useful in estimating a patient&apos;s blood volume, hydration, and resuscitation status. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> It has been discovered by applicants that peripheral venous pressure (&ldquo;PVP&rdquo;) is indicative of P<highlight><subscript>ms</subscript></highlight>. In effect, applicants have discovered that PVP is indicative of the patient&apos;s mean systemic pressure, the pressure to which all vascular beds converge in the absence of cardiac function. PVP is indicative of the ratio of blood volume to vascular compliance and is, therefore, a useful hemodynamic parameter for measuring blood volume and hydration, and for indicating resuscitation status. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of description herein, pressure is measured in and described in terms of millimeters mercury (&ldquo;mmHg&rdquo;). Flow rates are measured in and described in terms of cc/hr. Applicants have discovered that, although there is a pressure differential between CVP and PVP (PVP being greater than CVP), correlation between CVP and PVP is substantially linear over a wide range of pressure. PVP reflects an upstream venous variable and is coupled to CVP by a continuous column of blood. The differential between the two is variable from patient to patient. However, in an individual patient, the difference between PVP and CVP is substantially constant. In studies conducted by the applicants, the correlation between PVP and CVP is approximately 0.997. CVP measurements, however, include respiratory variations and cardiac excursions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, in accordance with the present invention, controls blood volume and hydration and indicates resuscitation status in a patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is supported in a supine position on a support surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such as an operating table during surgery or a bed during convalescence. The patient could be in a lateral or prone position. Although the present invention is described for a surgical patient, the invention is applicable to trauma patients as well as hospitalized and nursing home patients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A gravity feed intravenous fluid source <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> such as blood, saline solution, or other desired fluids and medications in an IV bag <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of known volume is supported on a stand <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and positioned well above a heart level <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the supined patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The fluid source <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with an infusion pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through a transparent drip chamber <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and fluid inlet line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a disposable cassette <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The disposable cassette <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is, in turn, in fluid communication with the patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through an outlet fluid line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a catheter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The catheter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, such as an angiocatheter or any other intravascular catheter, is inserted into a peripheral vein of the patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> such as in the patient&apos;s arm <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Inlet line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, cassette <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and outlet line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> form a fluid conduit between the fluid source <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The infusion pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a data input source <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that permits the inputting of data to the infusion pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for control of the pump. The infusion pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> further includes manual control switches <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> for manually controlling the pump&apos;s operation. A data display <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is provided for displaying data such as peripheral venous pressure of the patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, total fluid volume infused into the patient, fluid remaining in the present IV <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, fluid flow rate, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the disposable cassette <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes a substantially flat frame portion <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> made of vinyl plastic material having mounting holes <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> arranged to be snapped into or positioned on mounting pins in the infusion pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> typically through a door (not shown) arrangement known in the art. The cassette <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes a flexible inlet passage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> connected to the fluid inlet line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> using a coupling <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight>. The inlet passage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with a pressure sensing chamber <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the cassette <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> having flexible side walls that expand and contract in response to fluid pressure within the chamber <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. Fluid pressure sensing chamber <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with a fluid pumping chamber <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of cassette <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through a flexible fluid passage <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The walls of the pumping chamber <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are flexible and can be expanded or contracted via mechanical means to draw fluid into the cassette <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and pump fluid from the cassette. The pumping chamber <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with the fluid outlet line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> via a flexible passage <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The coupling <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> connects passage <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> with the outlet line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> When the cassette <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is operatively positioned within the infusion pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with the infusion pump door (not shown) closed, the fluid pressure sensing chamber <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is in communication with a pressure sensing transducer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The pressure sensing transducer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> senses the fluid pressure within the chamber <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and provides an electrical signal <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> to a controller <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> indicative of the pressure within the chamber <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The pressure transducer signal <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is indicative of fluid pressure in mmHg. The transducer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is used for PVP measurement and has a sensing range of 0-30 mmHg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The pumping chamber <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is in operative communication with a pump <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> which takes the form, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, of an electrically actuatable reciprocating member. The cassette <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can include a magnetic disk <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> secured to one of the flexible side walls of a pumping chamber <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. The reciprocating member of the pump <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is magnetically secured to the disk <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. Fluid is drawn into the chamber <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> when the reciprocating member or arm of the pump <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> retracts so as to expand the chamber <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Fluid is pumped out of the chamber <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> when the reciprocating member or arm of the pump <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> extends and applies pressure to the pumping chamber <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> so as to compress the chamber. Since the volume of the pumping chamber <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and the stroke of the reciprocating member or arm of the pump <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are known, a known volume of fluid is pumped each time the reciprocating member retracts and extends. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The infusion pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> further includes a plurality of actuatable valve members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> used for occluding and permitting fluid flow in passageways of the cassette <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Operation of these valves in combination with pumping strokes of pump <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> allow fluid to be pumped from the fluid source <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Valves <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are retractable valve members operatively connected to valve actuators <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and individually actuatable to occlude or permit fluid flow through its associated fluid passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The valve member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is operatively coupled to the flexible passage line <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> so as to permit fluid flow through the passage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> or to occlude fluid flow through the passage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. Valve member <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to passage <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to permit or occlude fluid flow through the passage <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Valve member <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to flexible passage <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to permit or occlude fluid flow through the passage <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A flow clip <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to a flow clip actuator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The flow clip <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is an elongated V-shaped occluding device that can be slid in one direction to occlude fluid flow through the cassette <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and in another position to permit fluid flow through the cassette <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. During pump operation, the clip is positioned to allow fluid flow through the cassette <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The infusion pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is positioned on an adjustable support stand (not shown) so that the height of the longitudinal axis of the cassette <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is substantially at the patient&apos;s heart level <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. This positions the pressure sensing chamber <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and pressure sensing transducer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at the patient&apos;s heart level. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The controller <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to the valve actuators <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, to the flow clip actuator <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and to pump <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> for the control and operation of fluid flow through the cassette <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, i.e., control of fluid pumping from the fluid source <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is also connected to the pressure transducer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, to the data input source <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and to manual control switches <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and is responsive thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> When it is desired to pump fluid from the source <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, valve <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is actuated to occlude fluid communication to the patient while valves <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are open. The actuator arm of the pump <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> then retracts to fill the chamber <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> with fluid. Once the chamber <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is filled with fluid, at least valve <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is closed and valve <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is opened. The pump <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> extends its actuator arm to compress the chamber <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and pump fluid downstream toward and into the patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. During this compression of the chamber <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, valve <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> could also be closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> When it is desired to monitor the peripheral venous pressure of the patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the pump <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is stopped and valve <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> actuated to occlude fluid communication between the fluid source <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Valves <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are opened thereby forming a fluid column between the pressure sensing chamber <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the venous system of the patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A predetermined time period, such as 15 seconds, is allowed to lapse or is timed out by controller <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. This time period is necessary to attenuate or remove the effects of pump actuation itself on any pressure measurements. After this time period lapses, the controller <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> monitors the output signal <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the pressure transducer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. This pressure transducer signal is indicative of the peripheral venous pressure of the patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is also indicative of the mean systemic pressure of the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The infusion pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be controlled open loop or closed loop. During surgery, it is contemplated that an open loop control would be used by the anesthesiologist to permit him maximum control of flow rate to control PVP. In nursing home or hospitalized settings or where large amounts of blood loss are not occurring, it is contemplated that a closed loop control would be preferred requiring less continuous monitoring by the health care providers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an open loop control process, in accordance with the present invention, for controlling blood volume and hydration and for indicating resuscitation status of the patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is shown. In step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the infusion pump electronics are reset by clearing certain internal memories, setting initial flag conditions, etc. In step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, an intravenous fluid source is connected to the patient through the infusion pump/cassette and catheter inserted into a peripheral vein. In step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the position of the pump and a pressure sensing transducer are adjusted so that the pump and the pressure sensing transducer device are located substantially at the heart level of the patient. The fluid source is occluded from the patient and an initial PVP measurement is made. The fluid source being occluded from the patient is accomplished by actuating valve <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. This occlusion is necessary to remove the pressure resulting from the fluid source per se from PVP measurements. The initial readings from the pressure transducer are hydrostatically zeroed in step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> so that pressure measurements within the fluid line or conduit connected to the patient will indicate only venous pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, fluid communication between the fluid source and the pressure measuring transducer is occluded (i.e., valve <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is actuated to close off passage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>) and PVP is monitored in step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. To determine an initial patient PVP value, several measurements or samples of the signal <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> from pressure transducer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be made over time and an average value determined based upon a predetermined number of measurements. The patient&apos;s PVP value (as referred to herein, an averaged value) is then displayed in step <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, the clinician sets a target PVP value using the data input source <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the infusion pump based upon the initial value display in step <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. The set target value is preferably a target range. The infusion pump flow rate is set in step <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> at a value designed to maintain or achieve the set PVP target value in step <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. This flow rate can be entered through the data input source <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Three pump flow rates are preferably used in this control process. If the patient PVP pressure is within a range of its target value, a maintenance pump flow rate can be 70 cc/hr which is a value selected to hold or maintain the present PVP pressure within its present range assuming there is no substantial fluid loss. If it is decided that the patient&apos;s PVP rate needs to be increased, the pump flow rate selected to increase PVP can be 500 cc/hr. If it is determined that the patient&apos;s PVP value is greater than a target range and needs to be lowered, the pump flow rate selected to lower PVP can be 15 cc/hr. This low flow rate is known as the &ldquo;keep-open&rdquo; rate selected to keep the patient&apos;s vein/catheter interface open. The three different flow rates can be entered in through the data input source <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and defined as the low, medium, and high flow rates. Flow rates other than these three can be used as well as additional flow rates can also be used in the control process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the fluid communication between the fluid source and the pump is unoccluded and the pump is actuated. In the pumping operation, the pump being in an unoccluded condition means that valves <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are periodically opened and closed in response to the operation of the pump <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> so as to pump fluid from the fluid source <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to the patient <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, the latest patient PVP measurement is displayed, the present fluid flow rate is displayed, and the total volume of fluid pumped to the patient is displayed. Also, the amount of remaining fluid in the fluid source can also be displayed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, a determination is made as to whether a predetermined period of time has passed. This predetermined time is that time set by the clinician through the data input source <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and is the amount of time desired between PVP measurements. If the determination in step <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is negative, the process returns to step <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> where the flow rate, total volume of fluid pumped to the patient, and volume of fluid remaining in the fluid reservoir are updated and displayed. When the determination in step <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is affirmative, the pump is stopped in step <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and the fluid source is occluded from the patient fluid line or conduit, i.e., valve <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is actuated to block or shut-off passage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the fluid pressure within the fluid pressure chamber <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is monitored after a predetermined settling time has lapsed since pump shut-off, such as 15 sec. This time period permits settling of the venous system so as to remove effects of the pump <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> from pressure measurements. The new PVP measurement (newly determined average value) is then displayed on the display <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> for the clinician. A determination is then made in step <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> by the clinician as to whether the newly determined PVP value is within the range of the target value set in step <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. This range could be plus or minus 3 mmHg of a discrete set target value. Alternatively, the controller of the infusion pump can make this determination and then increase, decrease, or maintain pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> If the determination in step <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> is affirmative, the process returns to step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> where the fluid source and pump are unoccluded (meaning that valve <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is again permitted to open and close). The pump is again actuated and valves <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are periodically actuated and deactuated in synchronous with the pump <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> so as to pump fluid at a maintenance level. If the determination in step <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> is negative, a new pump flow rate is set in step <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> to either increase or decrease blood volume or hydration as required. If step <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> determines the PVP is less than the target range, fluid flow needs to be increased. If step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> determines the PVP is greater than the target range, fluid flow needs to be decreased. After the new flow rate is set in step <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, the pump is again actuated in step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and valves <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are actuated in such a manner as to pump fluid at a rate to either increase or decrease the blood volume or hydration of the patient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> At any time during the open loop control shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the clinician has the opportunity to adjust the operation of the pump, e.g., flow rate, using the manual control switches <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The manual control switches allows the clinician to effectively override preset flow rates by increasing or decreasing the pump flow rate, force a new PVP value determination, or other desired control based upon his judgment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, a closed loop control process, in accordance with the present invention, for controlling blood volume and hydration and for indicating resuscitation status of a patient is depicted. This closed loop control is particularly useful in hospitalized or nursing home patients. In step <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the infusion pump electronics are reset by clearing certain internal memories, setting initial flag conditions, etc. In step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, an intravenous fluid source is connected to the patient through an infusion pump and catheter inserted in a peripheral vein. In step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, the position of the pump and the pressure sensing transducer are adjusted so that the pump and the transducer measuring device are located substantially at the heart level of the patient. The fluid source is occluded from the patient and an initial PVP measurement is made. The fluid source being occluded from the patient is accomplished by actuating valve <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. This occlusion is necessary to remove the pressure from the fluid source per se from the PVP measurement. The initial pressure readings from the pressure transducer are hydrostatically zeroed in step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> so that pressure measurements within the fluid line or conduit connected to the patient will indicate only venous pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, fluid communication between the fluid source and the pressure measuring transducer is occluded (i.e., valve <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is actuated to close-off passage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>) and a PVP measurement is monitored in step <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. To determine an initial patient PVP value, several measurements or samples of the signal <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> from pressure transducer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be made over time and an average value determined based upon a predetermined number of measurements. The patient&apos;s PVP value (as referred to herein, an averaged value) is then displayed in step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, the clinician sets a target PVP value using the data input source of the infusion pump based upon the initial value displayed in step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. The set target value is preferably a target range. The infusion pump flow rate is set in step <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> at a value designed to maintain or achieve the set PVP target value in step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Three pump flow rates are preferably used in this control process. If the patient PVP pressure is within a range of its target value, a maintenance pump flow rate can be 70 cc/hr which is a value selected to hold or maintain the present PVP pressure assuming there was no substantial fluid loss. If it is decided that the patient&apos;s PVP rate needs to be increased, the pump flow rate selected to increase PVP can be 500 cc/hr. If it is determined that the patient&apos;s PVP value is greater than a target value range and needs to be lowered, the pump flow rate selected to lower PVP can be 15 cc/hr. This low flow rate is the &ldquo;keep-open&rdquo; rate selected to keep the patient&apos;s vein/catheter interface open. The three different flow rates can be entered in through the data input source <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and defined as the low, medium, and high flow rates. Flow rates other than these three can be used as well as additional flow rates can also be used in the control process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, all of the manual inputs of manual control switches <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are monitored. In step <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, a fluid volume subroutine is performed. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, this subroutine is depicted. In step <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, a determination is made as to the remaining fluid volume remaining in the fluid source <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> such as IV <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This volume is known since the initial volume of the source is known from a default value or from a value entered in through input source <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. A determination is made in step <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> as to whether or not there is a sufficient fluid volume available to continue (available to initiate the first time through the subroutine) operation of the infusion pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. If the determination is negative, the pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is stopped or prevented from operation in step <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> and an alarm is activated in step <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>. If the determination in step <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> is affirmative, the process returns in step <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> to the main control process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring back again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, the infusion pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is actuated or maintained at its maintenance flow rate in step <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>. As described with regard to the open loop control arrangement, three pump levels may be used. A 70 cc/hr flow rate can be set to be a normal maintenance flow rate to maintain the patient&apos;s PVP level at its present state. A determination is made in step <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> as to whether a preset time period has expired. This time period is a time period entered through the data input <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and is the time period between which PVP measurements are to be made. If the determination in step <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is negative, meaning that the time period has not lapsed, the process returns to step <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> and the pump continues to pump. If the time period has expired, i.e., an affirmative determination in step <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, the pump is stopped and the fluid source <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is occluded from the pump for the purpose of making a new PVP measurement (average value) in step <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> (i.e., valve <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is actuated). A predetermined time period such as 15 sec. is allowed to lapse in step <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> to permit settling time within the fluid communication line and venous system of the patient so that a PVP measurement can be made. A PVP measurement or determination (based on an average of a plurality of samples) is made in step <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> after the time period in step <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>. The new PVP measurement or determination (based on the averaged value) is displayed on the display <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A determination is then made in step <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> as to whether or not the PVP measured in step <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight> is within the target value range such as plus or minus 3 mmHg from a particular value. If the determination is affirmative in step <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>, the process returns to step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. As part of the fluid value subroutine in step <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, it should be appreciated that the flow rate and the time between PVP measurements is considered in the determination as to whether there is sufficient fluid remaining in the source. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> If the determination in step <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> is negative, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> where a determination is made as to whether or not the PVP of the patient needs to be increased. If the determination in step <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> is affirmative, an indication of the need to increase PVP can be displayed and the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>368</bold></highlight> where the manual input control switches <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are again monitored to determine if a clinician desires an operational change. The fluid volume subroutine is performed again in step <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> to ensure that a sufficient fluid volume remains in the fluid source if pumped at a higher flow rate for the time period that will be allowed to lapse before a new PVP determination is made. Assuming a sufficient fluid volume does remain, the infusion pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> unoccludes the fluid source (valves <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are periodically opened and closed) and the pump is driven at a higher flow rate so as to pump at preferably 500 cc/hr in step <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>. A determination is then made in step <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> as to whether a preset time period has expired. This time period is initially set through the data input source <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and may be the same as or different as the preset time period in step <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>. This time period is a time period desired between PVP measurements or determinations when the pump is driven at its higher flow rate. This time period is considered in the fluid volume subroutine <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight>. If the determination in step <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> is negative, the process returns to step <highlight><bold>374</bold></highlight>. Once the determination in step <highlight><bold>376</bold></highlight> is affirmative, the process returns to step <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> where the process for determining a new PVP value is made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> If the determination in step <highlight><bold>366</bold></highlight> was negative, meaning that the patient&apos;s PVP needs to be decreased, the process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> where the manual control switches <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are monitored to determine if the clinician desires a change in operation. The process proceeds to step <highlight><bold>382</bold></highlight> where the fluid volume subroutine is performed taking into account the lower minimum pumping rate that will be used to decrease the patient&apos;s PVP and the time period that will be allowed to lapse between PVP measurements or determinations at the lower pump rate. Assuming a sufficient fluid volume supply remains taking into account the lower fluid flow rate and the time between PVP measurements, the fluid source is unoccluded (valves <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are periodically actuated) and the pump driven at the minimum flow rate in step <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>. This lower fluid flow rate designed to lower the patient&apos;s PVP may be, for example, 15 cc/hr. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> A determination is then made in step <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> as to whether a preset time period has expired. The preset time period used in step <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> is preset using the data input source <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This time period may be the same as that used in step <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> or may be different. This time period reflects the amount of time desired between determinations of PVP when the pump is driven at a lower flow rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> If the determination in step <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> is negative, the process returns to step <highlight><bold>386</bold></highlight>. If the determination in step <highlight><bold>388</bold></highlight> is affirmative, the process returns to step <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> where the process to monitor the next PVP value is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> After the pump is driven at either a higher rate to increase PVP or a lower rate to lower PVP, the program determines if the PVP has come back within the target range in step <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight>. Once the PVP has come back within range, the process returns to step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and pump flow rate is returned to the maintenance value in step <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The infusion pump <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> could include an additional pressure sensor (not shown) operatively connected to the fluid conduit that monitors for a pressure indicative of a continuous line occlusion during pumping resulting in a high pressure in the fluid conduit. This line occlusion sensor would be a higher pressure rated transducer than the PVP transducer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The line occlusion sensor would be connected to the controller <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. If the controller determines a continuous line occlusion exists during pumping, the pump would be stopped and an alarm sounded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The present invention permits control of blood volume and hydration, and indicating resuscitation status by measuring PVP at a peripheral catheter/vein site. The present invention permits the delivery of fluid through a catheter while measuring PVP in the same fluid line or conduit. The PVP value determined in accordance with the present invention is indicative of the patient&apos;s mean systemic pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> From the above description of the invention, those skilled in the art will perceive improvements, changes and modifications. For example, flow rates can be different from those described. Also, a different type of infusion pump and in-line pressure sensing arrangement can be used. Preferably, the pressure sensor is in sensing communication with the fluid conduit at heart level and pressure measurements are made with the fluid source occluded and a predetermined time after the pump is shut-off. The PVP can be measured apart from the pump and the determined PVP value used to control the infusion pump. Such improvements, changes and modifications within the skill of the art are intended to be covered by the appended claims. </paragraph>
