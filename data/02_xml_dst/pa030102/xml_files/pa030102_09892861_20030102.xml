<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Electric toothbrushes utilize an electric motor to drive a brush head to provide a brushing action for cleaning teeth. One such toothbrush is disclosed by Sham in U.S. Pat. No. 5,822,821. Sham discloses an electric toothbrush having a motor, which drives a driven gear. The driven gear drives a crank member. The crank member, in turn drives a reciprocating rocker arm. The rocker arm, in turn, drives a brush head. The rate of rotation of the driven gear in the device determines the frequency of reciprocation of the brush head, while the length and shape of the crank member determine the angular sweep and the average angular speed of the brush head. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Reference is first made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which illustrates an electric toothbrush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the present invention. Toothbrush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provides a reciprocating, back-and-forth brushing action, with a large angular sweep during each stroke. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Toothbrush <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a drive mechanism <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and an output member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> drives drive mechanism <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and, in turn, output member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be any suitable compact electric motor. Power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is used to supply power to motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is preferably a battery, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but may alternately be a connection to an external power source, such as, for example, an electric wire and plug for connection to a standard 120VAC source. A control line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connects power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Control line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> schematically represents a suitable electrical connection between power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A switch <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is included on the housing, and connects to control line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to start and stop motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> surrounds motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, power source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and drive mechanism <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and can provide a base for mounting the components. Housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is made from a suitable, water impermeable plastic to prevent water from damaging the internal electrical components and to prevent a user from potential harm during use. Alternatively, housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be made from other suitable, water impermeable materials, such as a suitable metal, or from a composite of materials such as metal and plastic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which illustrate drive mechanism <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> drives an output shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, on which is mounted a pinion gear <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Output shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and pinion gear <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> rotate about a first axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which is the motor output axis. Pinion gear <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> drives the rotation of a first member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> First member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes an internal gear <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and rotates about a second axis <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. At the forward end of internal gear <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is a central disc <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Disc <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> has a first face <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) from which a central shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extends. The distal end of shaft <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rotates within a hole <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Disc <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> has a second face <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from which a bearing portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> extends. Bearing portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> has a bearing surface <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and an end face <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, from which an orbiting member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extends. Orbiting member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is positioned towards the outside edge of end face <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, so that as first member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> rotates about axis <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, orbiting member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> orbits about axis <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A second member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is attached to a square recess <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and to bearing portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of first member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Second member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes a bearing hoop <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> for supporting the rotation of bearing portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> therein. Bearing portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and bearing hoop <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> have substantially the same width. Orbiting member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, which is mounted on bearing portion <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, extends past the forward face of bearing hoop <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A third member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a body <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. A first shaft portion <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> extends rearwardly from body <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and is received in a hole <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in the second member <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> for rotation therein about a third axis <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. A second shaft portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> extends forwardly from body <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The third member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> includes a slotted arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, which extends radially from body <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> defines a slot <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> that receives and engages orbiting member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. As orbiting member <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> orbits about axis <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, the orbiting motion causes arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to reciprocate rotationally about axis <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. In use, arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> reciprocates through an angular sweep A<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>at an average angular speed W<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> reciprocates, it will have a range of angular speeds, ranging from a speed of zero at the ends of the reciprocation to a maximum speed in the middle of the reciprocation. Since the instantaneous speed of arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> varies depending on its position, the average angular speed is used for the purposes of this disclosure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Extending forwardly from arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is a gear member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> which is a section of an internal gear. A fourth member <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> includes a receiving hole <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> for receiving shaft portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> so that shaft portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can rotate therein. Fourth member <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> includes a bearing portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, in which is mounted output member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Output member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> rotates within bearing portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> about a fourth axis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, and includes at its rear end a spur gear member <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which is driven about axis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, through an angular sweep A<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at an average angular speed W<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>by gear member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> on third member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Gear member <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> has a smaller radius than gear member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The average angular speed W<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and the angular sweep A<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>of gear member <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> are larger than the average angular speed W<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and the angular sweep A<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>of gear member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> in inverse proportion to the ratio of their radii. Thus, a relatively large angular sweep and a high rotational speed are achieved in output member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> while keeping the angular sweep and the rotational speed relatively low in the arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the forward portion of output member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> protrudes through a hole in housing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and includes a square end portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, for the mounting of a brush head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, brush head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> includes a mounting portion <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> for receiving end portion <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of output member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> includes a brush head <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> that comprises an arrangement of bristles <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. Bristles <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> extend along an axis <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, that can be perpendicular from the forward end of head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and from fourth axis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> as shown. Alternately, bristles <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> can extend along an axis that is at some other angle from the forward end of head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> and from axis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. In use, brush head <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> reciprocates through angular sweep A<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at an average angular speed W<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, about fourth axis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Angular sweep A<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is different than angular sweep A<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and in the emobidment shown, angular sweep A<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is larger than angular sweep A<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Similarly, the average angular speed W<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is different than, and in the embodiment shown, larger than the average angular speed A<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. The sweeping action of the brush head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> along angular sweep A<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and at average angular speed W<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>simulates the back-and-forth brushing action that occurs when a person brushes their teeth with a manual toothbrush. Brush head member <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is removable for replacement when brush head <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> becomes worn or broken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Gear member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, first member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and second member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> not including gear member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> make up a first transmission, shown generally at <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Transmission <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> transfers rotational motion about axis <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, from output shaft <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of motor <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into rotational reciprocating motion of slotted arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> through angular sweep A<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>at average angular speed W<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Member <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, not including gear member <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is the output member for the first transmission <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Thus axis <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is the output member axis for the first transmission <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Gear members <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> make up a second transmission, shown generally at <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Transmission <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> transfers the rotational reciprocating motion of slotted arm <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> into rotational reciprocating motion of output member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> through angular sweep A<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>at average angular speed W<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, about axis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. Member <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> is the output member for the second transmission <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Thus axis <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is the output member axis for the second transmission <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which shows drive mechanism <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> assembled. It will be noted that axes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> are all parallel. This is useful in that all of the components of drive mechanism <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> occupy a relatively small volume, so that they can fit in a housing that is easy to grasp and hold in a user&apos;s hand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment transmission <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be any suitable means for transferring rotational motion into rotational reciprocating motion, and particularly rotational reciprocating motion about an axis parallel to that of the motor output shaft. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the second transmission <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be any suitable means for changing the angular sweep of reciprocation and the average angular speed of reciprocation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As shown, brush head <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> can have a circular arrangement of bristles <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, however, the brush head can have any suitable arrangement of bristles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As will be apparent to persons skilled in the art, various modifications and adaptations of the device described above are contemplated without departure from the present invention. </paragraph>
