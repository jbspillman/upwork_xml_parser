<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the manufacture of optical assemblies. More particularly this invention relates to the manufacture of a precisely aligned array of optical fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In the past, the assembly and manufacture of optical fiber arrays has been largely time consuming and prone to quality control problems. The latest developments in optical cross-connect assemblies have only magnified these problems. A general demand for more precisely constructed assemblies having greater reliability has translated into a demand for better manufacturing apparatus and processes. For example, the newest cross-connect assemblies place extreme importance on a well-adjusted optical system. These devices rely on the reception of modulated light on a light-receiving device from a multiplicity of fibers, in which the parameters of operation are precisely known differences in phase shift and polarization of the individual light beams. If the optical system is not finely tuned, then the device will not operate optimally, or may fail entirely. Precisely manufactured arrays of optical fibers are components of such cross-connect assemblies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One way of ensuring an optical fiber array of high quality is to increase labor intensity and quality control. The increased labor allows more time per optical fiber array for alignment and adjustment. Increased quality control results in rejection of substandard optical fiber arrays. The disadvantages of this approach are dramatically increased cost, and the discarding of parts and material upon recognition of failure. A better strategy is to manufacture storage devices with maximized quality and efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As mentioned previously, parts and labor are the most expensive elements of an optical fiber array. In the past, optical elements were positioned by hand. An assembler would hold the elements in place and apply glue. Quality control would later determine if the optical part were properly placed. The problem with this method is that in the case of a misplaced piece additional labor is uselessly added to an optical fiber array. Typically, any repair attempt destroys the glued part, and increases labor cost. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings, reference is made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, which illustrates a portion of a fiberoptic assembly that is aligned during manufacture in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. The fiber-optic assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a linear array of optical fibers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is secured within a housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The optical fibers <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are mutually aligned, such that their geometric centers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> lie along a straight line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. It is required that the deviation from co-linearity in the Y-axis of the geometric centers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> be maintained within a tolerance shown as the distance &ldquo;A&rdquo;, In the preferred embodiment the distance &ldquo;A&rdquo; cannot exceed two microns. Such close tolerances are essential for the fiberoptic assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to function correctly in devices such as optical switches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, wherein the fiberoptic assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown in further detail in an exploded view. The description of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is to be read in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a top portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Formed in each of the top portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are V-shaped grooves <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. When the top portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is approximated to the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, an optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is received by the grooves <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which hold the optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> firmly in position. Each of the optical fibers in the fiberoptic assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is similarly arranged. Nevertheless, it is technically difficult to align the optical centers of the fibers as required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, which illustrates an optico-mechanical assembly station that is constructed and operative in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention. An assembly station <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which is adapted for the manufacture of fiberoptic assemblies, such as the fiberoptic assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), comprises four sections: a optical fiber positioning sub-assembly <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, an optical fiber stabilizing sub-assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, a substrate holding sub-assembly <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> and a viewing section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In describing the assembly station <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and its operation, the following conventions are used herein. The Z-axis is nominally horizontal, and coincides with the optical axis of an optical fiber that is being held and manipulated. The X-axis refers to the horizontal axis that is orthogonal to the Z-axis. The Y-axis is the vertical axis, and is orthogonal to both the X and Z axes. Rotation about the X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis is referred to as theta-X, theta-Y and theta-Z motion respectively. Of course, it is possible to operate the assembly station <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in many positions and orientations, in which case the X-axis, Y-axis, and Z-axis are appropriately translated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is a top view of a portion of an assembly station <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> similar to that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a perspective view of a portion of the assembly station <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The description of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is to be read in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The optical fiber positioning sub-assembly <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a portion of the optical fiber stabilizing sub-assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are supported by a stage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The optical fiber positioning sub-assembly <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> includes an actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and an actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, which control movements of the stage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The optical fiber positioning sub-assembly <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> also includes a fiber rotator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, an actuator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which controls the fiber rotator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and a clamp <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> which secures a fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the fiber rotator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The optical fiber stabilizing sub-assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> includes a clamp <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, a clamp <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and a clamp <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which are carried on the stage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, for stabilizing a portion of the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> near the fiber rotator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The optical fiber stabilizing sub-assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> also includes a gripping assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a weight <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and a weight <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> for stabilizing the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> near the optical assembly into which it is to be incorporated. A bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of such an optical assembly is shown in a working position in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The substrate holding sub-assembly <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> includes a vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a hose <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> for supplying vacuum to the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, an actuator <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, an actuator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and a rotation control <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> for controlling movements of the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The viewing section <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> includes a video camera <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, which provides a view parallel to the Y-axis, and a stereo-microscope <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which is aligned generally with the Z-axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Reference is again made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The objectives of the operations performed by the assembly station <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are now presented in order to assist in understanding its structure and operation. Using the assembly station <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, each fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the fiberoptic assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sequentially secured in proper alignment to the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which can be a silicon slab. In some embodiments the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a grooved section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in which a plurality of V-grooves are aligned parallel to the Z-axis, and has a flat section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. When all the fibers have been secured such that their free ends lie in designated grooves of the grooved section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, horizontally aligned with one another. If the fibers are polarizing optical fibers, their polarization axes each have a desired alignment. The top portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is then affixed to the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as a separate operation to complete the assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Reference is again made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The stage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is provided for holding and manipulating components of the fiberoptic assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The stage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is capable of displacement along the Z-axis, and can be rotated about the Z-axis, using the actuators <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The fiber rotator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, adapted for gripping an individual fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the fiberoptic assembly during assembly, is mounted on the stage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and is oriented in the Z-axis. A slit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is provided in the fiber rotator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for receiving an optical fiber therethrough. The fiber rotator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> includes the actuator <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is capable of rotating the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> about its optical axis, with 360-degree freedom of rotation. In the case of polarization mounted single-mode fibers, this capability allows the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be aligned with respect to its polarization axis. The fiber rotator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is a known component, and a suitable version is available as model F265-R from Suruga Seiki, OST Division, Shizuoka, Japan. Cooperating with the fiber rotator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is the fiber gripping assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which opposes the fiber rotator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and is specialized to hold the optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> while it is seated in its designated groove of the grooved section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> during assembly. The gripping assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is mounted on the stage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> by a bracket <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight>. It can move independently in the X-axis, Z-axis, and is capable of theta-X and theta-Z motion as well. The bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is carried on a vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> having freedom of movement along the Y-axis and the X-axis, as well as having freedom of rotation about the Y-axis. The actuators <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the rotation control <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> control the movement of the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Vacuum is maintained by a vacuum hose <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which leads from the gripping assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to a suitable pump (not shown). Vacuum is provided to the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by a hose <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> for stabilizing the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The clamps <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> provide further stabilization for the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during the assembly and alignment operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The fiberoptic assembly under construction is viewed along the Y-axis on the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by the stereo-microscope <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>), which is conventional. In practice, the stereo-microscope <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can be linked to a monitor (not shown) for the convenience of the operator. The video camera <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, mounted on a movable stage <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, observes the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> horizontally, in line with the Z-axis. Using the video camera <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, the end face of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be visualized as it is being positioned in the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that while the video camera <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> has freedom of adjustment in the X, Y, and Z-axes independently, in operation there is no relative movement between the stage <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Using the stereo-microscope <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the video camera <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, the operator can view the process of assembly of the fiberoptic assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> along two orthogonal axes, the Y-axis and the Z-axis. The video camera <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is capable of high magnification, and is connected to a display monitor (not shown). Cameras suitable for the video camera <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are available from Mitutoya Corp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, which is a side elevation of the assembly station <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and illustrates additional components of the optical fiber stabilizing sub-assembly <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The description of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is to be read in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The gripping assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is disposed behind the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Vacuum is employed to urge the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> against the gripping assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> at a point near the end face of the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, such that stability of the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with respect to the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is assured during manipulation. The weights <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are mounted on a stage <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and are pivotable, as explained in further detail hereinbelow. Weights <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are preferably identical in structure. The stage <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is provided with an X-actuator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and a Z-actuator <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> that adjust the position of the stage <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in the X- and Z-axes, such that the free ends <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) can be accurately positioned over a desired portion of the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The weights <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> impinge on the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and more particularly on a portion of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> lying in the groove <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> while being currently manipulated. The weight <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is positioned to assist in coupling an optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into its assigned groove <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> at the edge of the silicon slab <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the weight <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is positioned in order to position the optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> onto the more proximal non-grooved portion of the silicon slab <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> by applying the weight <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to the optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, which illustrates the structure of the weights <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> in greater detail. The description of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is to be read in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. A wheel <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is affixed to both the weights <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, and pivots about an axis <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The wheel <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is counterweighted to provide precision in movement and weighting. A shaft <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is rigidly attached to the wheel <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, and extends radially in the direction of the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The shaft <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is dimensioned so that its free end <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> impinges on the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> as the wheel <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is revolved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, which illustrates the structure of the free end <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> of the shaft <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> in further detail. The description of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is to be read in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. A tip <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> extends downward from the shaft <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and terminates in a face <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. The face <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is a plane, which is angled with respect to the radial line formed by the shaft <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> with respect to its pivot, axis <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). The radial direction of the shaft <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is indicated by the line <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. It is important that the face <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> be parallel to the top surface of the silicon slab <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, which is mounted on the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. A plurality of cylindrical bores <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is formed in the shaft <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. The bores <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> receive cylindrical weights, which are selected to adjust the pressure that is exerted by the tip <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> against a fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that is being assembled into the silicon slab <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, which is a sectional view of a tip <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> of the gripping assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The description of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is to be read in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Two opposing jaws <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> are approximated to one another along a line <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, such that grooves <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> formed in the jaws <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> provide closed fluid channels leading to a vacuum pump (not shown) via the hose <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The grooves <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> open into a V-shaped groove <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> that is formed at the free end of the tip <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. An object, such as the smaller fiber <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> or a larger fiber <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is received into the groove <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The fiber <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> makes contact with the side walls <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> at points <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, creating a semi-closed region <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> where the air pressure is lower than the ambient air pressure. Consequently the fiber <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is urged against the side walls <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, and is held in a stable position thereon. It will be noted that the side walls <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> form tangent planes with the cylindrical outer surface of the fiber <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The tangent planes are represented as tangent lines on the sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. It is important that the groove <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> be dimensioned such that tangents are formed at the point of contact on the side walls <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> for the gripping assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to operate optimally. For example the fiber <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> contacts the side walls <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> at points <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and therefore is held successfully by the gripping assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. However a fiber larger than the fiber <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> would merely contact the tip <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> at cusps <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and would not form the requisite tangent plane. Its stability could not be assured. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Reference is again made to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The operation of the assembly station <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will now be disclosed. Initially a bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of a silicon slab is mounted on the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and held in place using the vacuum transmitted by the hose <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The stereo-microscope <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is adjusted to view the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and in particular the grooved section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Operations on an optical fiber are then begun. The fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is inserted through the slit <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> of the fiber rotator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, initially positioned such that it lies in a designated groove of the grooved section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, with its free end coinciding with the free edge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The fiber is then secured in the fiber rotator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> using the clamp <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. The positioning is accomplished by applying vacuum to the gripping assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and then by clamping the intermediate portion of the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the clamp <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the clamp <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and the clamp <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). Actuation of the gripping assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> provides the fine control needed to precisely place the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a desired position. The video camera <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is adjusted such that its direction of view is aligned with the Z-axis, and the free edge <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the free end of the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are visualized en face. The magnification of the video camera <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is adjusted such that the relationship of the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to its associated V-groove is seen clearly. The weight <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the weight <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are applied to the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to further immobilize it in a desired position so that it is aligned in the Y-axis with other optical fibers that are inserted in other grooves of the grooved section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, which shows an end view of an optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The description of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> is to be read in conjunction with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The view of the fiber-optic assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is similar to that seen by the video camera <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Two circles <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> define the polarization axis of the optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which may be adjusted by the operator such that they are in vertical alignment, indicated by their orientation with respect to the vertical line <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. The actuator <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the actuator <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> control movement of the stage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> independently of the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, so that the optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is allowed to move in the Z-axis or to undergo theta-Z motion relative to the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. During the alignment the operator also controls the actuator <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the actuator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the vacuum plate stage <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> so that the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the weights <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> can move in the X-axis and the Y-axis relative to the optical fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If it is necessary for the operator to move the weights <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> on the X-axis and the Z-axis relative to the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the X-actuator <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and the Z-actuator <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> are provided to control movements of the stage <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, which carries the weights <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The operator then rotates the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> about its optical axis using the fiber rotator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> until its polarization axis is in a desired orientation. In its final position, the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> rests in its designated V-groove of the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, is aligned with other optical fibers of the assembly in the Y-axis, and is rotationally aligned, such that its polarization axis has a desired orientation with respect to the Y-axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Suitable glue, such as UV-glue, is then applied in order to secure the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and allowed to cure. The gripping assembly <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, the clamp <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, the clamp <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and the clamp <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, the weight <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and the weight <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> are released, and the fiber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> removed from the fiber rotator <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The above described operations fiber are then repeated until all the V-grooves are occupied by optical fibers, or until a predetermined number of optical fibers have been emplaced in the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The assembly of the fiberoptic assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is completed by gluing the top portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the bottom portion <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with an epoxy glue to form a housing over the optical fibers, and then polishing the end faces of the optical fibers using known methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Alternate Embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The above described embodiment relies on skilled human operators. Reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, which semi-schematically illustrates an assembly station that is constructed and operative in accordance with an alternate embodiment of the invention. An assembly station <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> is similar to the assembly station <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment. However, the video camera has been replaced by a power and polarization detector <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight>. The output of the detector <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> is coupled to a suitable signal processor (not shown), which applies control signals to industrial motors <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> which drive the various actuators of the assembly station <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The actuators can thus be controlled automatically, without intervention of a human operator. </paragraph>
