<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> One of the features of the present invention is the use of both lateral sides of the bus bars to mount and entrap the bus bars between the housing pieces. Entrapping the bus bars in a suspended matter enables both sides of the bus bar to be used. This results in a much smaller electrical power connection block. This can take up less space on the member E. This invention can allow a method of making a factory connection at an OEM that enables the end user to make the power connection with a reliable lug terminal. The two pole lug block body described above consists of merely three molded plastic component housing pieces that interlock with each other trapping the two bus bars suspended in between them. The present invention uses the lateral sides of the bus bars as mounting ears for the bus bars. This can reduce the overall size of the connection block. If a three poll installation is required, then an additional center block <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and bus bar can be used side by side with the other components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Another one of the features of the present invention is in regard to the interlocking and keying nature of the interlock connection sections <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. As noted above, the projections <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> have different lateral lengths. Likewise, the recesses <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> have different lateral lengths. Thus, when the housing pieces <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are connected to each other even if the housing pieces are not precisely flush against each other the overlapping nature of the housing pieces prevent air gaps at the seams between the top side of the bottom sections and the bottom sides of the bottom sections. This prevents a possible incorrect air clearance and oversurface clearance between the bus bars and the member E. However, in alternate embodiments, any suitable type of overlapping of the housing pieces at their connection could be provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Another feature of the present invention is in regard to the modular design of the housing pieces <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The housing pieces are easily assembled without any special tools. The keying nature of the interlock connection sections <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> prevent the housing pieces from being incorrectly assembled relative to each other. Referring also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, an alternate embodiment of the electrical power connection block is shown. The embodiment shown is for a three poll connection. Thus, the connection block <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> comprises three electrical bus bars <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, and connection block housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In this embodiment, the connection block housing <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> generally comprises a first housing piece <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, a second housing piece <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, a third housing piece <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> and a fourth housing piece <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The first housing piece <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is identical to the first housing piece <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The fourth housing piece <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is identical to the third housing piece <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The second housing piece <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and the third housing piece <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> are identical to each other. The second and third housing pieces <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> are identical to the second housing piece <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Thus, three housing piece components can be used to form a housing container for either a two pole situation, as in the embodiment shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, or a three poll situation as in the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. This can reduce manufacturing costs and inventory costs. For the three poll situation, a person assembling the housing components merely adds a second one of the middle housing pieces and an additional bus bar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> It should be understood that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the invention. Various alternatives and modifications can be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the invention.
