<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A venturi incorporated in a pneumatic tube conveying system for flexible textile fabrics such as uniform and table linens handled in commercial laundries. The venturi includes an angled pipe which joins the main piping system at an acute angle and which receives air from a blower. An inside pipe is installed within the main piping to create a restriction at the connection of the venturi with the main piping. The restriction and angled connection of the venturi pipe creates a low pressure area which draws fabric articles through the piping and discharges them directly into receptacles such as sling carts. A screened vent in the piping downstream from the venturi allows the escape of air to enhance the reliability and efficiency of the pneumatic conveying system. The exposure of the vent can be adjusted by a sleeve that slides back and forth on the conveyor tube at the location of the vent. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to the pneumatic conveying of flexible fabrics such as uniforms, table linens and other articles handled by commercial laundries, as well as other fabric items that are conveyed between different locations in other types of applications. More particularly, the invention is directed to a method and apparatus that makes use of a specially constructed venturi to provide a suction force for pulling fabrics through conveyor tubes. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Commercial laundries handle large volumes of a variety of materials, including table cloths, napkins and other table linens used in restaurants and other food service operations. Uniforms worn by fast food service personnel and others are examples of other types of articles that are typically laundered by commercial laundries. A significant part of the operation of commercial laundries involves sorting the different types of articles while keeping track of where they came from and the number and types of articles that are to be laundered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Typically, the items are sorted at a sorting table or other sorting station. Like articles are then conveyed pneumatically to another location where they are further handled. Because flexible fabrics tend to ball up when pushed through pneumatic conveyor tubes, they are usually pulled through the tubing system by suction. The type of system that is most prevalent in commercial laundries makes use of vacuum bins that are each provided with a large vacuum motor. The vacuum that is applied to the vacuum bins pulls the laundry items through the conveyor tubes and into the bins. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Although vacuum bins of this type have achieved considerable popularity, they have not been satisfactory in all respects. Their relatively high cost adds appreciably to the capital costs of the laundry equipment. Furthermore, it is necessary for the items in the vacuum bins to be manually unloaded and placed on a conveyor which carries them to the location of receptacles that are typically flexible carts commonly referred to as sling carts. The articles must then be manually unloaded from the conveyor and placed in the sling carts. As can easily be appreciated, the need for all of these manual operations adds significantly to the overall labor costs. Finally, the vacuum bins and conveyors that transport articles from the bins to the sling carts occupy considerable space. This is particularly unsatisfactory in the case of commercial laundries because they are usually located in high cost urban areas where they are close to their major customers. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for conveying flexible fabric articles in an improved way that avoids the shortcomings of vacuum bin systems. In particular, the present invention provides a venturi system that dramatically reduces the equipment costs, labor costs and space requirements compared to vacuum bin systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, a uniquely arranged venturi structure is provided for applying a suction force at a selected location along the conveyor tube system rather than at its discharge end as is necessary with a vacuum bin system. Because the venturi is located along the conveyor tubing, the tubing can discharge the fabric items directly into sling carts or other receptacles, thus eliminating the space occupied by the vacuum bins and the intermediate conveying system as well as the labor that is required to manually unload the articles from the vacuum bins and to later load them into the sling carts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The venturi system of the present invention preferably includes an angled pipe which joins the conveyor tubing at an acute angle and is supplied with air by a blower. An inside pipe is located within the tubing at its juncture with the angled venturi pipe in order to provide a restriction that creates a low pressure area in the conveyor tubing. The resulting suction force draws the fabric articles to the area of the venturi and thereafter transports them a relatively short distance to the discharge end of the conveyor tubing by the positive force supplied by the blower. At the discharge end of the tubing, the fabric articles are discharged directly into receptacles such as sling carts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> An important feature of the invention is the provision of a vent in the conveyor tubing at a location downstream from the venturi. The vent is preferably a screened gap in the tubing which allows a portion of the air to escape. The vent significantly enhances the smoothness and reliability of the conveyor system by partially relieving the air pressure and thereby suppressing pressure fluctuations and other unfavorable pressure conditions that can adversely affect operation of the conveyor system. An adjustable sleeve in the preferred embodiment of the invention allows the width of the gap to be adjusted as necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Other and further objects of the invention, together with the features of novelty appurtenant thereto, will appear in the course of the following description.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for the pneumatic conveying of fabric materials such as table linens (table cloths, napkins and the like), uniforms, and other articles that are typically laundered in commercial laundries, as well as other flexible fabrics that are pneumatically conveyed in other applications. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates diagrammatically a pneumatic conveying system of the type that may be installed in a commercial laundry facility. A sorting table generally identified by numeral <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or a similar sorting station is used for the sorting of articles and may be equipped with a back panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a transparent window <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Pneumatic conveyor tubing generally identified by numeral <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extends from the back of the table and is located for the most part at an overhead location, although other locations are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> An opening <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may provide an input opening into which articles may be fed into a vertical tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is part of the conveyor tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. An elbow <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connects the top end of tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with an elevated horizontal conduit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> which terminates in a substantially straight end portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The conduit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may have virtually any desired configuration and can include bends and other offsets as may be necessary to avoid obstructions or extend the conveyor tubing to the desired location. The conduit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may incorporate a number of separate tube sections suitably coupled together. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The end portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of conduit <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is connected by a coupling <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with a conduit section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which has a substantially straight main body and a branch leg <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The leg <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has an axis that is oriented at an acute angle to the longitudinal axis of conduit section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The downstream end of conduit section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is connected with another conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. A vent opening between conduits <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is provided, preferably by a gap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that is covered with a mesh screen <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The ends of conduits <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are spaced apart so that the gap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> extends circumferentially around the conveyor tubing. The screen <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> covers the entirety of the gap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to prevent articles that are being conveyed from passing out of the conveyor tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> through the gap. A solid sleeve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is fitted closely around the downstream end of conduit section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and is adjustable in a manner to wholly or partially cover the screen <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> or to not cover the screen at all. The sleeve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> slides back and forth in order to vary the size of the gap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and thus vary its exposure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The downstream end of conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is provided with a plurality of serially arranged fittings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Each fitting <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has a discharge opening <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which is controlled by a flapper valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> or other device. The openings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be located and oriented as desired. The valves <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are controlled by a suitable control system (not shown) which is not a part of the present invention. Immediately underlying the discharge openings <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are respective receptacles <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which may take the form of sling carts or other types of receptacles or other devices such as belt conveyors that receive the fabric articles that discharge through the openings <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the fittings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The branch leg <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> forms part of a venturi arrangement constructed according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. A blower <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which may be mounted on the floor or elsewhere is powered by a motor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and forces air from the discharge side of the blower through piping that includes an inclined or angled pipe <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> leading to connection with the branch leg <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> in particular, an inside pipe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is suitably supported concentrically inside of the conduit section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and is positioned to overlie the inlet opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> formed at the intersection of the branch leg <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with the main body of conduit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The inside pipe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is smaller in diameter than the main body of conduit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to provide a restriction <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> adjacent to the downstream end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the inside pipe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The restriction <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is annular and creates a reduced volume region adjacent to the end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in order to provide a low pressure in the conduit section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the area of the downstream end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the inside pipe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is spaced downstream from the opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> by a distance identified by numeral <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. By way of example, the conduit end portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may be a six inch diameter pipe, with the main body of conduit section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> being an eight inch diameter pipe. The inside pipe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> preferably has approximately the same diameter as the end portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, or six inches in the case where the conduit end portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is a six inch pipe. With these dimensions, the distance <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is preferably about three inches, although the distance can vary considerably. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The inside pipe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> has an upstream end <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which is spaced downstream from the conduit end portion <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by a distance identified by numeral <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. With the pipe sizes given previously by way of example, the distance <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be approximately six to seven inches, although this dimension can also vary considerably without adversely affecting the operation of the system. Both ends of the inside pipe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> are open so that the fabric articles that are being conveyed through the tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can pass through pipe section <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. With the pipe sizes given, the length of the inside pipe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> may be about 24 inches, although variations are possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The screen <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is preferably cylindrical and is fitted over the downstream end of conduit section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and secured thereon by a band type pipe strap <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> or other suitable means. The screen <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is fitted around the upstream end of conduit <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and secured by a band type strap <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> or another suitable means. Connecting screen <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in this fashion connects conduits <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to one another. The distance between the downstream end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the inside pipe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the gap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is preferably no less than <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> inches and can be considerably greater. The length of the gap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> between the ends of the conduits <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be approximately six inches, although the length of the gap can vary considerably depending upon a number of factors, including the sizes of the pipes and blower and the location of the gap relative to the venturi. The width of the gap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can also be adjusted by sliding the sleeve <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> to control its exposure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In operation, the blower <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> operates to force air through the inclined pipe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the branch leg <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> into conduit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the restriction <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The abrupt change in volume provided by the restriction <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> creates a low pressure area adjacent to the downstream end <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the inside pipe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Fabric articles that are loaded into the conveyor tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are drawn through the conduits <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and into the conduit section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> by the suction resulting from the low pressure area, and the articles are drawn through the inside pipe <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Downstream from the venturi, the articles are conveyed to the discharge fittings <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> by the positive force of the air supplied by the blower <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The flapper valves <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are suitably controlled to open a selected one of the valves <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, such as the valve of fitting <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The articles are then deflected by the flapper valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> through the discharge opening <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and into the underlying receptacle <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> identified as receptacle &num;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Different articles are similarly deposited into the other receptacles <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> by opening the flapper valve <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> associated with the corresponding fitting <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. It should be understood that virtually any desired number of discharge fittings can be provided and that other types of discharge systems can be used in connection with the pneumatic conveying system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The vent effect provided by the gap <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is an important feature of the invention because it allows a portion of the air supplied by the blower <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to escape from the conveyor tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The escape of some of the air avoids significant pressure fluctuations and other unfavorable pressure conditions in the tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, thereby enhancing the reliability of the conveying system and assuring that it operates smoothly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The suction effect created by the venturi of the present invention is applied at a selected location along the conveyor tubing <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> rather than at the discharge end of the tubing as is necessary with a vacuum bin system. Consequently, the fabric articles that are being conveyed can be deposited directly into the receptacles <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, rather than having to be removed from a vacuum bin and separately conveyed to the location of the receptacles <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> where an additional manual operation of depositing the articles in the receptacles <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is required. Thus, the venturi system of the present invention is a substantial improvement over a vacuum bin system in a number of respects, namely, the elimination of the high cost of the vacuum bins and the large vacuum motors they require, a reduction in the labor that is required, and a reduction in the amount of space occupied by the equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted to attain all ends and objects hereinabove set forth together with the other advantages which are obvious and which are inherent to the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that certain features and subcombinations are of utility and may be employed without reference to other features and subcombinations. This is contemplated by and is within the scope of the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Since many possible embodiments may be made of the invention without departing from the scope thereof, it is to be understood that all matter herein set forth or shown in the accompanying drawings is to be interpreted as illustrative, and not in a limiting sense. </paragraph>
