<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates in general to envelopes, and more specifically, to envelopes having a greeting card combined therewith. In particular, this invention relates to an envelope and a greeting card made from a single envelope blank, wherein the greeting card is separable from the envelope by lines of perforation. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the greeting card industry, manufacturers must utilize not only the appropriate machinery for producing the cards, but also the appropriate machinery for producing the envelopes in order to affect cost savings. Thus, at a minimum, two expensive pieces of machinery, as well as two separate manufacturing processes, must be employed by the greeting card manufacturers to accomplish the task of manufacturing each greeting card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In addition, standard bi-fold greeting cards are often displayed by their recipients by standing them up on a level surface. This method is not always satisfactory, as such a bi-fold card lacks adequate stability to withstand even light breezes, which can be caused by simply walking past the displayed card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is, therefore, an advantage of the present invention to provide a combination envelope and greeting card, wherein a single blank can be formed, on a single machine and in a single process, into both the mailing envelope and the greeting card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is another advantage of the present invention to provide an envelope which includes a greeting card, wherein upon opening the envelope and unfolding the card panels thereof, a greeting card is formed which can be separated from the envelope by lines of perforation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is yet another advantage of the present invention to provide a combination envelope and greeting card, which further includes a detachable display strip for displaying the greeting card in a stable manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Additional advantages, objects, and novel features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following, or may be learned by practice of the invention. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention comprises a combination envelope and greeting card formed from a single blank. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to one embodiment of the present invention, a combination envelope and greeting card made from a blank is disclosed and comprises a front panel having opposed side edges and a back panel having opposed side edges, the front and back panels being connected along a line of perforation or a fold line, two side flap receiving panels extending from the back panel at the side edges thereof and connected thereto along a line of perforation, the side flap receiving panels adapted to receive a portion of the back panel when the blank is formed into an envelope, a seal flap structure extending from the front panel opposite the back panel and connected thereto at a fold line, and a detachable card structure, the detachable card structure comprising the back panel, and at least one additional panel extending from the back panel. The front panel can further comprise two side flaps extending from therefrom at the side edges thereof, each side flap connected to the front panel along a fold line. The seal flap structure can include an adhesive strip assembly and a detachable display strip portion.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawing depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> blank <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for making a combination envelope and greeting card is depicted. The blank <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for the combination envelope/greeting card comprises a front panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a back panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> connected by a perforated fold line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, a seal flap structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> connected at a fold line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to front panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> opposite back panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. First and second side flaps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are connected to front panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> at fold lines <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, respectively, and first and second side flap receiving panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are connected to back panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at perforated lines <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, respectively. A first card panel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is connected at a fold line <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to back panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> opposite front panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The seal flap structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is comprised of an adhesive seal strip <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> positioned toward the edge of the seal flap structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a detachable display strip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> positioned between adhesive seal strip <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and fold line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Adhesive seal strip <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> includes an adhesive seal assembly <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> which can be any suitable adhesive means, including a pressure sensitive adhesive covered by a removable protective strip, a remoistenable strip of glue, or the like. Detachable display strip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is bounded on two sides by perforation lines <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which are parallel to fold line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and extend across the entire width of seal flap structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Detachable display strip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> includes an adhesive display assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Similarly, adhesive display assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> can be any suitable adhesive means, including a pressure sensitive adhesive covered by a removable protective strip, a remoistenable strip of glue, or the like. Detachable display strip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can be disassociated from the seal flap structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at the perforation lines <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and is then available for use in displaying the detachable card structure <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, as will be described below. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the adhesive seal strip <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the seal flap assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown being detached from display strip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> along perforation line <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Similarly, in use, display strip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> can then be completely detached from the envelope at perforation line <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the relative positioning of the adhesive seal strip <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the detachable display strip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> could be reversed without departing from the teachings of the present invention. This alternative seal flap structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is equally useful with the envelope blanks depicted in the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 8</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A detachable card structure <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> comprises back panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and first card panel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Detachable card structure <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can be disassociated from the blank at lines of perforation <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows side flap receiving panel <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> being removed from back panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along perforation line <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Similarly, side flap receiving panel <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can also be removed from back panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along perforation line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Finally, back panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be detached from front panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> along perforated fold line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Upon disassociation, detachable card structure <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> functions as a complete, separate greeting card <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, as can best be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The embodiment of the type shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> includes a greeting card <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which comprises a bi-fold card. This card can be displayed by standing it up, and if desired to more securely display the card <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> in such a manner, a portion of the bottom of card <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can be adhered to the adhesive display assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the detachable display strip <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to securely display the card <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the pouch <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the envelope of the present invention is formed by folding the side flaps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> along fold lines <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, respectively. Card panel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is first folded over back panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along fold line <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and detachable card structure <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is then folded over front panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> along perforated fold line <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Side flaps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are thus received by side flap receiving panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, respectively. Alternatively, side flaps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be positioned over side flap receiving panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. To close the envelope, seal flap structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is folded over the exterior surface <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of back panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> along fold line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. When it is desired for the envelope to be sealed, adhesive seal assembly strip <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> is adhered to the back panel exterior surface <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Of course, it is understood that alternative envelope structures are within the scope of the present invention. As one example, an envelope can be formed from an alternative blank similar to that depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but without side flaps <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, side flap receiving panels <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> would simply be received onto front panel <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Similar alternatives could be useful in connection with the blanks depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6, 8</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, discussed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> What is important with any alternative envelopes suitable for use in connection with the present invention is that the formation of the envelope does not require the use or placement of adhesives on the greeting card structure <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which would mar the surfaces of that structure <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Fugitive adhesives, of course, could be positioned on the greeting card structure <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> if needed, as long as the surfaces of the structure <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are not marred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, card panel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a photograph retaining structure <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This structure <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> comprises a transparent cover <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> affixed by an adhesive assembly <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to the interior surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the card panel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As depicted in the drawing, the adhesive assembly <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> comprises a c-shaped strip of adhesive which fixedly receives a first portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the periphery of the transparent cover <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to secure the cover <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to the interior surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the card panel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A second portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the periphery of the transparent cover <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> remains open, or unsealed, to allow a photograph or other item to be displayed to be placed or slid under the transparent cover <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. First periphery portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> comprises a sufficient amount of the periphery of the cover <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> so as to ensure that the cover <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and any item displayed thereunder will be secured onto the card panel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and second periphery portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> comprises a sufficient amount of the periphery of the cover <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> so as to allow the item to be displayed to be inserted under the cover <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, while being securely retained therein. It is understood that the photograph retaining structure <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be positioned on either first card panel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or back panel <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, or alternatively, both panels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can include a photograph retaining structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> While the photograph retaining structure <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is shown as being generally rectangular in shape, it is understood that any suitable shape is within the scope and understanding of the present invention. Likewise, the adhesive assembly <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which is to be associated with any such shape of the photograph retaining structure <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be of any shape which is suitable to secure the corresponding photograph retaining structure <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, more than one card panel can be included in the combination envelope and greeting card of the present invention. This embodiment provides an envelope blank <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> similar to that depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> above. The blank <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> for this embodiment comprises a front panel <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and a back panel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> connected by a perforated fold line <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, a seal flap structure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> connected at a fold line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to front panel <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> opposite back panel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. First and second side flaps <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are connected to front panel <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> at fold lines <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, respectively, and first and second side flap receiving panels <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> are connected to back panel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> at perforated lines <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, respectively. A first card panel <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is connected at a fold line <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to back panel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> opposite front panel <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. A second card panel <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is connected at a fold line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight> to first card panel <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> opposite back panel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The seal flap structure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is similar to that in the first embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, and includes an adhesive seal strip <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> positioned toward the edge of the seal flap structure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and a detachable display strip <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> positioned between adhesive seal assembly <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and fold line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Adhesive seal strip <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> includes an adhesive seal assembly <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> which can be any suitable adhesive means, including a pressure sensitive adhesive covered by a removable protective strip, a remoistenable strip of glue, or the like. Detachable display strip <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is bounded on two sides by perforation lines <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, which are parallel to fold line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and extend across the entire width of seal flap structure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Detachable display strip <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> includes an adhesive display assembly <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the adhesive display assembly <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> can be any suitable adhesive means, including a pressure sensitive adhesive covered by a removable protective strip, a remoistenable strip of glue, or the like. Detachable display strip <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> can be disassociated from the seal flap structure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> at the perforation lines <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and is then available for use in displaying the detachable card structure <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, as will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The detachable card structure <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> of this embodiment comprises back panel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, first card panel <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, and second card panel <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the envelope can be similarly formed, with second card panel <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> first being folded over first card panel <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> along fold line <highlight><bold>143</bold></highlight>, and then this combination of panels <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> is next folded over back panel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> along fold line <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. As with the embodiment in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the detachable card structure <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> can then be folded over front panel <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> along perforated fold line <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Side flaps <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are thus received by side flap receiving panels <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, respectively. To close the envelope, seal flap structure <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is folded over the exterior surface of back panel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> along fold line <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. When it is desired for the envelope to be sealed, adhesive seal assembly strip <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> is adhered to the exterior surface of back panel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, an alternate embodiment of the present invention is shown. A blank <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is depicted and comprises a front panel <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and a back panel <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> connected by a fold line <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight>, a seal flap structure <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (similar to those discussed in connection with the above embodiments) connected at a perforated fold line <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight> to front panel <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> opposite back panel <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. Seal flap structure <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> includes an adhesive seal strip <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> positioned toward the edge of the seal flap structure <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and a detachable display strip <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> positioned between adhesive seal assembly <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and fold line <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Adhesive seal strip <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> includes an adhesive seal assembly <highlight><bold>245</bold></highlight> which can be any suitable adhesive means, including a pressure sensitive adhesive covered by a removable protective strip, a remoistenable strip of glue, or the like. Detachable display strip <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> is bounded on two sides by perforation lines <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, which are parallel to fold line <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and extend across the entire width of seal flap structure <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Detachable display strip <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> includes an adhesive display assembly <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the adhesive display assembly <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> can be any suitable adhesive means, including a pressure sensitive adhesive covered by a removable protective strip, a remoistenable strip of glue, or the like. Detachable display strip <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> can be disassociated from the seal flap structure <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> at the perforation lines <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, and is then available for use in displaying the detachable card structure <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>, as will be described below. First and second side flaps <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> are connected to front panel <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> at fold lines <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, respectively, and first and second side flap receiving panels <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> are connected to back panel <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> at perforated lines <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>, respectively. Perforated lines <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> also extend across front panel <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> from fold line <highlight><bold>219</bold></highlight> to perforated fold line <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>. Photograph retaining structure <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> (similar to that discussed above in connection with the previous embodiment) is shown positioned on front panel <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. It is not essential that the photograph retaining structure <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> be positioned on the front panel <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. As an alternative to the blank displayed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the photograph retaining structure <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> can instead be positioned on the back panel <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, or separate photograph retaining structures <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> can be positioned on both on panels <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. In yet another alternative embodiment, the blank does not include a photograph retaining structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A detachable card structure <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> comprises front panel <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and back panel <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, and can be disassociated from the blank <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> at lines of perforation <highlight><bold>223</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. Upon disassociation, detachable card structure <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> functions as a complete, separate greeting card <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, as can best be seen in the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. Greeting card <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> comprises a bi-fold card which can be displayed by standing it up, and if desired to more securely display the card <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> in such a manner, a portion of the bottom of card <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> can be adhered to the adhesive display assembly <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> of the detachable display strip <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> to securely display the card <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, another embodiment of the present invention is depicted, wherein a blank <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> comprises a front panel <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> and a back panel <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> connected by a fold line <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight>, and a seal flap structure <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> (similar to those discussed in connection with the above embodiments) connected at a perforated fold line <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight> to front panel <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> opposite back panel <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. First and second side flaps <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> are connected to front panel <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> at fold lines <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, respectively, and first and second side flap receiving panels <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> are connected to back panel <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> at perforated lines <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>, respectively. Perforated lines <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> also extend across front panel <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> from fold line <highlight><bold>319</bold></highlight> to perforated fold line <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>. A first card panel <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is connected at a fold line <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> to back panel <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> opposite front panel <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Photograph retaining structure <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> (similar to that discussed above in connection with the previous embodiments) is shown positioned on front panel <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. It is not essential that the photograph retaining structure <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> be positioned on the front panel <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. As an alternative to the blank displayed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the photograph retaining structure <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> can instead be positioned on the back panel <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> or the first card panel <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, or on any combination of the panels <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. In yet another alternative embodiment, the blank does not include a photograph retaining structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A detachable card structure <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> comprises front panel <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, back panel <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and first card panel <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. This card structure <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> can be disassociated from the blank <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> at lines of perforation <highlight><bold>323</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight>. Upon disassociation, detachable card structure <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> functions as a complete, separate tri-fold greeting card. Although not depicted in the drawings, as with the previous embodiments, this tri-fold greeting card can be displayed using the detachable display strip <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight> and associated adhesive display assembly <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The combination envelope and greeting card of the present invention is adapted for use first as an envelope, if so desired. Subsequent to such use, or as an alternative to such use, the greeting card portion can be utilized as follows. With the embodiments shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the combination envelope and greeting card can be sold in the form of a kit, wherein the envelope blank is either not folded or is folded with the sides unsealed, allowing the greeting card to be personalized by the sender prior to the formation of the envelope. In the embodiment depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, wherein a photograph retaining structure is included, a photograph or other item to be displayed can be positioned under the transparent cover prior to formation of the envelope by folding the blank. Alternatively, the envelope can be preformed and presealed, eliminating the ability to include any personalization on the inside of the card. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> With the embodiments shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the envelope can either be sold as a kit (i.e., unfolded or folded with the sides unsealed, as discussed above), or alternatively the envelope can first be formed from the blank prior to use. In this situation, the positioning of the photograph retaining structure <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> on the front panel <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> of the blank allows the user to access an unsealed portion of the periphery of the transparent cover <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> for inserting a photograph or other item to be retained therein, even after the blank has been formed into an envelope with the sides sealed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it will be seen that this invention is one well adapted to attain all the ends and objects hereinabove set forth, together with other advantages which are obvious and which are inherent to the structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that certain features and subcombinations are of utility and may be employed without reference to other features and subcombinations. This is contemplated by and is within the scope of the claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Since many possible embodiments may be made of the invention without departing from the scope thereof, it is to be understood that all matter herein set forth or shown in the accompanying drawings is to be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. </paragraph>
