<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to parts review processes in a manufacturing environment, and more particularly, the present invention relates to a method and system for reviewing parts usage, assessing related risks, developing an action plan for non-preferred parts, and providing this information to developers and procurement parties over a communications network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is generally known in the manufacturing industry that a product is only as good as its collective components. In the early design phase of a product development cycle, design engineers are tasked with selecting the parts that will be incorporated into a product design. While the selections made by the designer may be technically sound, they may not always be the most cost effective from a financial standpoint because the designer is not privy to important business data such as cost rebates available from a particular supplier. Further, these part selections may not be the most pragmatic from a logistical standpoint since the designer is not equipped with the business skills or knowledge of a procurement specialist. Procurement specialists evaluate the business risks associated with part selection by examining various factors such as reliability, supplier technology and capability, availability, etc. However, procurement specialists are not generally knowledgeable about the technical or functional aspects of the parts or assemblies. As a result, there may be parts used by development that include some business and/or technical risks. Currently, there is no way for an enterprise to alert its development personnel of these risks and no capability to assess the action plans in order to minimize them. It is, therefore, desirable to provide a method and system for reviewing parts usage, finding problems or risk parts, and defining the actions that should be taken to mitigate the risks. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, evaluation teams and council members for an enterprise determine which components a designer should consider first for use in a design. These components are referred to as &lsquo;preferred parts&rsquo;. Using a preferred part may mean that development and procurement experts who make up these teams/councils have determined that the part is readily available in the industry (no supply issues), is technically sound, will be available throughout the life of a specified program, and is being procured at the lowest cost available. It is understood that other criteria may be used to determine a preferred part. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> A preferred part is one that the technology development councils have determined to be of more value to the enterprise from a technical and business standpoint as compared to another part. Preferred parts are further defined by two areas&mdash;technology and suppliers. The following criteria are used for defining preferred parts according to technology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Industry standard. This element is concerned with whether or not the part is readily available from the industry. Wide acceptance of a part in the industry usually means good supply and price. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Number of suppliers. The number of suppliers producing the technology is helpful in assessing whether or not sufficient suppliers exist to satisfy enterprise and industry demand. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Continuity of supply. This factor addresses whether there are any known issues or technical events that may affect supply. For example, a natural disaster such as an earthquake or a serious fire may affect a supplier&apos;s ability to manufacture parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Adequate lead times/capacity. This element is concerned with the amount of planning needed to ensure continuity of supply. Long lead times usually mean insufficient supply. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Quality/reliability. This element addresses whether or not there are any known issues that may affect the enterprise&apos;s ability to ship a product due to a supplier&apos;s manufacturing and/or design issue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Manufacturability. This factor establishes whether the technology under evaluation lends itself to problem free assembly in the enterprise-designated assembly facility. For example, a certain package design may be more difficult to solder onto a card versus another package design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Technical advantage. This element assesses whether the use of this technology gives the enterprise a technical advantage in the market place. For example, one type of part may increase a machine&apos;s technical performance as compared to another type of part (microprocessor A works better in a design than microprocessor B). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Position in the technology life cycle. This item addresses whether this technology will be available for the life of an enterprise program or whether there will be a need to execute an end-of-life exercise. An end-of-life exercise includes analysis of total parts requirements (from many machines or designs) for the remainder of a manufacturing period (e.g., from today until the date manufacturing will stop), establishing supply to fulfill those requirements, and inventory storage of the parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The following criteria are used for defining preferred parts according to supplier selection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Supplier technology. Suppliers are compared to one another in the areas of quality/reliability; the ability to offer leading edge technology, steps they are taking to improve technology, and the ease with which the supplier may be qualified for the enterprise&apos;s products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Supplier menu. Supplier menu refers to the nature and scope of its product offerings and how well the supplier&apos;s offerings match enterprise needs (i.e., technology road map convergence as discussed further herein). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Pricing. This factor looks not only at current price offerings but also whether the supplier provides aggressive pricing throughout the product life, whether the pricing is aggressive in beating the market average, and whether the supplier&apos;s pricing is aggressive across its entire offering as opposed to only select areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Capacity. Capacity refers to whether the supplier has the manufacturing capacity to meet enterprise or industry demand and whether it is flexible in moving from one product set to another if market conditions dictate a change. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Service. This factor assesses a supplier&apos;s serviceability to the enterprise in terms of delivery, communication, recovery capability, technical support and Electronic Data Interchange capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above-described criteria, other factors may be employed by an enterprise as desired in order to establish a preferred parts definition. It should be noted that the parts review process tool can be implemented for use in any electronics-based industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In contrast to preferred parts described above, non-preferred parts are those which have been found to have some type of associated risk that needs to be addressed. There are varying degrees of risk based on the enterprise&apos;s business and technical requirements. Risk types range from a part that will go end-of-life during the time which the product will be using the part to a part that is no longer available requiring the substitution of a new part. Utilizing the technology and supplier criteria listed above, the parts review process tool&apos;s action plan will be executed only on these non-preferred parts to determine if the risk of using this part may impact the program&apos;s revenue commitment. If the risk is accepted, a mitigation plan will be developed to minimize the risk. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Once a strategy or preferred parts action plan is in place, it is communicated to all development personnel and other interested parties of the enterprise via a web site. The web site contains a visual picture of the strategy, i.e., roadmap, a methodology to find a list of parts that match the roadmap, a contact list, a price projection, and market conditions (current and future predicted). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Establishing a preferred parts list is only a portion of the process necessary to ensure that optimal resources are being utilized by the enterprise. A preferred part can easily become non-preferred overnight. Ongoing reviews of technology and suppliers qualifications may be necessary. Existing parts become obsolete while emerging technologies continue to offer new and improved parts in the market place. Furthermore, design groups may tend to develop loyalties to existing parts with which they are familiar, without consideration of whether the parts continue to be cost effective for the enterprise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The parts review tool of the present invention provides a means for information gathering of parts usage, collaborative evaluation of technical properties and business factors relating to parts available in the industry, and deployment of preferred parts strategies via a communications network across an enterprise. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary embodiment, the parts review process tool is implemented via a network system such as that depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. System <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which is operating in a client/server architecture mode whereby groupware applications and file distribution software are executed by system server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and/or council server <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> on behalf of requesting client systems <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Groupware applications are well known to those skilled in the art and include email, messaging, calendaring, and a host of multi-media tools. Likewise, client systems of enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> employ suitable client-side applications for facilitating the groupware tools utilized by enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> such as web browser programs and email software. Enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is also executing application software used by the parts review process tool including spreadsheet software such as Lotus 1-2-3 (TM) and database management software such as IBM&apos;s DB2 (TM). Enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> further comprises an evaluation team <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> with client systems <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, each in communication via a communications link <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Client system <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> represents a procurement engineer, system <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> represents a procurement business specialist, and system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> represents a development engineer. It is understood that any number of client systems may be used in order to realize the advantages of the invention. Evaluation team <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> evaluates non-preferred parts usage for divisions of enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with respect to a commodity. Evaluation team <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is responsible for looking at the non-preferred parts usage, determining any associated risks in using the part, and developing an action plan designed to minimize these risks. Evaluation team <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> pulls business people from procurement and technical people from both procurement engineering and development. Enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may support evaluation teams for each commodity related to its business and commodity evaluation teams may be further broken down as needed into sub-commodity teams or otherwise as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Client system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> represents a design engineer from a division of enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> who designs and develops electronic assemblies or products for enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Client system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is also connected to communications link <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. System server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> provides typical engineering resources to employees of enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> such as CAD software and other design tools. Server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> also retrieves data stored in data storage device <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> for use by authorized client systems of enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Data storage device <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> houses databases used by enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> employees including the parts review process tool of the invention. Databases of data storage device <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> include a parts database <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, a bill of material (BOM) review database <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, a deviation database <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and a history database <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> all of which are explained further herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Parts database <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> contains a list of all part numbers utilized by enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as well as associated data. The preferred definition, as well as a description of the part, comes from database <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> BOM review database <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> contains a list of parts that make up different parts of a machine as entered on a bill of material. Bills of materials are submitted by developers of enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> such as design engineer client system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> who requests that a new part be released or to determine the current status of a part in parts database <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. Deviation database <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> uses database <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> as the main source for determining which parts need to be reviewed by evaluation team <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Deviation database <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> contains all non-preferred parts extracted from database <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> along with key data that identifies the part and the program that uses the part. This database also contains data describing why the part was used and the status of the risk review. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> History database <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> stores the results of the evaluations performed for statistical and trend analysis as described further herein and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Also included in enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is technology development council <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> which comprises client systems <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. Technology development council <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is responsible for defining and communicating the preferred parts policies on an enterprise-wide level. Technology council <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is commissioned to develop and communicate to enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and suppliers a consistent strategy regarding enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>&apos;s use of designated parts. Council <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> may be staffed from technical members of each division of enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and from procurement engineering. Due to the complex nature of some divisions, it may be appropriate to include multiple people from the same division sitting on the council. Client system <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> represents a representative of a division&apos;s development group, client system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> represents a procurement representative, and client system <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> represents a representative of another division&apos;s development group. It is understood that any number of client systems may be used by enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Numerous division representatives may be assigned to the council and numerous councils may be created as needed. One council person from each division is selected to be the deviation process focal point for that division. This division representative is responsible for gathering the data needed to evaluate the non-preferred parts use. Council <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> also employs council server <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> for accessing the parts review process tool and retrieving information from data storage device <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> as needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Client system <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> represents a system administrator for enterprise system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> who assists in transporting the bill of material data provided by a design engineer client system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to deviation database <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> for assessment. System administrator client system <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> is described further in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is connected to a network (e.g., Internet) in order to facilitate communications with outside entities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates the process involved in establishing and communicating a preferred parts usage plan in a preferred embodiment of the invention. A design engineer of enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> inputs a bill of materials into BOM review database <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> via client system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> at step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. On a periodic basis (e.g., weekly), system server <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> performs extractions from BOM review database <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of non-preferred parts appearing on the stored bills of material at step <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The extraction records are exported to a spreadsheet file at step <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. This step is used where outputs obtained from database <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are incompatible with information supplied by deviation database <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, however, it may be eliminated by integrating the two databases via systems software or hardware. Division representative <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> of technology development council <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is identified and associated with each record in the file by comparing data contained in the extraction record to data provided by deviation database <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. The system administrator at client system <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> imports the spreadsheet file to deviation database <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> at step <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> where irrelevant data is filtered out from the record and relevant data is captured. Enterprise <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may establish the criteria to be used for defining relevant data.

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Program Manager. Manager for the design project. This information is obtained by the division representative via the questionnaire of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Supplier Name. Supplier Name as identified in BOM database <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Classification. Part classification or category as identified in BOM database <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Type. Part type as identified in BOM database <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Other information such as size, units, density may be included here as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Deviation database <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> automatically notifies division representative <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> by email along with a link to the site questionnaire (also referred to as requester questionnaire) of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> at step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Division representative <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> then contacts the project design team (not shown) of the BOM which comprises the design engineer of client system <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and an engineering group to which the design engineer is assigned. Division representative <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> then gathers the information requested by the questionnaire at step <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. The responses to the questionnaire are then inputted by division representative <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> at step <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> followed by selecting the submit button <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> at step <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the division representative <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> may enter information and save it as a draft (not shown) at step <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> if the data requested is still forthcoming. Once submitted, an alert is sent by the tool to evaluation team <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> notifying them that an assessment is required at step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. The evaluation team reviews the request/response and accesses related data from parts database <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, BOM database <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, Deviation database <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, history database <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, along with market analysis and industry trends for consideration. A questionnaire is provided by the tool as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> to aid team <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> in their assessment. Once completed, there are four courses of action possible for the evaluation team (step <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>). At step <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, if the risk is determined to be low, no action may be required. For example, the part is non-preferred because it is a card made for only one machine (wide usage is one of the requirements for preferredness). If the card is built with components that are preferred, the risk is low, thus no action is required. Another example might be where the system has a migration path to allow replacement of the non-preferred part with a preferred part and has a plan to move to the preferred solution when necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> A second course of action requires council review at step <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>. This is where evaluation team <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> feels that technology development council <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> should reevaluate its position regarding the status of this part. A third course of action requests that a change be implemented at step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The evaluation team has reviewed the data and has determined that the risk is too high to allow the use of the non-preferred part. A request has been made to the developer to modify the design to use a preferred part. Finally, at step <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> immediate attention may be required where the device being used is very high risk. This may require that an action plan be developed to reduce or eliminate the risk. Typical conditions that would trigger this response would include the use of an end-of-life component or a component from a high risk supplier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> All evaluations and results are saved to history database <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> for future assessments and trend analysis. Once the data begins to flow into the database, analysis is critical to determine the steps needed to drive down the non-preferred parts request percentage. Measurements can be broken down into two sections: Database Management and Trend Analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Database management provides that turnaround time and form closure are tracked to make sure the forms are being closed on a timely basis. The following details may be measured on a site-by-site basis: turnaround time from start to finish, turnaround time to close the requester questionnaire (measured from time note was sent), turnaround time to close the evaluation (measured from time requester closes section), and status <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Trend analysis include trends such as why a division is using a non-preferred part will help the council in developing action plans that will help drive the non-preferred request percentage down. The following areas will be grouped by site and division and the results evaluated: action <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, requester response distributions by division; why are you using non-preferred parts, action <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>; what are the dollars saved by using this part, action <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>; what is the expected life of the program, action <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, what is the projected revenue of this program, action <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>; and what are the average expected yearly volumes for this part number, action <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As described above, the present invention can be embodied in the form of computer-implemented processes and apparatuses for practicing those processes. The present invention can also be embodied in the form of computer program code containing instructions embodied in tangible media, such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, hard drives, or any other computer-readable storage medium, wherein, when the computer program code is loaded into and executed by a computer, the computer becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention.
