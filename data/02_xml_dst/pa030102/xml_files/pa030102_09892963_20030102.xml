<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of network systems, and more particularly to blocking packets of data sent by a client to a server that results in a server overload where the packets may be blocked at routers located on the server and client side of the network system including intermediary routers. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A network system may comprise a host machine, e.g., server computer on the Internet commonly referred to as web server, connected via the Internet to one or more computers commonly referred to as clients. The Internet may refer to a network of computers. One or more clients may be connected to the Internet through one or more routers which enable the one or more clients to communicate with the web server. The web server may be connected to the Internet through one or more routers which enable the server to communicate with the one or more clients. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Clients may communicate with the web server by sending a number of packets in a given time interval through one or more routers for the server to process. If the number of packets that need to be serviced in a given time exceeds the capability of the web server, the server may become overloaded thereby causing the server to process the packets at a slower rate or even crash. A client that purposely sends an excessive number of packets to overload the web server may commonly be referred to as a &ldquo;malicious client.&rdquo;</paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A server overload including a server crash is at the very least annoying, and may result in serious or irreparable damage. By overloading the server, clients coupled to the server may have to wait a longer period of time to have their requests serviced. Furthermore, if the server crashes, i.e., becomes inoperative, clients coupled to the server may no longer have the ability to communicate with the server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It would therefore be desirable to at least in part prevent server overloads by blocking an excessive number of packets to be processed by the server that would ordinarily overload the server. It would further be desirable to block the excessive number of packets of data at the routers located on the server and client side of the network system. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The problems outlined above may at least in part be solved in some embodiments by a server sending a request to one or more routers located on the server side of a network system to block, i.e., filter, packets of data that may exceed the capacity of the server to service. The one or more routers located on the server side may block those packets of data and propagate the request to block those packets of data to one or more neighboring routers which may be located on the client side of the network system. The one or more neighboring routers on the client side of the network system may then block those packets of data that may exceed the capacity of the server to service and/or propagate the request to block those packets of data to their one or more neighboring routers which may be located near the client sending the excessive number of packets of data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, a method for preventing at least in part a server overload may comprise the step of a server detecting an excessive number of packets exceeding a predetermined limit that may cause an overload of the server. The server may then send a request to block the excessive number of packets to one or more of the one or more routers coupled to the server that have a privilege relationship with the server. A privilege relationship may refer to a logical secure connection between the router and the server as indicated in the configuration file in the router and/or in the server. One or more of the routers coupled to the server with a privilege relationship with the server may block the excessive number of packets for a first period of time as well as propagate the request to their one or more neighboring routers which may be located on the client side of the network system. One or more of the one or more neighboring routers may block the excessive number of packets for a second period of time if their configuration file indicates to honor the request to block the excessive number of packets. It is noted that the second period of time during which one or more of the one or more neighboring routers may block the excessive number of packets is less than the first period of time during which one or more of the one or more routers coupled to the server that have a privilege relationship with the server may block the excessive number of packets. Furthermore, one or more of the one or more neighboring routers may propagate the request to their one or more neighboring routers if their configuration file indicates to propagate the request. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>&mdash;Network System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of the present invention of a network system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Network system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may comprise one or more clients <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>A-C connected to a web server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> via the Internet <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The Internet <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may refer to a network of computers. Network system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may further comprise a plurality of routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A-D configured to forward packets of data where one or more of the plurality of routers, e.g., <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A, are coupled to server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The one or more routers, e.g., <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A, that are coupled to server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are commonly referred to as &ldquo;server-side&rdquo; routers. One or more of the plurality of routers, e.g., <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B-D, may be coupled to one or more clients <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>A-C which are configured to forward packets of information from the one or more clients <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>A-C to server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The one or more routers, e.g., <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B-D, that are coupled to one or more clients <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>A-C are commonly referred to as &ldquo;client-side&rdquo; routers. Clients <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>A-C may collectively or individually be referred to as clients <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> or client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, respectively. Routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A-D may collectively or individually be referred to as routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, respectively. It is noted that network system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may comprise any number of clients <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> as well as any number of routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is illustrative. It is further noted that server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be coupled to any number of routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. It is further noted that the connection between clients <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and the Internet <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be any medium type, e.g., wireless, wired. It is further noted that client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> may be any type of device, e.g., wireless, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), cell phone, personal computer system, workstation, Internet appliance, configured with the capability of connecting to the Internet <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and consequently communicating with web server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. It is further noted that network system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be any type of system that has at least one server, at least one router and at least one client and that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is not to be limited in scope to any one particular embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>A-C may comprise a web browser <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>A-C, respectively, which may be configured for communicating with the Internet <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and for reading and executing web pages. Browsers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>A-C may collectively or individually be referred to as browsers <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> or browser <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, respectively. While the illustrated client engine is a web browser <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, those skilled in the art will recognize that other client engines may be used in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Web server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may comprise a web page engine <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for maintaining and providing access to an Internet web page which is enabled to forward static web pages as well as web pages dynamically created by servlets <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> to web browser <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. A servlet may be a program typically written in the Java object-oriented programming language. Servlets <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> typically are server-side applications (often implemented using the Java&trade; programming language) that may be used to create web pages that contain dynamic or run-time information. Server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> then delivers the page to client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, for example via the Internet <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As stated in the Background Information section, clients may communicate with the web server by sending a number of packets in a given time interval through one or more routers for the server to process. If the number of packets that need to be serviced in a given time exceeds the capability of the web server, the server may crash due to an excessive load. A server crash is at the very least annoying, and may result in serious or irreparable damage. While the server is inoperative, clients coupled to the server may no longer have the ability to communicate with the server. It would therefore be desirable to at least in part prevent server overloads by blocking an excessive number of packets to be processed by the server that would ordinarily overload the server. It would further be desirable to block the excessive number of packets of data at the routers located on the server and client side of the network system. In one embodiment, an excessive number of packets of data may be blocked, i.e., filtered, by routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> on the server side as well as on the client side as discussed in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Configurations of server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> are discussed below in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the present invention of server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may comprise a central processing unit (CPU) <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> coupled to various other components by system bus <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. An operating system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> runs on CPU <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and provides control and coordinates the function of the various components of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Application <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, e.g., program for at least in part preventing an overload of server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, as described in steps <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, runs in conjunction with operating system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> which implements the various functions to be performed by application <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. Read only memory (ROM) <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is coupled to system bus <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and includes a basic input/output system (&ldquo;BIOS&rdquo;) that controls certain basic functions of server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Random access memory (RAM) <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, disk adapter <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> and communications adapter <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> are also coupled to system bus <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that software components including operating system <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and application <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> are loaded into RAM <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> which is the computer system&apos;s main memory. Disk adapter <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> may be a small computer system interface (&ldquo;SCSI&rdquo;) adapter that communicates with disk units <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, e.g., disk drive. It is noted that the program of the present invention that may at least in part prevent an overload of server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, as described in steps <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, may reside in disk unit <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> or in application <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>. It is further noted that disk units <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, e.g., disk drive, may comprise a configuration file as will be discussed in greater detail in the discussion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. It is further noted that the configuration file may be stored in any non-volatile memory. Communications adapter <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> interconnects bus <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> with router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> enabling server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to communicate with router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Implementations of the invention include implementations as a computer system programmed to execute the method or methods described herein, and as a computer program product. According to the computer system implementations, sets of instructions for executing the method or methods are resident in the random access memory <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> of one or more computer systems configured generally as described above. Until required by server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, the set of instructions may be stored as a computer program product in another computer memory, for example, in disk drive <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (which may include a removable memory such as an optical disk or floppy disk for eventual use in disk drive <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>). Furthermore, the computer program product can also be stored at another computer and transmitted when desired to the user&apos;s workstation by a network or by an external network such as the Internet. One skilled in the art would appreciate that the physical storage of the sets of instructions physically changes the medium upon which it is stored so that the medium carries computer readable information. The change may be electrical, magnetic, chemical or some other physical change. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>&mdash;Method for Preventing at Least in Part a Server Overload </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a flowchart of one embodiment of the present invention of a method <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> for preventing at least in part an overload of server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. As stated in the Background Information section, clients may communicate with the web server by sending a number of packets in a given time interval through one or more routers for the server to process. If the number of packets that need to be serviced in a given time exceeds the capability of the web server, the server may crash due to an excessive load. A server crash is at the very least annoying, and may result in serious or irreparable damage. While the server is inoperative, clients coupled to the server may no longer have the ability to communicate with the server. It would therefore be desirable to at least in part prevent server overloads by blocking an excessive number of packets to be processed by the server that would ordinarily overload the server. It would further be desirable to block, i.e., filter, the excessive number of packets of data at the routers located on the server and client side of the network system thereby preventing at least in part an overload of server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Method <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is a method for blocking, i.e., filtering, the excessive number of packets of data by routers located on the server side as well as on the client side. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>501</bold></highlight>, server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may receive packets of data to be serviced from clients <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be configured to continuously count the number of packets sent from each client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> during a particular time frame, e.g., two seconds. In one embodiment, a counter implemented in software in server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be configured to continuously count the number of packets sent from each client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> during a particular time frame, e.g., two seconds. In one embodiment, the number of packets counted during a particular time frame may be continuously tracked in a configuration file as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the present invention of a configuration file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, configuration file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> may comprise the number of packets received by a particular client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> as identified by the source Internet Protocol (IP) address of the particular client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> during a particular period of time, e.g., two seconds, that may be continuously updated as more packets are received from that particular client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may detect an excessive number of packets exceeding a predetermined limit that may cause an overload of server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. As stated above, server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be configured to count the number of packets sent from a particular client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> during a particular time frame. Server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may further be configured to extract particular information, e.g., Internet Protocol (IP) destination address, destination port of server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, that may reside in the packet header field of the packets sent from a particular client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>. Server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may further be configured to determine if the number of packets received during a particular time frame exceeds a predetermined limit. In one embodiment, the number of packets allowed to be received from a particular client in a particular time frame may be established by a system administrator in configuration file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, configuration file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> may further comprise information such as the source Internet Protocol (IP) address of particular clients <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, the number of packets received from those particular clients <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> during a particular time frame, the port in server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to receive packets sent from those particular clients <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, as well as actions server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may perform if the number of packets received from those clients <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> during a particular time frame exceeds the predetermined limit as established by a system administrator. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may block, i.e., filter, (as indicated by &ldquo;BLOCK&rdquo; in configuration file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>) packets received during a particular time frame that exceed the predetermined limit. Furthermore, server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may inform the system administrator (as indicated by &ldquo;INF_ADM&rdquo;) when server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> receives a number of packets during a particular time frame that exceed the predetermined limit. It is noted that configuration file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> may reside in disk unit <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. It is further noted that configuration file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> may reside in any non-volatile memory. It is further noted that configuration file <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> may comprise other information and that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is illustrative. Additional details regarding server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> detecting an excessive number of packets exceeding a predetermined limit are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. ______ filed on May 31, 2001, entitled &ldquo;System and Method for Extending Server Security Through Monitored Load Management,&rdquo; Attorney Docket No. AUS920010361US1, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight>, server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may send a request to one or more of the one or more routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> coupled to server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> that have a privilege relationship with server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. A privilege relationship may refer to a logical secured connection between router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may store a list of routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that have a privilege relationship with server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in a file that may reside in disk unit <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the request may be a request to block, i.e., filter, an excessive number of packets of data sent by a particular client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The request may be sent to one or more of the one or more routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> coupled to server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> in order to block the excessive number of packets closer to the client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> requesting an excessive number of packets to be serviced by server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, each of the one or more routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, e.g., routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A, that receives the request from server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may determine whether or not to block, i.e., filter, particular packets as identified in the request for a first period of time, e.g., 100 milliseconds. In one embodiment, each of the one or more routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, e.g., routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A, that receives the request in step <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> may determine whether or not to block particular packets as identified in the request based on their configuration file as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates an embodiment of the present invention of a configuration file <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, configuration file <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> may comprise information as to whether or not to honor the request, i.e., block request, if sent from a particular server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Configuration file <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> may comprise row entries of different servers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and a column entry as to whether or not to honor a block request sent from those particular servers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. For example, if &ldquo;server 1&rdquo; in configuration file <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> corresponded to server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, then the router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> coupled to server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, e.g., router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A, with configuration file <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> may honor the block request sent from server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. That is, the router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> coupled to server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, e.g., router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A, would block the packets identified in the request. The particular packets to block may be identified by one or more of the following information included in the request: Internet Protocol address of client <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, Internet Protocol address of server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and port of server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to receive packets. It is noted that the request sent by server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to one or more of the one or more routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> coupled to server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> that have a privilege relationship with server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may comprise the first period of time, e.g., 100 milliseconds. As stated above, the first period of time, e.g., 100 milliseconds, may be the time that particular packets as identified in the request sent by server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are blocked. In another embodiment, the first period of time may be determined by routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with a privilege relationship with server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> deducting the time accrued in the transfer of the request identified in step <highlight><bold>503</bold></highlight> from server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as well as the time accrued in processing that request from the period of time identified in the request. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, each of the one or more neighboring routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, e.g., routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B-D, that receives the request in step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> may determine whether or not to propagate the request to its one or more neighboring routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, configuration file <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> may further comprise information as to whether or not to propagate the request, i.e., block request, to its neighboring one or more routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> if sent from particular routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>.

For example, if &ldquo;router 1&rdquo; in configuration file <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> corresponded to router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A, then the neighboring router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, e.g., router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>C, with configuration file <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> may propagate the request to its neighboring one or more routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. It is noted that configuration file <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> may comprise other information and that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is illustrative. For example, configuration file <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> may comprise information as to whether or not to propagate the request to a particular neighboring router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> if the request is received from a different router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> If configuration file <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> indicates to propagate the block request, then the particular neighboring router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, e.g., router <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>C, propagates the blocks request to its one or more neighboring routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>515</bold></highlight>. The one or more neighboring routers <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that received the block request may then determine whether or not to block, i.e., filter, particular packets as identified in the request, i.e., block request, in step <highlight><bold>511</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
