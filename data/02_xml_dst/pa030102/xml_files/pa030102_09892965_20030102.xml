<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to an award redemption program. More particularly, the present invention relates to a corporate rewards program that provides a user with a method to use awards or points, which have not been earned at the time of their use. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Today&apos;s consumers, and in particular, frequent business travelers well understand the proliferation of corporate rewards programs. The programs are designed to engender brand loyalty to hotels, airlines, and other businesses. The programs offer points of various kinds, such as frequent flyer miles, which can be earned by various purchases, and then redeemed for goods or services upon reaching certain predetermined or predefined plateaus. Such rewards as free flights, free hotel stays and reduced rate car rentals are commonly available after the accumulation of a prescribed amount or level of points, or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One example of a frequency and award redemption program is illustrated by the travel industry to promote customer loyalty. Such programs are commonly known as a &ldquo;frequent flyer&rdquo; program. In such a program, when the customer books a flight, a certain amount of &ldquo;mileage points&rdquo; are awarded to the customer. In the travel industry the number of points earned is typically calculated by using a formula employing the distance traveled as a parameter. However, the points are not awarded until the traveler actually takes the flight and are not usable until after the points are accumulated at certain predefined levels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When the customer has accumulated a sufficient number of points, those points may be redeemed for an award chosen from a specific list specified by the program. Thus, in the example given above of a frequent flyer program, a customer may redeem points earned for purchasing and taking flights for free flight tickets or a rental car etc. The customer generally needs to request a certificate, and use the issued certificate as payment for the free travel. While the rewarding of points may induce customer loyalty to an extent, there is an inherent amount of time between earning of the points and the ability of the customer to use the points. Also, during the time the customer has insufficient points to qualify for an award there is little incentive for the customer to continue using the company that issued the points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it would be desirable to achieve a strategy to permit customers to use awarded points or the like, in a manner that is most useful to the customer, while at the same time, providing motivation for the customer to remain loyal to the company that awarded the points. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the invention provides a method of providing awards to a customer including receiving an award request, determining if the customer has a number of points to meet a predetermined number of points corresponding to the award request and authorizing a points overdraft if the customer has less than the predetermined number of points. </paragraph>

The overdraft request may include a request from a user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to debit the user reward or points account. The overdraft request may include a selection of a reward of a user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, for example, a specific flight, or a specific good or service from the company <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may include a program for generating and tracking a time interval based on the date of the overdraft request. The server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may also include a program to determine and apply to the user account a penalty, payment or other disincentive, in the event the user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> does not generate enough points to replenish the user awards point account or repay the overdraft in the specified or predetermined time interval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the time interval for repayment or replenishing of the awards points, or the like, can be any time interval specified by the company. In one embodiment, the time interval can be 30 days. In other embodiments, the time interval can be one week or about one year. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the award may be in any suitable form, such as, for example, mileage, rental car privileges, goods, services, cash, vacations, and other awards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> User <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, through Internet <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, may also be connected to an associated company server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The associated company server <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be included to provide or share information regarding an award originating from the primary company <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to a user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, where the award is in the form of goods and/or services provided by the secondary or associated company <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. In other words, the user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may qualify for an award from, for example, an airline. The award may be in the form of &ldquo;flyer miles&rdquo; as is customary, which is provided by the airline. However, frequently, an airline may provide awards that are not in the form of air mileage but a related award such as use of a rental car or hotel room. In this case, the user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may qualify for an award and may use the reward to access and obtain use of a rental car or hotel from the secondary or associated company through server site <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It will be understood that the above example is illustrative and not restrictive in nature. Thus, the primary company <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and secondary company <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which may be a plurality of companies and which may or may not have cooperative agreements to offer and provide awards.

The connection from user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to company system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and company system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be an Internet connection or any suitable connection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, one embodiment of a method for providing awards to a customer is illustrated. After a user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has made a purchase of goods and/or services from a company <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, awards points may be generated. The points may be stored in a company computer or server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or any suitable system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> At some point, the user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may present the company <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> with a request to exchange rewards points for goods and/or services (Block <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>). It will be understood that the rewards may or may not be related to company goods and/or services. In one embodiment, the awards are goods and/or services provided by a secondary or associated company. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> After the request is received, a determination may be made whether there are enough points in the account to provide the award to the user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (Block <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>). In the event that there are enough points to provide the award to the customer or user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the award is provided in the conventional fashion and the account debited accordingly (Block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the event that there are not enough points in the account of the user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a process is initiated to authorize an overdraft of the account (Block <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>). The process of authorizing an overdraft of the user account may include accessing a database or otherwise determining at least one of a set of customer criteria. The company may use the customer criteria to determine whether or not to authorize the rewards overdraft. The customer criteria may include but is not limited to an authorization to debit a financial instrument such as, for example, a customer credit or debit card, access to a customer bank account, the frequency which the customer patronizes the company <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, historical repayments or replenishing of award point overdrafts and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The process may include determining whether the user has provided a credit or debit card or access to other financial instruments or accounts, for example, a savings or checking account and an authorization to debit the instrument or bank account in the event that the user cannot timely fulfill the terms of an overdraft portion of the company awards agreement, i.e., purchase enough goods and/or services to replenish the account award points. It will be understood that other suitable checks may be included in the authorization process to determine whether the user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may qualify for the overdraft to the user account, for example, a credit check of the user or customer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> After the overdraft authorization has been approved or granted, a predetermined time period may be provided for the user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to replenish the awards account (Block <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>). The time period may be any suitable time period. In one embodiment, the time period may be 30 days. In other embodiments, the time period may be one, two, three or more months. In the predetermined time period the user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may earn enough points or the like to meet or exceed the overdraft or debit of the awards account. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> After the predetermined time period has expired, in one embodiment, the company server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> makes a determination, whether the user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has made sufficient purchases of goods and/or services to earn points and replenish the user account (Block <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>). In the event that the user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has earned sufficient points in the predetermined time period to replenish the user account no penalty is accessed. In one embodiment, the notification of the debt repayment may be sent to the consumer <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> when such replenishment is accomplished. The notification may be in e-mail form, a telephone call, a mailing or any suitable notification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the event that the user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has not replenished the points in the user account, a financial penalty is imposed on the user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (Block <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>). The penalty may be in the form of a monetary debit to the user credit or debit card or bank account, for example. The amount of the penalty may be the full or discounted price of the awarded goods and/or services. The penalty may be the imposition of an interest charge against the full or reduced price of the awarded goods and/or services. Other suitable financial compensation is contemplated as being assessed against the user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in the event that award points are not earned by the termination of the time period. In this manner, the user <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is encouraged to continue earning awards points by purchasing goods and services from the primary company <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> While the embodiments of the invention disclosed herein are presently considered to be preferred, various changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The scope of the invention is indicated in the appended claims, and all changes that come within the meaning and range of equivalents are intended to be embraced therein. </paragraph>
