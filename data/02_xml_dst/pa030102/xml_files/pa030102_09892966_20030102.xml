<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of groupware applications, and more particularly to a groupware application that allows changes to a shared document by each user to be viewed relative to the original version of the shared document within a single object. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a network system, one or more clients may be coupled to a server where the server may store one or more applications shared by one or more users, i.e., the one or more users of the one or more clients. An application shared by one or more users may commonly be referred to as a groupware application. Subsequently, a groupware application may allow multiple users to be simultaneously active within the single groupware application. In this manner, several users may simultaneously utilize documents in the groupware application. Typically, a document may be passed along to users through groupware code, e.g., Lotus&trade;. When the document is edited by one of the users who have access to the document, it may be saved by that particular user under the current version. When that particular user saves the edited document under the current version, the previous changes made by other user(s) may be lost. Subsequently, that particular user may save the edited document under a new version thereby preserving the previous changes made by other user(s) in a previous version. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> When a user desires to compare the differences in one version versus another version of a particular document, the user may use an application, e.g., Compare Rite, that highlights the changes made between the two versions. A new document may subsequently be created by the application, e.g., Compare Rite, indicating which words were added and deleted in one of the two versions with respect to the other version of the document. Unfortunately, a version of the document embodying changes made by one or more users may not be viewed concurrently with the original version of the document in a single object thereby allowing a user to visually compare and contrast the changes made by one or more users. That is, a version of the document embodying changes made by one or more users may not be viewed concurrently with the original version of the document in the same window such as on a computer screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It would therefore be desirable to develop a groupware application that allows changes to a shared document by each user to be viewed relative to the original version of the shared document within a single object. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The problems outlined above may at least in part be solved in some embodiments by providing one or more on-screen symbols, e.g., icons, in conjunction with the original version of the shared document in a single object. The one or more on-screen symbols may be associated with one or more users who made changes to the original document. By selecting one of the one or more on-screen symbols, a menu may appear with one or more versions of the original document written by the user associated with the on-screen symbol. Upon selecting a particular version, at least a section of the original document may appear with highlighted changes that indicate the changes made to the original document in the selected version. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, a method for viewing changes to a shared document in a single object may comprise the step of opening a shared document by a first particular user. Upon opening the shared document, the original document with one or more on-screen symbols, e.g., icons, may be displayed on the display of the first particular user. The one or more on-screen symbols may indicate one or more users who have saved changes to the original document. A determination may be made as to whether to view the changes made to the original document by the first particular user or a second particular user. If the first particular user wants to view the changes made to the original document by either the first particular user or the second particular user then the first particular user selects the on-screen symbol associated with that particular user. Upon selecting the on-screen symbol, a menu may appear with one or more versions of the original document written by the user associated with the on-screen symbol. Upon selecting a particular version, at least a section of the original document may appear with highlighted changes that indicate the changes made to the original document in the selected version. In one embodiment, the section of the original document that appears may be the section indicating the first of the changes to the original document. A button may appear providing the first particular user an option to proceed to the next one or more changes in the original document. In one embodiment, at least one section of the original document may be displayed in parallel with the corresponding section in the version selected where the original document includes highlighted changes. In another embodiment, at least one section of the original document may be displayed with word(s) highlighted where the word(s) highlighted indicate the words in the original document that were changed in the selected version. The first particular user may select the highlighted word(s) to view the changes made to the highlighted word(s) in the selected version. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The first particular user may then decide to edit the selected version. In one embodiment, the first particular user may view the selected version by re-selecting the on-screen symbol associated with the selected version. Upon editing the selected version, the first particular user may attempt to save the changes made to the selected version. A determination may then be made as to whether the first particular user has an on-screen symbol associated with the original document. If the first particular user does not have an on-screen symbol associated with the original document then an onscreen symbol is created. When an on-screen symbol is created, an additional onscreen symbol associated with another particular user may be added to the list of one or more on-screen symbols appearing on the display. Once the determination step of determining whether the first particular user has an on-screen symbol associated with the original document is completed, the changes made in the version selected that result in changes made with respect to the original document may be saved in a file. That is, only the changes made with respect to the original document may be saved in a file even though the changes are made in a particular version that includes changes made to the original document. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> If the first particular user decided not to view the changes made to the original document, then the first particular user may decide to edit the original document. Upon editing the original document, the first particular user may attempt to save the changes made to the original document. A determination may then be made as to whether the first particular user does has an on-screen symbol associated with the original document. If the first particular user does not have an on-screen symbol associated with the original document then an on-screen symbol is created. When an on-screen symbol is created, an additional on-screen symbol associated with another particular user may be added to the list of one or more on-screen symbols appearing on the display. Once the determination step of determining whether the first particular user has an on-screen symbol associated with the original document is completed, the changes made in the original document may be saved in a file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the invention. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention comprises a system, computer program product and method for viewing changes to a shared document in a single object. While the following discusses the present invention in conjunction with an application, the present invention may be implemented in a word processing tool, built-in editor or any tool that allows the user to create an on-screen symbol thereby allowing the user to view the original document with changes made to the original document within a single object. Furthermore, while the following discusses the present invention in conjunction with viewing textual changes, the present invention may be expanded to include viewing graphical changes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>&mdash;Network System </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates one embodiment of the present invention of a network system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Network system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may comprise one or more clients <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A-C coupled to a server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Clients <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A-C may be configured to send requests to server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be configured to supply information to the one or more clients <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A-C. Clients <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A-C may collectively or individually be referred to as clients <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> or client <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, respectively. It is noted that network system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may comprise any number of clients <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> as well as any number of servers <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is illustrative. It is further noted that the connection between clients <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may be any medium type, e.g., wireless, wired. It is further noted that client <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be any type of device, e.g., wireless, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), cell phone, personal computer system, workstation, Internet appliance, configured with the capability of connecting to the Internet and consequently communicating with server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. It is further noted that network system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be any type of system that has at least one server and at least one client and that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is not to be limited in scope to any one particular embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>&mdash;Client </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a typical hardware configuration of client <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> which is representative of a hardware environment for practicing the present invention. Client <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> has a central processing unit (CPU) <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> coupled to various other components by system bus <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. An operating system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> runs on CPU <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and provides control and coordinates the function of the various components of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. An application <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, e.g., program for allowing changes to a shared document by each user to be viewed relative to the original version of the shared document within a single object, as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, runs in conjunction with operating system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and provides output calls to operating system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> which implements the various functions or services to be performed by application <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Read only memory (ROM) <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is coupled to system bus <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> and includes a basic input/output system (&ldquo;BIOS&rdquo;) that controls certain basic functions of client <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Random access memory (RAM) <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, I/O adapter <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>, and communications adapter <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> are also coupled to system bus <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that software components including operating system <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and application <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are loaded into RAM <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> which is the computer system&apos;s main memory. I/O adapter <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> may be an integrated drive electronics (&ldquo;IDE&rdquo;) adapter that communicates with disk unit <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, e.g., disk drive. It is noted that the program of the present invention that allows changes to a shared document by each user to be viewed relative to the original version of the shared document within a single object, as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, may reside in disk unit <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> or in application <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Communications adapter <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> interconnects bus <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> with an outside network enabling client <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to communicate with other such systems via a Local Area Network (LAN), e.g., Ethernet, Token Ring, ARCnet, or a Wide Area Network (WAN), e.g., Internet. Input/Output devices are also connected to system bus <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> via a user interface adapter <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and display adapter <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. Keyboard <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, mouse <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and speaker <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> are all interconnected to bus <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> through user interface adapter <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. Event data may be input to client <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through any of these devices. A display monitor <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> is connected to system bus <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> by display adapter <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. In this manner, a user is capable of inputting to client <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through keyboard <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> or mouse <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> and receiving output from client <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> via display <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> or speaker <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Implementations of the invention include implementations as a computer system programmed to execute the method or methods described herein, and as a computer program product. According to the computer system implementation, sets of instructions for executing the method or methods are resident in the random access memory <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> of one or more computer systems configured generally as described above. Until required by the computer system, the set of instructions may be stored as a computer program product in another computer memory, for example, in disk drive <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (which may include a removable memory such as an optical disk or floppy disk for eventual use in the disk drive <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>). Further, the computer program product can also be stored at another computer and transmitted when desired to the user&apos;s work station by a network or by an external network such as the Internet. One skilled in the art would appreciate that the physical storage of the sets of instructions physically changes the medium upon which it is stored so that the medium carries computer readable information. The change may be electrical, magnetic, chemical, biological, or some other physical change. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flowchart of one embodiment of the present invention of a method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for allowing changes to a shared document by each user to be viewed relative to the original version of the shared document within a single object. As stated in the Background Information section, a version of the document embodying changes made by one or more users may not be viewed concurrently with the original version of the document in a single object thereby allowing a user to visually compare and contrast the changes made by one or more users. That is, a version of the document embodying changes made by one or more users may not be viewed concurrently with the original version of the document in the same window such as on a computer screen. It would therefore be desirable to develop a groupware application that allows changes to a shared document by each user to be viewed relative to the original version of the shared document within a single object. Method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is a method for allowing changes to a shared document by each user to be viewed relative to the original version of the shared document within a single object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, a particular user of one of the one or more clients <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> coupled to server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may execute a particular groupware application, i.e., an application shared among the one or more clients <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, stored on server <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, a particular document in the particular groupware application may be executed to be opened by the particular user. In step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, the particular user may enter a user identification, e.g., user ID, password, in response to a prompt issued by the groupware application. In step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, a determination may be made as to whether the particular user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> has permission to view the document executed to be opened in step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. If the particular user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> does not have permission to view the document executed to be opened in step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> then method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is terminated in step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> If the particular user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> has permission to view the document executed to be opened in step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, then the particular user may view the document in step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. When the particular user views the document, the particular user may view on display <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> at least a section of the original document with one or more on-screen symbols, e.g., icons, indicating one or more users who have saved changes to the original document as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is an illustration of an object with at least a section of the original document along with one or more on-screen symbols, e.g., icons, indicating one or more users who have saved changes to the original document in accordance with the present invention. Each on-screen symbol may be representative of one or more versions of the original document generated by the particular user associated with the on-screen symbol as described further below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A determination may then be made as to whether to view the changes made to the original document by a particular user, including the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, in step <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>. If the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> wants to view changes made to the original document by a particular user, including the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, then the user selects the on-screen symbol associated with that particular user in step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. For example, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, if the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> wants to view changes made to the original document by Smith then the user selects the on-screen symbol, e.g., icon, entitled &ldquo;Smith.&rdquo; In one embodiment, when the on-screen symbol is selected a pop-up menu may be displayed on display <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> in step <highlight><bold>309</bold></highlight>. The pop-up menu may display one or more versions of the original document written by the user associated with the on-screen symbol selected in step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, the user may select a particular version of the original document where the version comprises information regarding the changes made with respect to the original document. Upon selection of a particular version, the user, in step <highlight><bold>311</bold></highlight>, may view on display <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> at least a section of the original document with highlighted changes that indicate the changes made by the particular user associated with the on-screen symbol, e.g., icon, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates the changes made by a particular user with respect to an original document in accordance with the present invention. As further illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the on-screen symbol, e.g., icon, associated with the particular user whose changes are highlighted on display <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> may change form, This is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> by the dotted shading and the corresponding bold face font. It is noted that the changes made to the original document may be illustrated in other forms not exemplified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and that <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is illustrative. It is further noted that in one embodiment, the section of the original document with highlighted changes displayed on display <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> may be the section indicating the first of the changes of the original document. The user as identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> may be provided with an option to proceed to the next one or more changes in the original document. For example, a button may appear on display <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> providing the user as identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> with an option to proceed to the next one or more changes in the original document. It is further noted that in one embodiment, the original document may be displayed while overlying the original document with changes made with respect to the original document as stored in a file associated with the selected version. Each version may have a file associated with it storing the words changed with respect to the original document including instructions as to where the words are to be placed in the original document. In one embodiment, the file associated with the selected version may be appended to the file storing the original document. In one embodiment, at least one section of the original document may be displayed on display <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> in parallel with the corresponding section in the version selected where the original document includes highlighted changes. In another embodiment, at least one section of the original document may be displayed with word(s) highlighted where the word(s) highlighted indicate the words in the original document that were changed in the selected version. The user may then select the highlighted word(s) to view the changes made to the highlighted word(s) in the selected version. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> a determination may be made as to whether the version selected is to be edited by the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. If the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is not to edit the version selected then method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is terminated in step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. If the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is to edit the version selected then the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> edits the version selected in step <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> may view the selected version by re-selecting the on-screen symbol associated with the selected version. Upon viewing the selected version, the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> may edit the selected version in step <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. Upon the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> attempting to save the changes made to the version selected, a determination may be made in step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> as to whether the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> has a save button, i.e., an on-screen symbol associated with the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. If the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> does not have an on-screen symbol indicating changes made to the original document then an on-screen symbol associated with the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is created in step <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. When an on-screen symbol is created, an additional on-screen symbol associated with another particular user may be added to the list of one or more on-screen symbols, e.g., icons, on display <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. Once the step of determining whether the first particular user has an on-screen symbol associated with the original document is completed, the changes made in the version selected that resulted in changes made with respect to the original document may be saved in a file in step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. That is, only the changes made with respect to the original document may be saved in a file even though the changes are made in a particular version that includes changes made to the original document. The file may include instructions as to where the changed words are located in the original document. By saving only the changes made with respect to the original document, changes made to the original document by one or more users may be viewed in a single object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to step <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, if the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> does not want to view the changes made to the original document by a particular user, including the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, then a determination may be made in step <highlight><bold>317</bold></highlight> as to whether the original document viewed is to be edited by the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. If the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is not to edit the original document viewed then method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is terminated in step <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. If the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is to edit the original document viewed then the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> edits the original document viewed in step <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. Upon the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> attempting to save the changes made to the original document viewed, a determination may be made in step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> as to whether the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> has a save button, i.e., an on-screen symbol associated with the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>. If the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> does not have an on-screen symbol indicating changes made to the original document then an on-screen symbol associated with the user identified in step <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is created in step <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight>. Once the step of determining whether the first particular user has an on-screen symbol associated with the original document is completed, the changes made to the original document may be saved in a file in step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>. By saving only the changes made with respect to the original document, changes made to the original document by one or more users may be viewed in a single object. </paragraph>
