<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system and method for severing a portion of a wrapping film for facilitating the detachment and attachment of trailing and leading end portions of the wrapping film from and onto loads disposed at a wrapping station in conjunction with film wrapping operations being performed upon loads being wrapped at a wrapping station comprises an actuating arm movable between retracted and extended positions and upon which a fixed clamping member and a movable clamping member are mounted such that the movable clamping member can move toward and away from the fixed clamping member so as to define therewith CLOSED and OPENED positions. Upon termination of a wrapping operation, the actuating arm is moved from its retracted position to its extended position, the clamping members are moved to their CLOSED position so as to clamp a portion of the wrapping film therebetween, and a hot-wire cutter is energized so as to sever a portion of the clamped film. A trailing end portion of the wrapping film is thus released for self-adherence to the wrapped load, while a leading end portion of the wrapping film is maintained clamped between the clamping members in preparation for self-adherence to a new load to be wrapped. When wrapping of the new load is commenced, the movable clamping member is moved to its OPENED position such that the clamped leading end portion of the wrapping film is released for self-adherence to the new load to be wrapped, and the actuating arm is returned to its retracted position. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to article, load, or package wrapping machines, apparatus, or systems, and more particularly to a new and improved mechanism or system which is to be utilized in conjunction with such article, load, or package wrapping machines, apparatus, or systems whereby in effect the attachment of the leading edge portion of the wrapping film to the article, load, or package at the commencement of an article, load, or package wrapping cycle, as well as the detachment or severance of the trailing edge portion of the wrapping film from the article, load, or package at the termination of the article, load, or package wrapping cycle, can be achieved in a semiautomatic manner obviating the need for operator personnel to physically, personally, or manually attach or sever the leading and trailing edge portions of the wrapping film to or from the article, load, or package, respectively. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Article, load, or package wrapping machines, apparatus, or systems for wrapping articles, loads, or packages within a suitable wrapping film are of course well-known. In accordance with such article, load, or package wrapping machines, apparatus, or systems, a roll of packaging film is normally mounted upon a film roll carriage, and the film roll carriage is movably mounted, for example, upon an upstanding mast or track member, such that the film roll carriage, having the roll of wrapping film mounted thereon, can be vertically moved between uppermost and lowermost positions while also undergoing relative rotatable movement with respect to the article, load, or package. In this manner, spiral wrapping of the film upon the article, load, or package is able to be achieved in a well-known manner. In order to minimize article, load, or package wrapping cycle time, and therefore maximize article, load, or package wrapping production, that is, the number of articles, loads, or packages that can be wrapped or packaged within a predetermined period of time, it is desirable to, in effect, automate the article, load, or package wrapping cycle as much as possible. One operative part or section of such article, load, or package wrapping cycle in which strides have sought to have been made in order to enhance the automation of the wrapping cycle resides in the attachment or securing, and the detachment or severing, of the end portions of the wrapping film onto and from the particular article, load, or package being wrapped. An automated system of this type is disclosed, for example, within U.S. Pat. No. 5,572,850 which issued to Lancaster, III et al. on Nov. 12, 1996. In accordance with the operative system disclosed within such patent, in order to sever or separate a trailing end portion of the wrapping film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which is already wrapped around a load <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, a puncturing device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> having a plurality of sharp pins <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is activated such that the sharp pins <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> puncture the trailing end portion of the wrapping film in order to effectively weaken the same. The film delivery or dispensing drive motor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is no longer driven, however, the turntable <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, upon which the packaged or wrapped load is disposed, continues to rotate. Consequently, the weakened film is tensioned and stretched, the holes or perforations increase in size, and eventually, the film tears at the weakened sites defined by the punctured holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> While the aforenoted system is quite satisfactory and has been commercially successful, the system exhibits several operational drawbacks or disadvantages. Firstly, the system is relatively costly and complex. For example, as disclosed within the noted patent, in order to achieve the proper operation of the system, at least three different timer devices or mechanisms must be incorporated or implemented into the system. In particular, a first timer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is required in order to decelerate the film delivery drive motor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and turntable <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in preparation for the initiation of the hole puncturing operation to be performed upon the trailing end portion of the wrapping or packaging film, a second timer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is required for controlling the solenoid <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> in order to in turn control the actuation of the puncturing device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and a third timer <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is required for controlling the termination of the film delivery drive motor <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> such that the aforenoted tensioning and stretching of the punctured wrapping or packaging film occurs in order to achieve the torn separation of the trailing edge portion of the wrapping or packaging film from the roll of wrapping or packaging film. Secondly, while the semi-automatic wrapping apparatus or system disclosed within the aforenoted patent is utilized to detach, terminate, or sever the trailing end portion of the wrapping or packaging film from the roll of wrapping or packaging film, there is no corresponding means or mechanism for securing, initiating, or attaching the leading end portion of the wrapping or packaging film to the article, load, or package to be wrapped or packaged in a semi-automatic operational mode. More particularly, in accordance with the disclosure of the aforenoted patent, in order to initiate a new wrapping or packaging cycle, an operator must grasp the free leading end portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the wrapping or packaging film, which is complementary to the trailing end portion of the wrapping or packaging film as formed by means of the aforenoted tearing or separating process facilitated by the puncturing, tensioning, and stretching of the film, and manually apply or secure such free leading end portion <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the wrapping or packaging film to the particular article, load, or package to be subsequently wrapped or packaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a need exists in the art for a new and improved mechanism or system which can be utilized in conjunction with article, load, or package wrapping apparatus, machines, or systems whereby in effect the attachment of the leading edge portion of the wrapping film to the article, load, or package at the commencement of an article, load, or package wrapping cycle, as well as the detachment or severance of the trailing edge portion of the wrapping film from the article, load, or package at the termination of the article, load, or package wrapping cycle, can be achieved in a semi-automatic manner obviating the need for operator personnel to physically, personally, or manually attach or sever the leading and trailing end portions of the wrapping film to or from the article, load, or package, respectively. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a new and improved mechanism or system which is to be utilized in conjunction with package, load, or article wrapping machines, apparatus, or systems for implementing the attachment or securement of a leading end portion of a wrapping or packaging film to an article, load, or package to be wrapped or packaged so as to prepare for the commencement of a film wrapping or packaging operation or cycle, as well as the detachment or severance of a trailing end portion of the wrapping or packaging film from the wrapped or packaged article, load, or package upon termination of the wrapping or packaging operation or cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved mechanism or system which is to be utilized in conjunction with package, load, or article wrapping machines, apparatus, or systems for implementing the attachment or securement of the leading end portion of the wrap-ping or packaging film to the article, load, or package to be wrapped or packaged so as to prepare for the commencement of the film wrapping or packaging operation or cycle, as well as the detachment or severance of the trailing end portion of the wrapping or packaging film from the wrapped or packaged article, load, or package upon termination of the wrapping or packaging operation or cycle, and which effectively overcomes the various operational drawbacks or disadavantages characteristic of the prior art systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> An additional object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved mechanism or system which is to be utilized in conjunction with package, load, or article wrapping machines, apparatus, or systems for implementing the attachment or securement of the leading end portion of the wrapping or packaging film to the package, load, or article to be wrapped or packaged so as to prepare for the commencement of the film wrapping or packaging operation or cycle, as well as the detachment or severance of the trailing end portion of the wrapping or packaging film from the wrapped or packaged article, load, or package upon termination of the wrapping or packaging operation or cycle, and which is relatively simple in structure and economical to produce. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A further object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved mechanism or system which is to be utilized in conjunction with package, load, or article wrapping machines, apparatus, or systems for implementing the attachment or securement of the leading edge portion of the wrapping film to the article, load, or package to be wrapped or packaged so as to prepare for the commencement of the film wrapping or packaging operation or wrapping cycle, as well as the detachment or severance of the trailing edge portion of the wrapping or packaging film from the package, load, or article upon termination of the article, load, or package wrapping or packaging operation or cycle, in a semiautomatic manner thereby obviating the need for operator personnel to physically, personally, or manually attach or sever the leading and trailing end portions of the wrapping film to or from the article, load, or package, respectively. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other objectives are achieved in accordance with the teachings and principles of the present invention through the provision of a new and improved mechanism or system which comprises a vertically upstanding stanchion or standard upon which a proximal end portion of an actuating arm is pivotally mounted. The actuating arm is pivotally movable between a first inoperative retracted position at which the actuating arm is disposed remote from the flow path of the wrapping or packaging film as the wrapping or packaging film is dispensed from the roll of wrapping or packaging film and wrapped around a load, article, or package disposed at a wrapping station, and a second operative extended position at which the actuating arm is disposed adjacent to the flow path of the wrapping or packaging film. A vertically oriented support plate is fixedly mounted upon a distal end portion of the actuating arm, and a first clamping plate is fixedly mounted upon an upper portion of the support plate. The first clamping plate has an electrically energizable cutting wire mounted thereon, and a second clamping plate is movably mounted upon the vertically oriented support plate. More particularly, the second clamping plate is movable between a first lowered inoperative position, and a second elevated operative position at which the second clamping plate is adapted to cooperate with the first clamping plate so as to clamp a portion of the wrapping or packaging film therebetween. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, when a wrapping or packaging operation or cycle is to be terminated, the actuating arm is moved from its first inoperative retracted position remote from the wrapping or packaging film flow path to its second operative extended position adjacent to the wrapping or packaging film flow path, and the second clamping plate is moved from its first lowered inoperative position to its second elevated operative position so as to cooperate with the first clamping plate and thereby clamp a portion of the wrapping or packaging film therebetween. At this time, the cutting wire is energized, and the clamped portion of the packaging or wrapping film is thereby severed. In this manner, the severed trailing end portion of the packaging or wrapping film extending from the packaged or wrapped article, load, or package is able to be secured to the packaged or wrapped article, load, or package, while the severed leading end portion of the packaging or wrapping film extending from the roll of wrapping or packaging film is held or maintained between the first and second clamping plates in preparation for the commencement of a new packaging or wrapping operation or cycle to be performed upon or in connection with a new article, load, or package to be wrapped or packaged when a new article, load, or package to be wrapped or packaged is conveyed to or deposited at the wrapping or packaging station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Subsequently, the actuating arm is moved or returned to its remote or retracted position with respect to the packaging or wrapping film flow path, and when a new article, load, or package to be wrapped or packaged has been conveyed to or deposited at the wrapping or packaging station, the actuating arm, still having the leading end portion of the wrapping or packaging film held or maintained between its clamping plates, is then moved again to its operative extended position adjacent to the packaging or wrapping film flow path. When a new packaging or wrapping operation or cycle has been partially commenced in connection with the new article, load, or package, the second lower clamping plate is moved downwardly away from the first upper clamping plate such that the leading end portion of the packaging or wrapping film held or maintained between the first and second clamping plates is now released, the new packaging or wrapping operation or cycle being performed upon or in connection with the new article, load, or package is continued, and the actuating arm is moved from its second operative extended position adjacent to the wrapping or packaging film flow path so as to again be returned to its first inoperative retracted position remote from the packaging or wrapping film flow path. When the new packaging or wrapping operation or cycle is to be terminated, the actuating arm will once again be moved from its first inoperative retracted position back to its second operative extended position adjacent to the wrapping or packaging film flow path in preparation for a clamping and severing operation whereby the operating cycles are cyclically repeated.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> thereof, a new and improved mechanism or system, which is to be utilized in conjunction with package, load, or article wrapping machines, apparatus, or systems for implementing the attachment or securement of a leading edge portion of the wrapping film to the article, load, or package to be wrapped or packaged so as to prepare for the commencement of the film wrapping or packaging operation or wrapping cycle, as well as the detachment or severance of a trailing edge portion of the wrapping or packaging film from the package, load, or article upon termination of the article, load, or package wrapping or packaging operation or cycle, in a semi-automatic manner so as to obviate the need for operator personnel to physically, personally, or manually attach or sever the leading and trailing end portions of the wrapping film to or from the article, load, or package, respectively, is disclosed and is generally indicated by the reference character <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. More particularly, the new and improved mechanism or system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is seen to comprise a base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> upon a first end of which there is fixedly mounted an upstanding support bracket <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The upstanding support bracket <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided with a pair of vertically spaced bracket lugs or ears <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for fixedly mounting a cylinder member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of an electrical linear actuator assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The electrical linear actuator assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is seen to further comprise an electrical linear actuator drive motor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is mounted upon a support block <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and the electrical linear actuator drive motor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is rotatably engaged with a rotatably driven member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which is also mounted upon the support block <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and which forms part of a combination rotary-rectilinear conversion drive unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The combination rotary-rectilinear conversion drive unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, in turn, includes a piston member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is operatively engaged with the rotatably driven member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> so as to be linearly movable interiorly of and with respect to the external cylinder member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in response to rotational movements of the rotatably driven member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In this manner, as the electrical linear actuator drive motor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is rotated in a first direction, rotatably driven member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is rotated in an opposite direction so as to, for example, cause the piston member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be linearly extended with respect to the cylinder member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, whereas when the electrical linear actuator drive motor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is rotated in a second direction, which is opposite to its first rotational or angular direction, rotatably driven member <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is rotated in a second opposite direction so as to, for example, cause the piston member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be linearly retracted with respect to the cylinder member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. It is further noted that the free end portion of the piston member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is integrally provided with a connector plate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and that the connector plate <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is adapted to be pivotally secured or attached to a lug or ear member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by means of a connector pin <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The lug or ear member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is fixedly mounted upon and projects radially outwardly from a lower end portion of a vertically extending externally splined shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The vertically extending externally splined shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is internally housed for rotational or angular movement within a vertically oriented stanchion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which is fixed at its lower end portion upon the base member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The upper end portion of the vertically extending externally splined shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> projects vertically outwardly from and above the upper end portion of the stanchion <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and in this manner, the upper end portion of the externally splined shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is adapted to be internally housed within and splinedly mated with an internally splined annular cap member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The internally splined cap member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is integrally formed upon a proximal end of a horizontally extending actuating arm <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, and the horizontally extending actuating arm <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is adapted to undergo pivotal movement in accordance with the double arrowhead CW-CCW around the vertical axis <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> defined by means of the upwardly extending externally splined shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> More particularly, it can be readily appreciated that when the electrical linear actuator assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is energized such that the piston member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is moved to its extended position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, actuating arm <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is rotated in the counterclockwise direction around vertical axis <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> as denoted by arrow CCW so as to be moved to its extended position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> through means of the pivotal or rotational movements of the lug or ear member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, upstanding externally splined shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and annular internally splined cap member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Conversely, when the electrical linear actuator assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is energized such that the piston member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is moved to its retracted position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, actuating arm <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is rotated in the clockwise direction around vertical axis <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> as denoted by the arrow CW so as to be moved to its retracted position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> through means of the opposite pivotal or rotational movements of the lug or ear member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, upstanding externally splined shaft <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and annular internally splined cap member <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A vertically oriented support plate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is fixedly mounted upon the distal end portion of the actuating arm <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> through means of a mounting plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> first film clamping plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is fixedly mounted upon an upper portion of the front face of the support plate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, while a second film clamping plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is adapted to be movably mounted upon the front face of the support plate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> so as to be disposed, for example, either at a first lowermost position with respect to the upper clamping plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, or at a second uppermost position with respect to the upper clamping plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. It can readily be appreciated then that when the second film clamping plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is disposed at its first lowermost position with respect to the first film clamping plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the clamping plates <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are disposed at relative OPEN positions with respect to each other such that a portion of a wrapping or packaging film can be interposed therebetween in preparation for a clamping operation to be performed upon such portion of the wrapping or packaging film, or that a portion of the wrapping or packaging film, which has been previously clamped between the clamping plates <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> can now be released from its clamped or retained position or state between the clamping plates <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, of course, when the second film clamping plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is disposed at its second uppermost position with respect to the first film clamping plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the clamping plates <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are disposed at relative CLOSED positions with respect to each other such that a portion of a wrapping or packaging film interposed between the clamping plates <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is either clamped in preparation for a film severing operation to be performed upon such portion of the wrapping or packaging film, or that a portion of the wrapping or packaging film, which has been previously severed, is retained between the clamping plates <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in preparation for the commencement of a new wrapping or packaging operation or cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Continuing further, in order to movably mount the second film clamping plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> upon the vertically oriented support plate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, a first lower mounting block <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is fixedly mounted upon a lower portion of the rear surface of the vertically oriented support plate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, while a second upper mounting block <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is likewise fixedly mounted upon an upper portion of the rear surface of the vertically oriented support plate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. A vertically oriented acme screw shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is rotatably mounted within the lower and upper mounting blocks <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and a drive motor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is mounted atop the upper mounting block <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. A vertically movable carriage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is mounted upon the acme screw shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and the drive motor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is operatively connected to the acme screw shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> such that when the drive motor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is energized so as to alternatively rotatably drive the acme screw shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in opposite angular or rotational directions, the carriage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> will be accordingly driven in upward and downward directions along the acme screw shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the vertically oriented support plate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is also provided with a vertically oriented through-slot <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and a bracket member <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, having a substantially inverted L-shaped configuration and fixedly interconnecting a forward-facing portion of the carriage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> to the lower clamping plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, is adapted to pass through the vertically oriented slot <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> defined within the vertically oriented support plate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In this manner, it can be readily appreciated that the lower clamping plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is able to be moved upwardly and downwardly between its extreme CLOSED and OPENED positions with respect to the upper fixed clamping plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> by means of the carriage drive system or assembly comprising drive motor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, lower and upper mounting blocks <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, acme drive screw shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, carriage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and connecting bracket <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. It is further noted that, in conjunction with the aforenoted structure comprising the carriage drive system or assembly for operatively moving the lower clamping plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and in order to permit the lower clamping plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to be moved into gripping or clamping contact with the upper clamping plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, the upper clamping plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is provided with a through-slot <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Through-slot <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can therefore accommodate that part of the connecting bracket <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, which projects through the through-slot <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> defined within the vertically oriented support plate <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and which connects to the lower clamping plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, when the lower clamping plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is moved upwardly to its uppermost clamping position with respect to upper clamping plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. It is lastly noted that upper clamping plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is provided with an electrically energizable hot wire or cutting wire mechanism <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which, when suitably energized, can cut or sever that portion of the wrapping or packaging film which is gripped or clamped between the upper and lower clamping plates <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> when the lower clamping plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has been moved to its uppermost clamping position with respect to the upper clamping plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Having now described all of the structural components comprising the new and improved mechanism or system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> which is to be utilized in conjunction with package, load, or article wrapping machines, apparatus, or systems for implementing the attachment or securement of a leading edge portion of the wrapping film to the article, load, or package to be wrapped or packaged in preparation for the commencement of a film wrapping or packaging operation or wrapping cycle, as well as the detachment or severance of a trailing edge portion of the wrapping or packaging film from the package, load, or article upon termination of the article, load, or package wrapping or packaging operation or cycle, the operation of the new and improved mechanism or system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will now be described. Assuming that a particular article, load, or package has been previously disposed at a wrapping station, not shown, and that, for example, a rotatable wrapping arm of a wrapping machine, also not shown, has been rotated around the wrapping station in order to spiral wrap the article, load, or package, then upon termination of the wrapping operation or cycle, rotational movement of the wrapping arm is terminated. The electrical linear actuator drive motor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is now energized whereby, through means of rotary-linear conversion drive unit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, piston <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and driven splined members <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, actuating arm <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is now moved from its retracted position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> toward its extended position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. When the actuating arm <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has reached its fully extended position, which may be predetermined, for example, by means of a suitable proximity switch, not shown, energization of the electrical linear actuator drive motor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is terminated and the upper and lower clamping plates <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> are now disposed substantially adjacent to the wrapping or packaging film flow path or locus as determined by means of the wrapping machine wrapping arm, not shown, whereby the upper and lower clamping plates <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> will be disposed, in effect, above and below a portion of the wrapping or packaging film which extends from the wrapped or packaged article, load, or package to the roll of wrapping or packaging film disposed upon a carriage member, not shown, mounted upon the wrapping machine wrapping arm, also not shown, in a manner well-known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, drive motor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can now be energized so as to move the carriage <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and therefore the lower clamping plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> attached thereto, from its lowermost position toward its uppermost position with respect to the upper clamping plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In this manner, that portion of the wrapping or packaging film which is interposed between the upper and lower clamping plates <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is now vertically compressed or crimped together in a clamped or gripped fashion between the upper and lower clamping plates <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and the drive movement of the drive motor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and therefore the upward movement of the lower clamping plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, is then terminated by means of another suitable proximity switch, not shown. Hot wire cutting mechanism <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can now be energized whereby the clamped or crimped portion of the wrapping or packaging film is then severed whereby the severed trailing edge portion of the wrapping or packaging film wrapped around the particular article, load, or package, is simply applied or secured to the article, load, or package under the influence of gravity and its self-adherent properties. The corresponding or complementary severed leading edge portion of the wrapping or packaging film is still retained by the CLOSED clamping plates <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in preparation for the commencement of a new wrapping or packaging operation or cycle to be performed upon or in connection with a new load, article, or package to wrapped or packaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, electrical linear actuator drive motor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is again energized so as to move the actuating arm <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from its extended position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, back to its retracted position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, in order to permit a new article, load, or package, to be wrapped or packaged, to be placed at the wrapping station. An operational START button, not shown, is then pressed by the operator upon, for example, a remote console or the like, and accordingly, the wrapping film roll carriage, not shown, mounted upon the wrapping machine wrapping arm, also not shown, is moved upwardly, for example, so as to initiate the wrapping or packaging operation or cycle at the top of the article, load, or package being wrapped or packaged. At the same time, electrical linear actuator drive motor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is again energized so as to again move the actuating arm <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> from its retracted position, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, to its extended position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The clamping plates <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, still disposed at their relative CLOSED position and therefore still retaining the crimped or clamped leading end portion of the wrapping or packaging film therebetween, are therefore now disposed adjacent the packaging or wrapping film flow path or locus. The packaging or wrapping film now extends, in effect, from the clamping plates <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to the film roll mounted upon the vertically movable carriage, not shown, disposed upon the wrapping arm, also not shown, of the wrapping machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> At this time, the wrapping arm, not shown, of the wrapping machine is rotated through means of an angular rotation of approximately three-quarters of one revolution, or approximately 270&deg;, and is then momentarily stopped. Drive motor <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is then energized so as to move lower clamping plate <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to its OPENED position with respect to upper clamping plate <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> whereby the clamped or crimped leading edge portion of the packaging or wrapping film is now released and permitted to fall under the influence of gravity whereby such leading edge portion of the packaging or wrapping film will in effect self-adhere to the new package, load, or article being wrapped. Electrical linear actuator drive motor <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is now again energized so as to move the actuating arm <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> back to its retracted position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> from its extended position as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, and the wrapping arm, not shown, of the wrapping machine is once again energized so as to complete the particular wrapping or packaging operation or cycle. Upon completion of the entire package, load, or article wrapping or packaging operation, rotational movement of the wrapping machine wrapping arm, not shown, is terminated, an entire operational cycle has been completed, and an entirely new operational cycle may be initiated or implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Thus, it may be seen that in accordance with the principles and teachings of the present invention, there has been provided a new and improved mechanism or system, which can be utilized in conjunction with package, load, or article wrapping machines, apparatus, or systems for implementing the attachment or securement of a leading edge portion of the wrapping film to the article, load, or package to be wrapped or packaged so as to prepare for the commencement of the film wrapping or packaging operation or wrapping cycle, as well as the detachment or severance of a trailing edge portion of the wrapping or packaging film from the package, load, or article upon termination of the article, load, or package wrapping or packaging operation or cycle, in a semiautomatic manner so as to obviate the need for operator personnel to physically, personally, or manually attach or sever the leading and trailing end portions of the wrapping or packaging film to or from the article, load, or package, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Obviously, many variations and modifications of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the present invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. </paragraph>

<claim-text>moving at least one of said first and second clamping members toward the other one of said first and second clamping members such that said first and second clamping members achieve said second CLOSED position so as to clamp a portion of a wrapping film, disposed along the wrapping film flow path locus, therebetween; </claim-text>
<claim-text>actuating a cutter device operatively disposed adjacent to one of said first and second clamping members so as to sever a portion of the wrapping film clamped between said first and second clamping members and thereby free a trailing end portion of the wrapping film extending from a load being wrapped at the wrapping station such that the trailing end portion of the wrapping film can self-adhere to the wrapped load at the wrapping station, as well as to retain a leading end portion of the wrapping film extending to a supply of wrapping film in preparation for a new wrapping operation to be performed upon a new load to be wrapped at the wrapping station; </claim-text>
<claim-text>moving said actuating arm from said second extended position, adjacent to the wrapping film flow path locus, back to said first retracted position, remote from the wrapping film flow path locus, while said first and second clamping members are maintained at said relatively CLOSED position, such that the leading end portion of the wrapping film is maintained in a clamped condition between said first and second clamping members, so as to permit a new load to be wrapped to be disposed at the wrapping station; </claim-text>
<claim-text>moving said actuating arm from said first retracted position, remote from the wrapping film flow path locus, back to said second extended position, adjacent to the wrapping film flow path locus, while said first and second clamping members are maintained at said relatively CLOSED position, such that the leading end portion of the wrapping film is maintained in a clamped condition between said first and second clamping members; and </claim-text>
<claim-text>moving said at least one of said first and second clamping members away from said other one of said first and second clamping members such that said first and second clamping members achieve said first OPENED position so that the clamped leading end portion of the wrapping film is released from its clamped position between said first and second clamping members and permitted to self-adhere to the new load to be wrapped at the wrapping station in conjunction with the performance of a new wrapping operation being performed upon the new load to be wrapped at the wrapping station. </claim-text>
