<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A low loss on-die interconnect structure includes first and second differential signal lines on one of the metal layers of a microelectronic die. One or more traces may also be provided on another metal layer of the die that are non-parallel (e.g., orthogonal) to the differential signal lines. Because the traces are non-parallel, they provide a relatively high impedance return path for signals on the differential signal lines. Thus, a signal return path through the opposite differential line predominates for the signals on the differential lines. In one application, the low loss interconnect structure is used within an on-die salphasic clock distribution network. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Microelectronic devices generally include many on-die interconnects to provide signal delivery and distribution functions for the circuitry. These interconnects are typically used to carry, for example, clock signals, power signals, and/or data signals to various points on the die. In the past, the loss within these on-die interconnects was not a primary concern. Instead, the interconnects were designed to prevent ringing and other signal compromising effects. The loss within on-die interconnects, however, is now becoming a greater concern. For example, one low skew clocking strategy that is currently being considered for use within microelectronic devices is salphasic clocking. Salphasic clocking uses standing waves on a transmission medium to distribute a clock signal in a relatively low skew manner. To generate standing waves that are adequate to support salphasic clocking, however, transmission structures having relatively low loss are typically required. For this and other reasons, there is a need for low loss interconnect structures that can be implemented on-die within a microelectronic device.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. It is to be understood that the various embodiments of the invention, although different, are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described herein in connection with one embodiment may be implemented within other embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In addition, it is to be understood that the location or arrangement of individual elements within each disclosed embodiment may be modified without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims, appropriately interpreted, along with the full range of equivalents to which the claims are entitled. In the drawings, like numerals refer to the same or similar functionality throughout the several views. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a low loss interconnect structure that can be implemented on-die within a microelectronic device. The interconnect structure can be used to replace many of the various interconnects commonly implemented on-die, particularly those used in resonance applications. In clocking networks, for example, the structure can be used to provide, point-to-point connections, tree structures, and/or various grid hierarchies. Because of its low loss, the interconnect structure is particularly beneficial when used as part of a salphasic clock distribution network within a microelectronic circuit. As is well known, the use of low loss transmission structures in salphasic systems can result in significantly lower clock skews within a system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Clocking networks and other on-die signal distribution structures have traditionally been characterized as simple resistance-capacitance (RC) networks. One goal when designing such networks, therefore, has been to minimize circuit inductance. One method to minimize inductance is to place conductive signal return structures close to the signal lines to reduce the size of the effective inductive loop. This technique is enhanced by interleaving signal traces with return traces on the same metal layer of the die. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> are a top view and a sectional side view, respectively, of a conventional interleaved interconnect structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that incorporates these principles. As illustrated, the interconnect structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of signal traces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> that are interleaved on a common metal layer with a plurality of return traces <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A wide parallel return member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is located on a layer below the interleaved traces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The return member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> runs parallel to the signal and return traces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and has a width that is the same as or similar to the total width of the interleaved traces. Another wide parallel return trace (not shown) can also be provided above the interleaved traces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to further reduce series inductance. The return traces <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the wide return member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can be, for example, power or ground structures within the microelectronic die. Often, further inductance reduction will be undertaken for an interconnect by increasing the resistance and capacitance associated with the structure. Resistance can be increased significantly by decreasing the signal conductor width to less than twice the skin depth of the lines. Capacitance can be increased by adding additional interleaved conductors to the interconnect <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. All of these techniques, however, serve to increase the overall signal loss of the interconnect. As described above, future devices will require less signal loss on the individual interconnects of the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> are a top view and a sectional side view, respectively, of a low loss interconnect structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The low loss interconnect structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be implemented, for example, on-die within a microelectronic device (e.g., a microprocessor, a chip set, etc.). The interconnect structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes first and second differential signal lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> on a first metal layer to carry a differential signal within the device. The interconnect structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may also include one or more orthogonal traces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on another metal layer to provide a possible return path for signal components on the first and second differential signal lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In a microelectronic die, wire directions typically alternate on each successive metal layer. To implement the conventional interconnect structure <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, therefore, this convention must be broken to allow the wide return member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to be parallel with the interleaved signal and return traces <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Using the interconnect structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, however, allows the convention to be followed by allowing orthogonal lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to be present on the adjacent metal layers. The orthogonal lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can include, for example, signal or power lines within the microelectronic device. As will be discussed in greater detail, the orthogonal lines <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may also provide a return path for signals propagating on the differential signal lines <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The attenuation coefficient (&agr;) of a transmission line can be represented by the following equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>&agr;&equals;<highlight><italic>Re</italic></highlight>{cube root}((<highlight><italic>R&plus;j&ohgr;L</italic></highlight>)(<highlight><italic>G&plus;j&ohgr;C</italic></highlight>)) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> where R is the series resistance per unit length, L is the series inductance per unit length, G is the shunt conductance per unit length, and C is the shunt capacitance per unit length. In conceiving the present invention, it was appreciated that the loss of a transmission line could be reduced significantly by decreasing R/L without significantly increasing C. In the interconnect structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, the orthogonal traces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> on the lower metal layer are capacitively coupled to the differential signal traces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. However, because they are orthogonal to the signal traces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, the orthogonal traces <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> present a high impedance (e.g., high inductance) return path to signal components propagating on the differential signal traces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. For this reason, the best return path for each differential signal trace <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is through the other differential signal trace <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. As desired, this high inductance return path serves to decrease the value of R/L. Further reduction in the value of R/L is achieved by making the signal traces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> relatively wide to reduce R within the interconnect <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In one design approach, a reasonable interline spacing is initially chosen for the differential signal traces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The widths of the differential signal traces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are then increased until the corresponding increase in capacitance begins to increase the loss of the interconnect <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The spacing between the differential signal traces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is then increased from the initial value until the additional decrease in loss due to the increase in inductance no longer justifies the increased area consumed by the interconnect <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. One or more additional design iterations may then be performed to further optimize the widths and/or spacing of the traces <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Because the interconnect <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> is a differential structure, it is capable of rejecting common mode noise within a microelectronic device. To support differential operation, the drivers, receivers, and repeaters (if any) used in connection with the interconnect <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> should be differential structures. In one implementation, an interconnect using the inventive principles achieved a loss of 0.790 decibels per millimeter (dB/mm) and a phase constant of 0.885 radians/mm at an operational frequency of 10 gigahertz (gHz). In contrast, a conventional interconnect (e.g., interconnect <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) having similar dimensions and materials produces a loss of 1.867 dB/mm and a phase constant of 0.610 radians/mm at 10 gHz. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating the use of a low loss on-die interconnect structure <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to provide a point to point connection within a microelectronic device in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, a differential driver <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> associated with a first electrical component <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (COMPONENT A) is coupled to a first end of the interconnect <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to provide a differential signal (e.g., a clock or data signal) to the interconnect <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for transmission to a second electrical component <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> (COMPONENT B). A differential receiver <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> within the second electrical component <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> receives the differential signal from the interconnect <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for use by circuitry within the second component <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. As shown, the interconnect <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes first and second differential signal lines <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> that are located on a common metal layer of the associated die. A pair of orthogonal traces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are located on a different metal layer of the die. Although only two orthogonal traces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are illustrated, it should be appreciated that any number of such traces may be situated below the differential lines <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. Orthogonal traces may also be present on a metal layer above the differential lines <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, the orthogonal traces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are coupled to a ground terminal <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> on the die. It should be understood, however, that the orthogonal traces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can alternatively be used as, for example, power and/or signal lines. As described above, in the illustrated embodiment, the traces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are orthogonal to the differential signal lines <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. In at least one embodiment, however, the traces <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are at an oblique angle to the differential signal lines <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (i.e., they are neither orthogonal nor parallel to the signal lines <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In at least one application, the low loss interconnect structure of the present invention is used within a salphasic clock network. Salphasic clocking uses standing waves on a transmission medium to distribute a clock signal to multiple points within a system with relatively low skew. Standing waves are created on a transmission line whenever a signal propagating on the transmission line encounters an impedance mismatch on the line. To purposely create a standing wave on a transmission line, an open or short circuit is typically used to terminate the line. When the transmission line is lossless, the standing wave will include a plurality of zero magnitude minima along the length of the transmission line that are located at half wavelength (i.e., &lgr;/2) intervals. These minima mark the locations of abrupt 180 phase changes in the corresponding signal. In each region between adjacent minima, the phase of the corresponding signal is constant. Thus, to some extent, the phase of the signal has been made non-position dependent. It is this non-position dependent phase quality of the standing wave that is taken advantage of in salphasic clocking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating a standing wave <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> that results when a lossless transmission line is terminated in a short circuit. As described above, the standing wave <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes zero magnitude minima at half wavelength intervals along the line. Because the termination is a short circuit, a zero magnitude minima is also present at the termination point (i.e., at x&equals;0). As shown, the signal phase at all points between x&equals;0 and x&equals;&lgr;/2 and between x&equals;&lgr; and x&equals;3&lgr;/2 is zero degrees. Similarly, the signal phase at all points between x&equals;&lgr;/2 and x&equals;&lgr; and between x&equals;3&lgr;/2 and x&equals;2&lgr; is 180 degrees. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating a standing wave <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> that results when a lossy transmission line is terminated in a short circuit. As shown, the minima of the standing wave pattern do not occur at zero magnitude as with the lossless line. In addition, an abrupt phase change is not achieved at half wavelength intervals. Instead, a relatively wide region <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> exists at half wavelength intervals where a gradual phase change between zero and 180 degrees takes place. As can be appreciated, the presence of these large phase change regions <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> can significantly increase skew within a corresponding clock network. For this reason, low loss transmission structures are highly desired within salphasic clock networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> As described previously, in the past, on-die interconnects were typically relatively lossy structures. Thus, these structures were not optimal for use in salphasic clocking networks. The interconnect structure of the present invention, however, is capable of achieving losses that are low enough to make on-die salphasic clocking feasible. In at least one embodiment, the effective loss of the low loss interconnect structure is reduced even further by placing active elements at various locations within the structure (e.g., at various points within a grid) to provide signal gain. Negative impedance converter circuits can be used to reduce the skew proportionally to the decrease in loss. The inventive interconnect structure can be implemented in a variety of different salphasic clock distribution schemes, including salphasic tree structures (e.g., H trees and binary trees) and salphasic grid structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating a salphasic clock grid <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> that is implemented on-die in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated, the salphasic clock grid <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> includes a number of interconnect segments <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> that each include first and second differential signal line portions <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The interconnect segments <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are connected together in a grid pattern that is used to distribute a clock signal to a number of loads (i.e., clocked elements) within a corresponding microelectronic device. The first differential signal line portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of each interconnect segment <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is conductively coupled to the first differential signal line portion <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of each other interconnect segment <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the grid <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> using conductive links <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the second differential signal line portion <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of each interconnect segment <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is conductively coupled to the second differential signal line portion <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> of each other interconnect segment <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the grid <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> using conductive links <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The conductive links <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> will typically include trace portions on other layers of the die (and corresponding via connections). As described previously, orthogonal traces may be present on metal layers adjacent to the grid <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to be used as, for example, power, ground, and/or signal lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, the salphasic clock grid <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is fed a differential clock signal at four different locations <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> on the grid <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Buffer units having small signal, differential outputs can be used to drive the grid <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> at these locations. The salphasic clock grid <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> will generate standing waves using the differential clock signal. The resulting standing wave pattern will depend on a number of factors including: the phasing of the four drive signals, the dimensions of the grid <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and the frequency of the clock signal. The standing wave pattern will have large regions where clock signal phase is position independent. Thus, the loads can be connected to the grid anywhere within these regions to achieve low skew. In at least one embodiment, the signal phase is position independent for the entire grid <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. In a preferred approach, a sinusoidal clock signal is used to simplify phase detection at the load locations, although other clock signal types can alternatively be used. As the reader will appreciate, the inventive interconnect structure can be implemented in a variety of other on-die salphasic clock distribution structures. </paragraph>
