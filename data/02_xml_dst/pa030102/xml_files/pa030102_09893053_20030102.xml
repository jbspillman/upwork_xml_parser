<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the public Patent Office file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to methods for professionals to attract clients, and more particularly to methods of doing so using expert systems. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Professionals have embraced modem technology to advertise their services, as can be seen on many professionals&apos; websites. Many professionals use the Internet solely to make promotional materials available. Some professionals use the Internet to do more, for example by allowing clients to interactively create documents by an expert system for a fee. Another development in the delivery of legal services allows clients to subscribe to legal services which allow the client unlimited access to certain databases of documents, and perhaps telephone support when necessary. A similar system is available in professional insurance plans, which allow the insured access to professional services by paying an insurance premium. Both of these systems require the client to pay before access to the professional services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Developments such as those described above show how professionals have adapted to the Internet and other communications media, but do not take into account the change in the relationship between professionals and their (existing and potential) clients which has occurred due to the latter now having easy and free access to information which was once almost exclusively available to the former (or was difficult to access without a professional). An example is the publication of court decisions, which was once available almost exclusively in law libraries, law schools, courts, law firms and the like. Now many jurisdictions publish court decisions on the Internet. Likewise statutes and sample contracts are generally available on the Internet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> What is needed is a method and system whereby professionals can take advantage of the easy and free accessibility of information by users of the Internet, and thereby efficiently obtain and serve clients; and whereby users of the Internet can take corresponding advantage of such easily and freely accessible information to improve the quality, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency of professional services performed and the convenience of clients. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There is provided a method for a professional to attract clients by marketing to those who have no prior professional relationship with said professional, comprising the steps of: (a) providing at no charge to a public user, the use of an expert system; (b) said expert system providing a Professional End Product in response to said user&apos;s input; (c) providing means for facilitating said user&apos;s communication with said professional; and (d) inviting said user to communicate with said professional to discuss the provision of professional services for a fee.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of this specification and appended claims (and not for the purpose of describing prior art), a &ldquo;professional&rdquo; can be an individual who is a member of a recognized or regulated profession (e.g. lawyers, doctors, dentists, engineers, architects, accountants, dieticians) or not (e.g. lobbyists, computer technicians) and can include any service provider that performs &ldquo;professional services&rdquo; (as hereinafter defined) for a fee, based on personal expertise, about a client&apos;s particular problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of this specification and appended claims, &ldquo;health professionals&rdquo; mean professionals who provides health related services, including, without limitation, doctors, nurses, dentists, chiropractors, dieticians, and masseuses; &ldquo;legal professionals&rdquo; means professionals who provide legal services including, without limitation, lawyers, barristers, solicitors, attorneys, notaries, trade-mark and patent agents; and &ldquo;financial professionals&rdquo; mean professionals who provide financial services, including, without limitation, accountants, financial bookkeepers financial advisors, brokers, and trustees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of this specification and appended claims (and not for the purpose of describing prior art), a &ldquo;Professional Knowledge Base&rdquo;, in relation to a particular profession, means a database (regardless of the form, whether electronic, printed documents or other form) that contains information of a kind found commonly within the professional expertise of a professional in that particular discipline. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of this specification and appended claims (and not for the purpose of describing prior art), a &ldquo;Professional End Product&rdquo; means the product or service of the kind commonly created or delivered to satisfy the purpose of a professional engagement by a client, whether the product or service is partially completed or performed and not yet ready for use, or is filly completed and is enjoyed or enjoyable by the client, but excludes a product or service for the identification of a problem for the client as distinct from the solution of that problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Thus understood, Professional End Product can take the form of a document or report, whether oral or reduced to writing in electronic form, printed on paper or otherwise. Thus understood, Professional End Product does not include a product or service which is only preparatory, intermediate or ancillary to the purpose of the professional engagement (such as a completed questionnaire or a diagnosis) or is of general information or applicability (i.e. being formed independently of a client&apos;s input of particulars). Examples of Professional End Products for the professional engagement of a lawyer include a will, trademark application or contract but do not include the notes developed when interviewing the client for the purposes of developing and delivering such will, application or contract. An example of a Professional End Product for the professional engagement of a doctor might be the development of a treatment (or the performance of a treatment or both) for the rehabilitation of an injured limb but does not include the prior diagnosis of that ailment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of this specification and appended claims (and not for the purpose of describing prior art), an &ldquo;expert system&rdquo; comprises a Professional Knowledge Base and means for applying information from the Professional Knowledge Base to a fact situation or set of desired results specified by the user (by inputting data orally or in written or electronic form). The use of the expert system by a user results in a Professional End Product. This could be simply a form with instructions for completion, through to manual or automated document production systems, to computerised expert systems embodying artificial intelligence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of this specification and appended claims (and not for the purpose of describing prior art), &ldquo;professional services&rdquo; means the services normally provided by a professional in a professional engagement and includes not only providing Professional End Products but also all products and services ancillary or related thereto. Although Professional End Product may be a will or an incorporation of a corporation, for example, the professional services may include the storage of a will for a client or the keeping of a client&apos;s corporate minute books. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> For the purposes of this specification and appended claims (and not for the purpose of describing prior art), an &ldquo;organizer&rdquo; is an entity that is legally distinct from a professional or association of professionals. An organizer may be an individual, a corporation or other recognized legal entity, as long as it is legally distinct from the professionals or association of professionals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an association <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> provides professional services to public users <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For the purposes of this specification by way of example only, mostly legal professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> or lawyers, and legal services are discussed, but the method and system of this invention are appropriate for many other types of professionals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Association <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be a group of lawyers, e.g. a law firm, a corporation or partnership, or a group of otherwise independent lawyers or law firms. Association <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be formally organized, such as a formal partnership having a single market identity, or have a more loosely organized existence, perhaps solely to carry out the method according to the invention. The association may include members from more than one professional groups (e.g. lawyers and accountants), and may include members that are not professionals. In some cases, association <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be self-organized, for example in a single law firm; and in other cases, an outside organizer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, will be retained to assist in the organization and maintenance of association of otherwise independent lawyers, and assist in the creation, updating and maintenance of the expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and other activities necessary or ancillary to the method of marketing contemplated by this invention. The professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> preferably pay the organizer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for the services provided by the organizer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, perhaps taken from the collection of a membership fee to join association <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> but other forms of compensation are contemplated, such as contribution of financing or services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is available to the public at no charge. Expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a Professional Knowledge Base <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and means for users <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the general public to access Professional Knowledge Base <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also includes means <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> for facilitating communication of user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with the professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of association <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be a website functioning on the World Wide Web <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but other communications means are possible (e.g. any other means of transferring Professional End Products, such as a telephone request line that can automatically fax documents, may be used to implement expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). A representative website version of expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Preferably, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, in conjunction with the provision of expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, there will be presented to user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the minimum predefined standards <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> for the provision of services by the professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Such standards <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are those that all professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> have agreed to comply with, as a condition of membership in association <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An example of a standard <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is client pre-approval of all billable professional services to be performed. Another example of a standard <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is that a professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has International Organization for Standardization&apos;s ISO9002 certification. As another example, minimum standard <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may be as general as providing professional services whose cost and quality reflects the utility of the user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&apos;s input as reflected in the Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. In other words, membership in association <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will require that the professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> conform to the minimum standards <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, and the minimum standards <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> will presented (visually, orally or by any other multimedia method) to user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In conjunction with the provision of expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, there will be presented to user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the identity <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> of the provider of expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, for example association <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, or the organizer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. User <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will be able to use expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for the creation of a desired Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> by inputting the data requested by expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In conjunction with the provision of expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, there will be presented to user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the name and contact coordinates of at least one professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of association <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the capability to perform the professional services related to the Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The contact coordinates may be phone numbers, addresses, email addresses, and the like. Preferably, there is provided a list <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of several professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and their respective contact coordinates that are presented to user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> according to geographical organization or order selected by user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (e.g. by state or province; by city), or by professional expertise (e.g. wills, family law, trademarks) or in other ways useful to user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>; or there is a facility for user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to easily search the entire list <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> by professional expertise and/or geography and otherwise. The contact coordinates are simply listed or could be electronic &ldquo;links&rdquo; to the websites of their respective professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> For professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> who normally sell their knowledge and assistance to clients in documentary form, Professional End Products <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are used to attract users <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The types of Professional End Products <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> available will vary according to the types of professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in association <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, legal Professional End Products <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be wills, contracts, trademark applications, plain language versions of &ldquo;legalese&rdquo; documents, or specified types of letters; and while normally documents may take the form of textual materials, they could also take the form of purely oral information given to user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Such wills, contracts, etc., may be fully completed and ready for use by user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or partially completed and not ready for use, as explained below. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, Professional End Products <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> created by expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, are without charge. User <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can obtain and download (e.g. print or electronically store . confidentially at a location chosen by user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, such as user&apos;s personal computer) the Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> created, for subsequent review and use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is used to automate many of the tasks normally done by the IS professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> using means known in the art. For example, for a trademark application, expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be used to query user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> about the identity and address of the applicant, the basis of the application, etc. In another example, for a contract, expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be used to determine the types of clauses that would be appropriate for the contract and to &ldquo;fill in the blanks&rdquo; for certain clauses (e.g., by allow the client to select the governing law of a contract). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In practice, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&apos;s interactive use of expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will lead to the delivery of a Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is merely representative of the process that an expert system may take. Expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will begin the process of providing a document by a query (Query &num;1 at step <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>) for example to insert the appropriate information into the document (step <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>). At the next step (Query &num;2 at step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>) <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will add a clause to the document (step <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>) if the query is answered a certain way. If not, expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will not add the clause and will skip to the next step (Query &num;3 at step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>). Query &num;3, depending on the response, leads to one of Queries &num;4, &num;5, or &num;6 (steps <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, respectively). In the example shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> leads to Professional End Products <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> A, B or C, depending on the input provided by user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Using a less abstract example, expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may ask user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> initial queries to determine the type of Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> sought. Once the precise type of Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is determined (e.g. an employment contract), expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may query user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to determine the types of clauses to insert (e.g. termination terms and benefits). One important clause is that of the governing law of the employment relationship. As a legal professional may be licensed only to practice within a particular geographic area (e.g. a state or province), expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> should provide a Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that appropriate to the location or jurisdiction selected by user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The queries will preferably follow a tree branching structure as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> to ask appropriate queries based on the previous responses by user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Given that the queries asked by a complex expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be somewhat complicated or technical (e.g. using legal terminology that may not be understood by user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>), it is important that expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> include options to answer a query with a &ldquo;don&apos;t know&rdquo;, while allowing user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to complete as much as possible the document, being the desired Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, without requiring further assistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The query process may be relatively simple, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, or may be complex involving hundreds of queries. Generally, the more complex a document expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is capable of producing, the more valuable Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> will be to users <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as a tool and to professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as a means for attracting users <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Such expert systems are well known in the art and are used internally in many professional organizations, such as law firms, but are generally not accessible by users <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and are certainly not provided to users <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at no charge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> must be prepared and maintained, preferably by the professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and/or the organizer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Such maintenance includes the updating, expanding, and monitoring of the quality of Professional End Products <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the organizer monitors the quality of expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the Professional End Products <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> produced. For example, professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> as lawyers may be regulated by geographical factors (e.g. state or provincial license to practise law). In consultation with professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the organizer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> must ensure that expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is adapted to be sensitive to local variations to produce a Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that is relevant in the location specified by user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Keeping the Professional End Products <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> up to date and applicable to each professional&apos;s jurisdiction is important, as most of the professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> will practice in professional disciplines that require frequent modifications and improvements to expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to produce useful Professional End Products <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> If a user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has obtained a Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> from expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, he will, as explained above, also have been presented contact information about contacting a professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> who is knowledgeable in the field in which the Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is relevant. For example, if the Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is an employment agreement and specified to be usable in the state of California, user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will be assisted in the direction of an employment lawyer licensed to practice California employment law (by way of contact coordinates, &ldquo;hot link&rdquo; to that lawyer&apos;s website where applicable, and the like, as explained above). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using expert system (step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>) and obtaining a Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>), may use it as he sees fit (step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>). Given that user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has without charge and conveniently (e.g. by himself at his home computer in the evening) obtained a desired Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> by using expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will likely return to that expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> when the need arises for another Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. If user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> obtains a Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> for which user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> requires no further professional services to use, it is likely to be the sort of Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that is inefficient for a professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to provide to user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, because the time spent by the professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (and resultant cost to user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) to act in place of expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is not time efficiently spent. All the while using expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of association <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are being presented to such user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a certain amount of &ldquo;inclination&rdquo; is being generated in user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> towards them, with the ultimate purpose being that user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contacts a professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to review, for a fee, the Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> thus produced or to otherwise professionally engage a professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on some other legal matter. Also, user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may require more professional services than originally thought, or may require services ancillary to the Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> itself (for example wills storage, or keeping corporate minute books). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It may be that user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, after using expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, obtains a Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that is only partially complete and requires further modification before being usable (query step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>). Expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may provide such partially complete Professional End Products <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in some common scenarios when users <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> interact with any expert system, whether of this invention or otherwise. One scenario is that user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> stopped prematurely inputting in response to expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>&apos;s query process, simply because user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> was tired or was unable to answer a query because user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> did not have the information or didn&apos;t even understand the query. Another scenario is that the end product actually desired by user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is beyond what expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can produce. For example, user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> wants a Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which is a complex will that relates to properties situated in several jurisdictions, each with differing legal regimes. Although expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> creates an end product that looks like a will, expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is not capable of producing such a will and so the produced document is not a useable Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (i.e. is not usable as a will) in that condition. In such cases of a partially completed Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will need professional services to complete the Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. For the purposes of this specification and appended claims (and not for the purpose of describing prior art), such a partially complete document is still considered a Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> To obtain assistance and render usable a partially complete Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may contact a professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> (step <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>). As the Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> has already been partially completed, the time spent by the professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to complete the Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may in some situations be reduced, thereby making the professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> more efficient (relative to starting from the beginning with a potential client who did not bring in a document whose basic content the professional was already familiar with), and any efficiency might be reflected in a reduced fee, reflective of that efficiency, for the final product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> More generally, the professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may offer his professional services on terms that reflect the utility of any Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (whether complete or partially complete); i.e. users <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, i.e. who have a Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, enjoy &ldquo;preferred&rdquo; status and enjoy &ldquo;preferred terms&rdquo;. In association <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it might be that all professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> agree, as a condition of membership, to extend such preference to such users <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> User <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&apos;s input when interacting with expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be protected using means known in the art so that such input, which may include personal information of user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, will be available only to user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, such input and the resulting PEP will not be stored within hardware/software implementing expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In such a case, input of user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will be revealed to the professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> with which user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is interacting, only by user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> disclosing such input directly or providing the Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, to professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in person. In another embodiment, expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is adapted to store such input and Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and allows user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to electronically give a selected professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> access to such input or Professional End Product <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The present invention takes advantage of improvements in modem technology and the improvement in the average person&apos;s use thereof (e.g. increased use of personal computers and of word processing software; surfing the World Wide Web for free information; and the like). A professional&apos;s ability to charge for his services is based on both his expertise, experience and access to the information necessary to ply the professional&apos;s craft (e.g. the legal profession, where to find the appropriate precedent, statute, or case law). As this sort of information has become much more accessible through free databases, users <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the general public are less willing to pay for information they can access themselves. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> This ability of users <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to self-service their professional needs even partially, can be taken advantage of by using the method according to the invention. Furthermore, frequent dissatisfaction with the costs of obtaining professional services would be minimized as users <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> could do some of the work themselves and thereby focus the professional&apos;s time spent to that on issues beyond the capability of user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. From the professional&apos;s point of view, the work performed for user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> using the invention would be at a higher skill level as user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> would have performed some or all of the &ldquo;legwork&rdquo; himself, without taking unnecessary time of the professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, from a risk or liability viewpoint, another advantage to the professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is that user <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> takes the responsibility of the work done by himself, rather than passing such liability on to the professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The association <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> allows the professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> therein to pool their resources for marketing and branding their services. Organizer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may have the responsibility of promoting expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> should function as a revenue generator for the professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by attracting users <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to become clients, it is not necessary that it directly generate revenue from users <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or from third parties (e.g., there is no need to sell advertising space on expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>). Furthermore, professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in association <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will have access to expert system <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which, in its creation and maintenance, incorporates the knowledge of the other professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Therefore each professional <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> in association <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can take advantage of the skills, experiences and efforts of other association professionals <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> While the principles of the invention have now been made clear in the illustrated embodiments, it will be immediately obvious to those skilled in the art that many modifications may be made of structure, arrangements, and algorithms used in the practice of the invention, and otherwise, which are particularly adapted for specific environments and operational requirements, without departing from those principles. The claims are therefore intended to cover and embrace such modifications within the limits only of the true spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
