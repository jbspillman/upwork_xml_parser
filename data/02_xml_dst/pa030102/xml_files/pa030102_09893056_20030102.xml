<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to vehicles used to mow grass and similar vegetation and more specifically to an air intake screen used with such vehicles. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Vehicles such as commercial mowers are commonly used for extended periods in warm climates. Since these vehicles typically utilize liquid cooled engines, they have fans and radiators for cooling the liquid. Similarly, they generally use hydraulic oil to power lift cylinders and related power needs on the vehicle. This oil is also cooled by passing it through an oil cooler. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As the blades of the implements drawn by the mower cut grass and similar vegetation, the drier cut grass particles and similar foreign materials become airborne. Typically air intake screens are provided in front of the heat exchangers, that is the radiator and oil cooler, to minimize the build up of such foreign materials on the heat exchangers and the consequent effect on the cooling of the water and oil. These intake screens also serve to minimize the amount of foreign material being drawn into the engine combustion system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It has been common to place air intake screens directly in front of the cooling fan and heat exchangers at the rear of the engine compartment. Generally these screens are oriented vertically. Since the dust and airborne particles are more predominate near the cutting decks and lower portions of the mower, such placement frequently results in the screens becoming filled with foreign material, thereby requiring frequent servicing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One attempt in reducing the accumulation of material on the screen of a front mount mower was to place the screen at the front of the engine compartment and directly behind the operator seat. While this located the screen further from the dust and swirling airborne materials at the lower portions of the mower, it still used a smaller screen which resulted in frequent cleanings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide an air intake screen for use with a mower that extended the time between required cleanings. Further, it would be desirable to provide an air intake screen that provided sufficient filtered air for the liquid coolant radiator, the oil cooler and the engine combustion system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It would as well be desirable to provide an air intake screen that reduced engine overheating, hydraulic oil overheating, and lost time for screen cleanings. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Toward these ends, there is provided a tubular air intake screen that draws air in throughout its 360 degree exterior surface. The screen is placed above the engine compartment to minimize exposure to the dry grass particles and similar foreign materials generated by the mower blades. The screen is sealed at its forward end and open at its rearward end to funnel filtered air to a vertical duct work that leads to a fan and engine air intake duct. The fan moves filtered air over the liquid and oil heat exchangers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> With the present invention, a large volume of filtered air is available and the cleaning cycle for servicing the screen is substantially extended.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Looking first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is illustrated a rear elevated perspective view of a front mount mower <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> utilizing the tubular air intake screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> subject of the present invention. It will be understood that not all of the operator station elements are shown nor are the side and front cutting deck implements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The mower <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> supported by front and rear wheels <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> further supports left and right implement lift structures, only one portion of the left structure <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> being shown. Carried in the rear portion of the frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is an engine <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Looking as well to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it can be seen that the engine compartment <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is carried in the mid portion of the frame <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, behind the operator station <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and enclosed in a hood <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> having sides <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a top surface <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The engine <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the preferred embodiment is liquid cooled and is provided with a radiator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> at the rear portion of the engine compartment <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The engine <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is further provided with a combustion air intake duct <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that leads to an air filter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> above the engine <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The mower <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is also provided with a hydraulic oil system for powering the mower deck lift cylinders <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and related other power needs of the mower <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The mower&apos;s hydraulic fluid reservoir is provided with a line <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that leads to an oil cooler <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at the rear of the engine compartment <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. These heat exchangers, that is the radiator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for the liquid or water and the oil cooler <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for the hydraulic oil system are vertically stacked in the preferred embodiment. Both heat exchangers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are positioned in front of a cooling fan <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> at the rear of the engine compartment <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Looking as well to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, it can be seen that the forward end of the mower <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is provided with the operator station <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> including a seat <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and a rollover protection device (ROPS) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Although not shown, the operator station <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> would be equipped with forward and reverse foot controls, brakes, steering wheel, throttle, and other related controls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Looking now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, it will be seen that the tubular air intake screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is generally elliptical in configuration and fore and aft elongated. In the preferred embodiment, the screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is constructed of perforated steel and includes air inlet openings <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> over its full 360 degree exterior surface. At the forward end of the screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, there is a cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> blocking the entry of air. The rear end of the screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is open and in communication with a bezel or vertical duct work <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that is removably attached to the rear of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Looking back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, it can be seen that when the duct work structure <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is attached to the rear of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, it encloses the cooling fan <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and the engine combustion air intake duct <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. An airtight seal is provided between the ductwork structure <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the frame structure <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is sealingly received, as is best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, between an inside flange <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the framework <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> carried at the rear of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and an outer lip <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the duct <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> when it has been attached. A similar inner and outer flange arrangement is provided to secure the forward end of the screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> where the cover <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is provided to prevent intake of unfiltered air. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In operation, the front mount mower <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is utilized to carry left and right as well as forward decks for cutting grass and similar vegetation. As the mower <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is used, the cutting blades will lift and cut the grass. In doing so, the blades generate a substantial air movement which causes dryer grass clippings and foreign material to swirl around the decks and lower portion of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Because the air intake screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is located at the upper portion of the vehicle <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, less of the clippings and foreign material will be drawn into the screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which is spaced above and apart from the engine compartment <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, will draw air into its duct like interior channel from all around its 360 degree exterior surface. With such a large intake surface area and with the screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> located well above the decks, there will be less of a tendency for the screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to become clogged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As the cooling fan <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> rotates, it draws air through the screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, rearwardly through the tubular structure of the screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and then downwardly within the vertical duct work <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The cooling fan <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is located rearwardly of the vertically stacked oil and liquid heat exchangers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment, the radiator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> for the water is on the top and the oil cooler <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> for the hydraulic oil is positioned there beneath. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Since the air intake screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> draws air throughout its 360 degree exterior tubular surface, the likelihood of foreign material filling its openings <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and clogging it during daily operation is reduced. The elevated location of the screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> further serves to reduce its exposure to the airborne foreign matter as well. When the operator needs to clean the screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, he simply uses an air hose to blow foreign material particles from the openings <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The hood or engine cover <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> swings open to allow access to the cooling fan <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, heat exchangers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and the interior portion of the screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. For further access to the interior portion of the screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the duct work <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can be removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With the present invention, there is provided an air intake screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a substantial surface area that permits substantial volumes of air to be provided to the cooling fan <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> to cool the heat exchangers <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and provide clean air to the engine <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. With the elevated location of the screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, it is removed from much of the airborne foreign material and thereby reduces the rate at which the material accumulates within the openings <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, overheating of the engine <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and/or hydraulic system is minimized and time between servicing requirements for cleaning the screen <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is substantially extended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Having described the preferred embodiment, it will become apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
