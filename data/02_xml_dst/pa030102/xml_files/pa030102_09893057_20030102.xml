<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The field of invention relates to game apparatus for a group of participants each of which is competitively attempting to be the first to complete a passage through a board game and more particularly to a series of three board games linked so as to provide additional challenges and opportunities to the players. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Board games consist generally of one board around which players are seated, were the roll of dice allows players to progress, using game pieces, from one square to the next, In such games, rewards and penalties are randomly encountered as the dice provide the number of moves each player can make, the randomness of the dice themselves adding fairness and chance to the game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Such board games, while still enjoying enormous popularity, are limited in longevity because they eventually become less interesting to the players and fall into disuse. Family games in which children and parents can interact have long been recognized as a vital component in building strong family units and the challenge and excitement of new games continues this interaction. There is therefore, a constant need for new games with new challenges as the older ones age and become less interesting. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A multiple board game is provided to challenge individual participants to be the first to proceed from the first board through a second and third game on a second board. It is a primary object of the invention to provide entertainment to multiple game players (3 to 6) by using two boards each decorated in a generally medieval theme with King&apos;s, Queens, Jesters, Executioners, Dragons and other symbology. The boards are each divided into a succession of printed rectangular blocks each block having either a reward or penalty associated with it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the invention to have a main board designed with the printed rectangular blocks arranged around the perimeter of the board leaving an open area in the center of the board for a penalty area named THE DUNGEON. Two further areas within the center space are designated for game cards; JESTER CARDs and BONUS BUFFOON cards. The central portion is generally decorated as a lake or moat surrounding THE DUNGEON. The lake is inhabited by dragons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the invention to have players use a single die to begin the game and to advance each player in turn through the game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the invention to add interest to the game by having some of the Blocks grant players either a JESTER CARD or a BONUS BUFFOON card. The JESTER CARDs either reward or penalize the player. The BONUS BUFFOON cards are each color matched to one of the player Game Pieces and when a player lands on a block which awards a BONUS BUFFOON card, the player must take the one matching his/her Game Piece color. The BONUS BUFFOON cards are used by players to add penalties to their opponents by placing cards on chosen blocks, in the hope that the opponent will land on the card and incur the penalty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the game to have players win an opportunity to advance to the second board and participate in the two games thereon. The first game on the second board is the DOOR PICK game, so named because it consists of a numbered series of doors upon which six Door Pick cards are placed. By rolling the die, a player takes the Door Pick card and is either rewarded or penalized thereby. One of the Door Pick cards permits the player to progress to the final game THE EVIL JESTER GAME. Progress through this game is by throw of the die and moving a game piece as in the main game. While a player is engaged in either the DOOR PICK or THE EVIL JESTER GAME, the other players back at the main board wait until that player either successfully progresses through THE EVIL JESTER GAME or is eliminated.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The player must keep rolling until he/she lands either on the Snake, Executioner or the Evil-Jester at which time, unless the player has a Life Star to surrender, they are out of the game. If the player is fortunate enough to go beyond all of them, then they have reached the end and won the game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> If the player arrives within six blocks of the FINISH, then he/she must roll the corresponding number on the die to finish the game. For example; If the player is two blocks from the FINISH, they must roll a 2 to win. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> In the event that two players are left playing and they wish to end the game, they can roll the die and whomever gets the higher number wins the game. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A tie is broken by rolling the die again. It is to be understood that while certain forms of the present invention have been illustrated and described herein, it is not to be limited to the specific forms or arrangement of parts described and shown. </paragraph>
