<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a radiator grille for motor vehicle and, more particularly, to such a radiator grille sensor, which has a three-dimensional profile, fits different vehicle radiators, and is inexpensive to manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Following fast development of economics, to have a motor vehicle is no longer a wild hope of a family nowadays in many countries around the world. Various motor vehicles are commercially available. These motor vehicles commonly have a radiator for cooling the engine. Different motor vehicles are equipped with a different grille to protect the radiator. Because different radiator grilles must be used to fit different motor vehicles, the manufacturing cost of radiator grilles is high. Further, conventional radiator grilles are flat members that do not have a three-dimensional profile. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is one object of the present invention to provide a radiator grille, which fits any of a variety of motor vehicle radiators. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a radiator grille, which has a three-dimensional profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide a radiator grille, which is inexpensive to manufacture. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the radiator grille comprises two vertical end walls, two longitudinal series of openings respectively formed on the two vertical end walls, and a plurality of channel tile-like grille portions arranged in parallel between the vertical end walls and formed integral with one another. The channel tile-like grille portions each comprises two vertical walls, a horizontal wall connected between the vertical walls, a plurality of arched holes symmetrically formed on the vertical walls and arranged in a longitudinal line on each of the vertical walls, and a plurality of elongated slots obliquely transversely formed on the horizontal wall and arranged in parallel and respectively connected between the arched holes on the vertical walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The radiator grille can be cut subject to the desired size to fit any of a variety of motor vehicle radiators. The holes and slots enable the radiator grille to be bent into a smoothed arched shape for easy installation in any of a variety of motor vehicles. Further, the channel tile-like grille portions show a three-dimensional profile.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a radiator grille <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention is a corrugated sheet member comprising a plurality of channel tile-like grille portions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> arranged in parallel and formed integral with one another. Each channel tile-like grille portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprises two vertical walls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a horizontal wall <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> connected between the vertical walls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, arched holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> symmetrically formed on the vertical walls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and arranged in a longitudinal line on each vertical wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, elongated slots <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> obliquely transversely formed on the horizontal wall <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and arranged in parallel and respectively connected between the arched holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> on the vertical walls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The radiator grille <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further comprises two longitudinal series of openings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> respectively formed on the two vertical end walls thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. from <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> again, the radiator grille <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is properly cut subject to a predetermined shape to fit the radiator of the motor vehicle, and then the left and right ends of the well-cut radiator grille <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are bent downwards to curve the radiator grille <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for enabling the radiator grille <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be inserted into the opening for radiator grille on the front side of the motor vehicle and then set into position. Because the radiator grille <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has arched holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and elongated slots <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> on its channel tile-like grille portions <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and openings <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on its two vertical end walls thereof, it can be smoothly curved into an arched status as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, and then installed in the motor vehicle to protect the radiator. When installed, the radiator grille <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> protect the radiator against pebbles and external objects, and the arched holes <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and elongated slots <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> work as air vents to guide outside cooling air to the surface of the radiator, enabling the radiator to the engine of the motor vehicle efficiently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A prototype of radiator grille has been constructed with the features of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&tilde;<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The radiator grille functions smoothly to provide all of the features discussed earlier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Although a particular embodiment of the invention has been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications and enhancements may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited except as by the appended claims. </paragraph>
