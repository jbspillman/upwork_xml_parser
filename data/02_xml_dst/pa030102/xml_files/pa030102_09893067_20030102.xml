<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A hierarchical clock distribution system includes a global clock grid that distributes a clock signal to a plurality of regional clock grids. Each of the regional clock grids then distributes the signal to a plurality of corresponding loads. The regional clock grids utilize salphasic clocking techniques to distribute the clock signal to the corresponding loads. The global grid achieves low skew based on the periodicity of the clock signal, rather than the dominance of a standing wave. The electrical distance to termination within the regional clock grids is preferably kept low to avoid the occurrence of phase change regions on the regional grids. In one approach, the regional grids are each driven at multiple points in a symmetrical fashion to reduce the electrical distance to termination. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to microelectronic circuits and, more particularly, to clock distribution structures for use therein. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Clock distribution has become a major on-chip performance bottleneck within microprocessors and other integrated circuits (ICs). As clock frequencies increase, proportionately lower clock skews are required. At the same time, clock interconnects begin to behave more like transmission lines than simple resistance-capacitance (RC) networks. For conventional clock grids and trees, which seek to remain in the RC domain, two options for supporting increased clock speeds include: (a) increasing the resistance and capacitance of the clock lines relative to inductance of the lines, and (b) reducing the interconnect length between buffers within the clock network. Neither of these approaches, however, can provide the performance increases that will be required by integrated circuits of the future. For example, an increase in line capacitance will typically require an increase in power. As ICs become smaller, however, on-die heat dissipation becomes a bigger problem and lower power circuit techniques are desired. Also, an increase in either resistance or capacitance will increase the time constant of the circuit, which increases skew. Similarly, a reduction in interconnect length between buffers will require the insertion of additional buffers into the clock network, which will increase power consumption and typically result in additional clockjitter and skew. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Salphasic clocking is a technique that makes use of standing waves to achieve low clock skew within a system. Salphasic clocking techniques also typically consume substantially less power than other known clocking strategies. In the past, it has been difficult to implement salphasic clocking on-die within an IC. One reason for this difficulty is that salphasic clocking generally requires a low loss transmission medium to maintain a dominant standing wave. On-die interconnects, however, have traditionally been relatively lossy structures. In an ideal lossless system, standing waves include abrupt 180 degree phase changes at specific locations on the corresponding transmission medium. When loss is introduced, however, the abruptness of the phase changes are reduced, creating regions of unacceptable phase differences on the medium. These phase differences can introduce a significant amount of clock skew to the system. In addition, the inherent position dependent amplitudes associated with salphasic clocking techniques can also introduce skew, even in a relatively lossless system.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that show, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. It is to be understood that the various embodiments of the invention, although different, are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described herein in connection with one embodiment may be implemented within other embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In addition, it is to be understood that the location or arrangement of individual elements within each disclosed embodiment may be modified without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims, appropriately interpreted, along with the full range of equivalents to which the claims are entitled. In the drawings, like numerals refer to the same or similar functionality throughout the several views. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Salphasic clocking systems take advantage of the unique characteristics of standing waves to effect low skew clock distribution. A standing wave is created whenever a wave traveling on a transmission medium encounters an unmatched condition (e.g., an unmatched termination or other impedance discontinuity). When the wave encounters the unmatched condition, some or all of the incident energy of the wave is reflected back into the transmission medium as a reflected wave. For example, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> traveling wave V<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>propagating on a transmission medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (having a characteristic impedance Z<highlight><subscript>O</subscript></highlight>) is incident upon a load impedance Z<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight><highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> terminating the line. Because Z<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>is not equal to Z<highlight><subscript>O</subscript></highlight>, a wave V<highlight><subscript>r </subscript></highlight>is reflected back onto the transmission medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the load impedance. The frequency of the reflected wave V<highlight><subscript>r </subscript></highlight>is the same as the frequency of the incident wave V<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>. The magnitude and phase of the reflected wave V<highlight><subscript>r </subscript></highlight>will depend upon, among other things, the relationship between Z<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>and Z<highlight><subscript>O</subscript></highlight>. The incident wave V<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>and the reflected wave V<highlight><subscript>r </subscript></highlight>combine on the transmission medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to form a standing wave on the medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A standing wave is typically represented as an envelope showing the maximum signal amplitude that will occur at points along a transmission medium. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a diagram illustrating a standing wave pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> that develops on a lossless transmission medium that is terminated in a short circuit (i.e., Z<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>&equals;0). Because of the short circuit, the standing wave pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a magnitude of zero at the location of the termination (i.e., at x&equals;0). The standing wave pattern <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> also has a number of zero magnitude minima at half wavelength intervals along the medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the termination point (i.e., at x&equals;&lgr;/2,&lgr;,3&lgr;/2, etc.). At these points, the incident wave and the reflected wave each have the same amplitude and opposite polarity (for all time t) and thus cancel one another. Standing wave maxima <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> occur at points between the minima (e.g., at x&equals;&lgr;/4, 3&lgr;/4, 5&lgr;/4, etc) where the incident and reflected waves combine in-phase. When a standing wave exists on a medium, the signal at any particular point x along the medium will oscillate between a positive and negative maximum value. This maximum value is indicated by the magnitude of the standing wave envelope at that particular location x. Standing wave patterns having zero magnitude minima will result whenever a lossless transmission line is terminated in a lossless load impedance (e.g. an open circuit, a short circuit, a pure reactance). Such standing waves will be referred to herein as &ldquo;pure standing waves.&rdquo; The location of the minima and maxima in a pure standing wave will depend upon the type of lossless load impedance that is being used (e.g., an open circuit will generate maxima x&equals;0 and at intervals of &lgr;/2 therefrom, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A significant feature of standing waves is that they have a phase that, to a large extent, is position independent. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, for example, all points on the medium between x&equals;0 and x&equals;&lgr;/2 will have the same signal phase (say, e.g., zero degrees) regardless of position. Similarly, all points on the medium between x&equals;&lgr;/2 and x&equals;&lgr; will have the same phase, but will be 180 degrees out of phase with the points between x&equals;0 and x&equals;&lgr;/2. Between x&equals;&lgr; and x&equals;3 &lgr;/2 the phase is the same as the phase between x&equals;0 and x&equals;&lgr;/2, and so on. Thus, the signal phase changes abruptly by 180 degrees at half wavelength intervals along the medium, but within each region the signal phase is substantially constant (i.e., position independent). Salphasic clocking seeks to take advantage of these phase attributes to provide low skew clock distribution within a system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> When either the load impedance <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or the transmission medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has loss, a pure standing wave will not be achieved. This is because the incident wave and the reflected wave will not have the same amplitude at the stationary minima points and, therefore, will not cancel. The combined signal on the transmission medium <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will thus be part standing wave and part traveling wave. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a standing wave pattern <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that results when a lossy transmission medium is terminated in a short circuit. As shown, the minima of the standing wave pattern <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> do not extend to zero as in the case of the pure standing wave. Also, the minima are rounded instead of being sharp. Thus, there are no abrupt 180 phase changes as in the pure standing wave. Instead, there are regions <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> where the phase slowly transitions between zero degrees and 180 degrees. These regions of transitioning phase can significantly impact the ability to provide low skew clocking in a salphasic system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a hierarchical clock distribution system for use in distributing a clock signal to multiple clocked elements in a relatively low skew manner using salphasic clocking techniques. The hierarchical clock distribution system is capable of low skew clock distribution even when relatively lossy transmission structures are being used. Thus, the clock distribution system can be used to provide on-die salphasic clocking within a microelectronic device (e.g., a microprocessor or other digital processing device). In one embodiment, the hierarchical system uses a global grid structure to distribute a clock signal to a plurality of regional grids. Each of the regional grids then distributes the clock signal to a plurality of corresponding loads (i.e., elements being clocked). The global grid achieves low skew based on the periodicity of the clock signal, rather than the dominance of a standing wave. For this reason, many of the inherent problems associated with salphasic clocking on lossy lines are avoided on the global grid. The regional grids, on the other hand, utilize salphasic clocking techniques to distribute the clock signal to the corresponding loads. Preferably, the regional grids are designed to avoid standing wave phase change regions that can introduce skew into the system. In one approach, this is accomplished by maintaining the electrical distance to termination on the regional grids below a predetermined value (e.g., one-half wavelength). The inventive principles can be used to distribute a clock signal in any of a wide range of different systems requiring low skew clocking. As described above, the inventive principles are particularly beneficial for use in on-die salphasic clock distribution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> are top views illustrating a global clock grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a regional clock grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, respectively, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The global clock grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is operative for distributing an input clock signal to a plurality of the regional grids <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> within the same clock distribution system. The regional clock grids <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> then distribute the clock signal to a plurality of loads (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) coupled to each regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of transmission line segments <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that are arranged in a grid pattern. The transmission line segments <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> define a number of substantially square regions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The regional grids <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be implemented within the square regions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on a common metal layer as the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or in alignment with the square regions <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on a different metal layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a feed structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> that is used to feed the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The feed structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> will be centrally located with respect to the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and can be on the same metal layer as the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or on a different layer. As shown, the feed structure <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> includes a clock signal source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (e.g., an oscillator and phase locked loop) with four equal length transmission line segments <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> extending therefrom. Each of the transmission line segments <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> emanating from the clock source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is terminated at a receiver point <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. Each receiver point <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> will typically have a receiver associated with it for sensing the clock signal at that point. The signals at the receiver points <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are each coupled to the input of a corresponding buffer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through, for example, a via connection. Because the transmission line segments <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are each the same length, the buffers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are each driven at substantially the same phase. As will be appreciated, other techniques for providing multiple equal phase input clock signal components also exist. In a preferred approach, a sinusoidal clock signal is used within the clock distribution system to facilitate phase detection at the load locations. Also, small signal, differential signaling is preferred to provide low power, highly robust operation. It should be appreciated, however, that many alternative clock signal schemes can be used in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the buffers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> each drive a separate portion of the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the illustrated embodiment. Each of these grid portions has a number of receiver points <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> distributed thereon at predetermined locations. As before, each receiver point <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can include a receiver unit to sense the signal at that point. The signals from the receiver points <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are each coupled to the inputs of corresponding buffers <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> within an associated regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. If the regional grids <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are on a different layer than the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, via connections will be used to couple the signals receiver points <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to the buffer inputs on the regional grids <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. If the regional grids <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are on the same layer as the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the coupling can be made with a trace on the same or a different layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Significantly, the receiver points <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are located at positions on the grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that are a multiple of one-half wavelength (i.e., N&lgr;/2, where N is a positive integer) from one another at the nominal clock frequency of the system. Therefore, the signal phases at the receiver points <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are established based upon the periodicity of the traveling waves thereon, and not by the dominance of standing waves on the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the receiver points <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are each located &lgr;/2 from one another on the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, each receiver point <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> receives a clock signal component that is 180 degrees out of phase with signal components received at each adjacent receiver point <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As will be described in greater detail, in one embodiment of the present invention, this 180 degree phase difference is used within the regional grids <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to reduce the electrical distance to termination therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In a clock distribution network, skew is typically greatest in the vicinity of the buffers that are driving the network. Thus, in one aspect of the present invention, separate transmission line sections <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are provided within the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to receive the drive signal from each buffer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, each buffer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is coupled to a center drive point on a corresponding transmission line section <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The ends of the transmission line sections <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are each connected to one of the receiver points <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Because the buffer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is centered, the phase of the clock signal components at the ends of the transmission line sections <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are equal. The signals from the transmission line sections <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> propagate out onto the transmission line segments <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as traveling waves where they are sensed at the corresponding receiver points <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. There will also be a standing wave component on the transmission line segments <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the transmission line sections <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are each one wavelength long at a nominal clock frequency of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, various symmetry points exist within the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that allow the grid to be separated into multiple portions. These symmetry points are located along lines that are equidistant from the global grid buffers <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> where amplitude components from the buffers are each ideally equal. By separating portions of the grid at these points, amplitude variation can be decreased within the clock distribution system. It should be appreciated that the particular shape, size, and arrangement of the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> are not meant to be limiting. That is, a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and configurations are possible in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The regional grids <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the clock distribution system utilize salphasic techniques to maintain low skew. In one aspect of the present invention, each regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is driven at multiple drive points to reduce the effective distance to termination within the grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. By reducing the effective distance to termination, the number of phase change nodes within the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be reduced (or such nodes can be eliminated entirely). For example, the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is driven at four points by four different buffers <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The buffers <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are each substantially centered with respect to one of the sides of the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (which is square in shape). As with the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can include separate transmission structures <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> to receive the drive signals from the buffers <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> to shield the grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from the skew associated with the buffers. As illustrated, the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes multiple lines of symmetry <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that represent points that are equidistant from the buffers <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the points <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that are intersected by the lines of symmetry <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are each equidistant (i.e., electrically as well as physically) from the two closest buffers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As described previously, in one embodiment of the invention, the receiver points <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are separated from one another by one half wavelength along the corresponding transmission line segments. Thus, the clock signal components output by adjacent buffers within the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will be 180 degrees out of phase from one another. For example, the clock signal component at buffer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will be 180 degrees out of phase with the clock signal component at buffer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the clock signal component at buffer <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> will be 180 degrees out of phase with the clock signal component at buffer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Buffers on opposing sides of the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> (i.e., buffers <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> or buffers <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>) will output signal components that are in phase. When the system is operative, zero voltage nodes will be created at each of the symmetry points <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as the signal components from the buffers will have the same amplitude and a 180 degree phase difference at each of the symmetry points <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. These nodes, therefore, will appear as short circuit nodes within the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The distance to termination (i.e., to the short circuit nodes) is therefore reduced within the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In one approach, the maximum electrical distance between the buffers <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the symmetry points <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (i.e., the distance to termination) is kept below &lgr;/2 to prevent the occurrence of phase change regions on the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> When a square-shaped regional grid is used, a minimal distance to termination is achieved by driving the grid at the mid-points of each side of the grid, as described above. It should be appreciated, however, that other techniques for driving the regional grids <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are also possible, such as driving the grids at each of the four comers or at more or less than four locations. It should also be appreciated that the particular shape, size, and arrangement of the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> are not meant to be limiting. That is, a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and configurations are possible in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention, the clock signal components output by each of the four buffers <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> on the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are all in phase. This can be accomplished by, for example, making the receiver points <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> within the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> one wavelength apart (or an integer multiple thereof). Alternatively, in a system that uses differential lines, the differential inputs of two of the buffers on the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be switched (e.g., buffer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and buffer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>) to achieve four in-phase drive signals on the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. When the regional grid drive signals are in-phase, the signal components at each symmetry point <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> on the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> from each corresponding buffer are in phase and thus combine to form a magnitude maximum on the grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The symmetry points <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will thus appear as open circuit nodes. As before, the effective distance to termination is reduced. Significantly, if the maximum electrical distance between each symmetry point <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and its corresponding buffers is kept below &lgr;/4 (where &lgr; is the wavelength of the standing wave), then phase change regions (e.g., region <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) can be avoided on the regional grids. In one approach, the propagation constant &bgr; of the regional grid lines is made low to increase the standing wave wavelength and thus ensure the absence of phase change nodes on the regional grid. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> As described above, a plurality of unbalanced loads will be connected to each of the regional grids <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. These loads are the actual circuits that are to be clocked by the clock distribution system. The load device receivers can be coupled anywhere on the corresponding regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. That is, they are not limited to predetermined locations like the receiver points <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As in any standing wave pattern, there will be amplitude variation with position on the lines of the regional grid <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. This position dependent amplitude variation can result in skew in a salphasic system, even when near lossless conditions are maintained. In one embodiment of the present invention, therefore, receivers are used for the load devices that have an opposite magnitude dependence so that the skew is cancelled within the receiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As described above, the receiver points <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are spaced N&lgr;/2 from one another at a nominal clock frequency of the clock distribution system. When the clock frequency of the system is varied, however, the receiver points <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will not be properly positioned within the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to achieve low skew. That is, acceptable skews will only be possible within a relatively narrow band of frequencies about the nominal frequency. In one aspect of the present invention, tuning capability is added to the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to allow a greater range of clock frequencies to be used. In one approach, for example, the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is designed to support a maximum desired clock frequency. Switchable load capacitances are then provided that allow the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to be tuned in the field to operate at slower than maximum frequencies. In one approach, for example, the gate capacitance of one or more N-type metal oxide semiconductor (NMOS) transistors is used to provide a load capacitance for the global grid. The gate terminal of each NMOS transistor is coupled to the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through a transmission gate. The source, drain, and body of each NMOS transistor is preferably tied to ground. To tune the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to another frequency, the transmission gates are turned on, thus coupling the gate capacitances of the NMOS devices between the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and ground. Many other global grid tuning strategies are also possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> During operation of the clock distribution system, the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will carry both standing waves and traveling waves. Because of the loss on the lines of the global grid, the traveling waves will typically be dominant. As described above, because of the way the receiver points <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are spaced, low skew can be achieved on the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at least within a small range of clock frequencies. The standing waves that are present on the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will tend to increase the range of frequencies for which acceptable skew values can be achieved. This is because the standing waves will tend to make the phase of the signals at the receiver points <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> less position sensitive. As transmission line loss is reduced, the standing wave amplitudes on the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> will become greater (i.e., the global grid will become more salphasic). Therefore, in one approach, an expanded operational frequency range is achieved by using less lossy transmission line structures within the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As described previously, the salphasic nature of a transmission structure will increase as the signal loss of the structure is reduced. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> are a top view and a sectional side view, respectively, of a low loss interconnect structure <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> that is used in at least one embodiment of the present invention to form some or all of the transmission lines within the regional grids <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the clock distribution system. The interconnect structure <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can also be used to form the transmission lines of the global grid <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the system. The interconnect structure <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> includes first and second differential signal lines <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> on a first metal layer of a die to carry a differential clock signal. One or more orthogonal traces <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> may also exist on an adjacent metal layer of the die in proximity to the first and second differential signal lines <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> for use as, for example, signal or power lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The attenuation coefficient (&agr;) of a transmission line can be represented by the following equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>&agr;&equals;Re{square root}</italic></highlight>((<highlight><italic>R&plus;j&ohgr;L</italic></highlight>)(<highlight><italic>G&plus;j&ohgr;C</italic></highlight>)) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> where R is the series resistance per unit length, L is the series inductance per unit length, G is the shunt conductance per unit length, and C is the shunt capacitance per unit length. Thus, the loss of a transmission line can be reduced significantly by decreasing R/L without significantly increasing C. In the interconnect structure <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, the orthogonal traces <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> on the lower metal layer are capacitively coupled to the differential signal traces <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. However, because they are orthogonal to the signal traces <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, the orthogonal traces <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> provide a high impedance return path to signal components propagating on the differential signal traces <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. For this reason, the best return path for signal components on each differential signal line <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is through the other differential signal line <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The differential signal lines <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are made relatively wide to reduce R within the interconnect <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> (which further reduces R/L). In one design approach, the widths of the two differential signal lines <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> are increased until the corresponding increase in capacitance begins to increase the loss of the interconnect <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. The spacing between the differential signal lines <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is then increased until the additional decrease in loss due to the increase in inductance no longer justifies the increased area consumed by the interconnect <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Because the interconnect <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference> is a differential structure, it is capable of rejecting common mode noise within the microelectronic device. To support differential operation, the buffers, receivers, and repeaters (if any) used in connection with the interconnect <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> should be differential structures. In one implementation, an interconnect using the inventive principles achieved a loss of 0.790 decibels per millimeter (dB/mm) and a phase constant of 0.885 radians/mm at an operational frequency of 10 gigahertz (gHz). In contrast, a conventional interconnect (e.g., interconnect <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) having similar dimensions and materials produces a loss of 1.867 dB/mm and a phase constant of 0.610 radians/mm at 10 gHz. It should be appreciated that a wide variety of alternative transmission structures (e.g., microstrip, stripline, coplanar waveguide, interleaved interconnects, etc.) can also be used within the global and regional grids <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described in conjunction with certain embodiments, it is to be understood that modifications and variations may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as those skilled in the art readily understand. For example, the hierarchical clock distribution system of the present invention is not limited to two grid levels (i.e., global and regional grids). That is, additional grid levels can also be implemented as part of the low skew clock distribution system. Such modifications and variations are considered to be within the purview and scope of the invention and the appended claims. </paragraph>
