<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains in general to geophysical seismic exploration and in particular to a method for linking a geophysical display to a geographic area and a medium containing seismic data files for producing the geophysical display. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The process of collecting geophysical seismic data typically involves generating a seismic wave and measuring the response of the Earth&apos;s surface to the wave by using a plurality of receivers. The seismic wave may be generated by a source, such as a vibrator operating at a controlled frequency and amplitude, or may simply be the explosion of an amount of dynamite. At sea, air guns that eject compressed air may be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The reflected signals are collected by receivers and transmitted to a recording unit. Receivers, such as geophones or hydrophones, are typically positioned in a line or other geometric pattern throughout an area to be seismically mapped. The received data is used to measure the time of the seismic waves as they travel down through the Earth&apos;s surface and are reflected back by the various layers of materials forming the Earth&apos;s subsurface geology. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As the seismic wave (i.e., a shot) is initiated, the reflected signals are collected by each receiver for an amount of time to produce a set of geophysical seismic data. The geophysical seismic data is collected and stored on magnetic tape in industry standard formats. The recorded data is combined and processed. The resulting data represents subsurface geology and can be displayed. Rasterizing can be used to create an image file, which can then be plotted and studied by seismic experts. Study of geophysical seismic data can reveal important information, such as the location of oil, gas, and mineral deposits. Thus, the geophysical seismic data can be extremely valuable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While there are many potential buyers of such geophysical seismic data, the large volume of seismic data that are available, coupled with the large size of each seismic data file, can make it difficult for a potential buyer to effectively sort through the available seismic data and select the desired files. To illustrate, a buyer wishing to review a seismic data file for potential purchase generally begins by making inquiries with a data broker. Request and release forms corresponding to the requested data files are prepared and sent to the appropriate parties for signatures. Once approval is obtained from the owner of the seismic data, the processed seismic data is either plotted to create hard copy prints of seismic sections, which are then sent to the broker&apos;s office, or hard copies are retrieved from a storage facility. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> When the hard copy prints are received, the buyer is contacted and invited to view the images of the seismic sections. Since the hard copy prints contain important seismic data, care must be taken to protect the ownership interests of the owner of the seismic data. Thus, the buyer is usually permitted to view the hard copy prints only while in the broker&apos;s office. The buyer can then decide whether to purchase the full seismic data file and/or the hard copy prints. Depending on a number of factors, such as the speed of obtaining the appropriate approvals, and the speed of creating and shipping the hard copy prints, the entire process can take from two to four weeks to complete. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A further complication may arise if the buyer is uncertain as to the specific data that the buyer wishes to purchase. For example, while the buyer may be interested in a certain county or other geographic region, the buyer may only wish to purchase data for those specific areas that indicate a high likelihood of oil and gas deposits. In this circumstance, the buyer may request a number of hard copy prints for inspection, but may only purchase the data corresponding to the more pertinent prints. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thus, there is a need to decrease the amount of time required to process a request for seismic data, such that a potential buyer can more quickly have access to the desired seismic data, while at the same time protecting the ownership interests of the owner of the seismic data and reducing the costs of providing the seismic data to a potential buyer. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the invention is directed to an article of manufacture having a plurality of computer readable files relating to geophysical seismic data recorded thereon. The article comprises a medium having the computer readable files recorded thereon. The files include data for a map display for a geographical area. The map display has multiple levels of geographic detail and includes a plurality of surface seismic data lines. The files further include data for a plurality of compressed seismic data files corresponding respectively to the surface seismic data lines. Each of the compressed seismic data files is used to produce a corresponding geophysical display when its corresponding surface seismic data line is selected. The files also include a plurality of references to a plurality of full seismic data files. The references correspond respectively to the plurality of compressed seismic data files. Each of the compressed seismic data files has less information content than its corresponding full seismic data file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a method for enabling a buyer to select a full seismic data file desired from among a plurality of full seismic data files. A computer system reads a map of a geographic area from a computer readable medium. The map is displayed to enable selection of a region within the geographic area. The selected region can then be displayed at a higher level of detail to enable selection of a sub-region within the selected region. The map includes a plurality of surface seismic data lines, each corresponding to a compressed seismic data file. Each of the compressed seismic data file is derived from and has less information content than its corresponding full seismic data file. Additionally, each of the compressed seismic data file contains a reference to its corresponding full seismic data file. A geophysical image corresponding to one of the compressed seismic data files is displayed by the computer system based on a selection of the corresponding surface seismic data line. The buyer can thus determine whether the full seismic data file corresponding displayed geophysical image is desirable for purchase.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> schematically illustrates a hardware environment for an embodiment of the present invention. A server computer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a reader <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for interacting with a data storage device <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> containing a full seismic data file. The server computer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> uses conversion and compression algorithms to create a compressed seismic data file. The server computer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> links the compressed seismic data file to a map display for a geographic area, and provides a reference from the compressed seismic data file to the full seismic data file. The compressed seismic data file, the map display, and the reference can then be placed on a computer readable medium <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For convenience, the computer readable medium <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be a removable media including but not limited to various optical formats (e.g., compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD), magneto-optical (MO) disk); magnetic formats (e.g., magnetic tape, magnetic disk, microdrive); or semiconductor formats (e.g., compact flash). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes a monitor <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (e.g., CRT, LCD display, etc.) and an input device <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (e.g., a mouse and/or a keyboard) for interacting with the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> also includes a device <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for reading a computer readable medium <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> manufactured in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the computer readable medium <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be a fixed medium within the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, such as a hard disk drive, which is capable of receiving data files for storage therein. The data files may thus be transmitted to the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> via a computer network <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for storage in the fixed medium. The server computer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be personal computers, workstations, minicomputers, or mainframes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The medium <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> contains a plurality of maps, having multiple levels of geographic detail. The maps include a plurality of surface seismic data lines that are visible and selectable when the map is viewed at a high level of detail. The medium <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> also contains a plurality of compressed seismic data files corresponding respectively to the surface seismic data lines. The compressed seismic data files are preferably image files for producing a geophysical display of a seismic cross-section along the surface seismic data line selected. Each of the compressed seismic data files contains a reference to a full seismic data file. In one embodiment, the reference is embedded in the compressed seismic data file and is visible in the geophysical display. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the files stored on the medium <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be stored in the form of Web pages. The broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> thus executes a Web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, for displaying the Web pages. Since the Web format is familiar to most users, the difficulties associated with learning and using a proprietary interface can be avoided. Of course, other formats may be used without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> An embodiment of the present invention is now described generally in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. A potential buyer (or licensee) of seismic data typically begins by making inquiries of a data broker. The data broker invites the buyer to the data broker&apos;s office, which contains a broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a computer readable medium <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> manufactured in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, operating in conjunction with the medium <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, presents the buyer with a map display. The map display contains multiple levels of detail, to allow the buyer to focus in on a particular geographic area of interest. As the map is displayed at higher levels of detail, surface seismic data lines become visible on the map display and can be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Selection of a surface seismic data line causes the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to produce a geophysical display from a compressed seismic data file. The buyer can then evaluate the geophysical display to determine the desirability of obtaining a full seismic data file and/or a high quality image corresponding thereto. By using a reference identifier associated with the compressed seismic data file, the broker can place an order for the full seismic data file, which contains the raw seismic data and is typically available on magnetic tape. The buyer can also opt to purchase a high quality image corresponding to the geophysical display, which is produced by processing the raw seismic data and is typically available as a hard copy print. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a flow diagram of the operation of the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> for enabling the buyer to select and purchase a full seismic data file. The process starts at step <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. To initiate the process, in step <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> reads a data file for a map display from the medium <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> then displays the map in step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The initial map displayed is usually at a low level of geographic detail, and may be an image of a country, or other large geographic area, such as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Then, in step <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> receives from the operator, who may be a buyer or a data broker, the selection of a particular region within the initial map. The broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> then displays the selected region at a higher level of geographic detail in step <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. For example, selection of a particular state within a country causes the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to display an image of the selected state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Then, in step <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> receives the selection of a sub-region within the region displayed. The broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> then displays the selected sub-region at a higher level of geographic detail in step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. At this level of detail, surface seismic data lines are visible. Each surface seismic data line corresponds to a compressed seismic data file stored on the medium <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and which represents the geologic structure underlying the seismic data line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> receives the selection of a surface seismic data line. In step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> retrieves the compressed seismic data file corresponding to the surface seismic data line selected. Then, in step <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> displays a geophysical image corresponding to the compressed seismic data file. In one embodiment, the compressed seismic data file is an image file that is stored on the medium <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in a compressed graphic format, such as GIF (graphics interchange format) or JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group). The compressed seismic data file is derived from and contains less information content than the corresponding full seismic data file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Once the buyer has studied the geophysical image, the buyer can decide whether to purchase the full seismic data file corresponding to the surface seismic data line displayed. In step <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> offers the buyer the option of purchasing the data. If the buyer agrees to purchase the data, the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> then records the reference corresponding to the surface seismic data line displayed in step <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and continues to step <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, where the selection of another surface seismic data line can be made. If, in step <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>, the buyer decides not to purchase the data, the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> continues directly to step <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> provides the buyer with the option of selecting another surface seismic data line and viewing a geophysical display corresponding thereto. If another selection is desired, the process then returns to step <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, wherein the initial map is read from the medium <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for display in step <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment, the process can simply return to step <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and display the sub-region that was previously selected to allow the buyer to select another surface seismic data line in step <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> If, in step <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, no further selection is required, the process continues to step <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> wherein a list of references corresponding to the surface seismic data lines selected is displayed. The buyer can, at this point, confirm the selection of the corresponding full seismic data files for purchase. The full seismic data files typically contain raw, unprocessed data as recorded by the seismic receivers. The full seismic data files, therefore, require substantial processing before they can be properly reviewed by seismic experts. At this point, the buyer can also be presented with the option to purchase a high resolution image of each of the selected surface seismic data lines. The high resolution image is similar to the geophysical display produced from the compressed seismic data files, but is available at a much higher resolution. Since the high resolution image has already been processed to some extent, the image can be directly reviewed by the seismic experts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Then, in step <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight>, the broker computer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> can place a purchase order for the full seismic data files and/or the high resolution images corresponding to the surface seismic data line. The process then ends in step <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a flow diagram for manufacturing a computer readable medium in accordance with the present invention. The process starts at step <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In step <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight>, a computer system receives a full seismic data file for processing. The full seismic data file contains data stored in a vector format, as originally recorded by the various seismic receivers at the time of the shot. The data is then subjected to extensive processing to determine the three-dimensional geologic structure underlying the surface seismic data line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Then, in step <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, once the data has been processed, a portion of the geologic structure (e.g., a two-dimensional image taken along the surface seismic data line) can be imaged and converted into a graphic format, such as a computer graphics metafile (CGM) format. In step <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight>, a compression program is used to compress and convert the data into another graphic format, such as the JPEG format. In one embodiment, another compression program is used to compress the JPEG data even further. A number of different compression programs may be employed as necessary. Alternatively, the same compression program may be repeatedly executed as necessary until the compressed seismic data file is within a predetermined file size. The compression program(s) are employed to produce a compressed seismic data file having a sufficiently small file size such that a large number of files may be placed on a single medium <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The use of lossy compression techniques and formats such as JPEG results in a compressed seismic data file having less information content than the original full seismic data file. Having less information content allows the size of the compressed seismic data file to be much smaller than the size of the full seismic data file. Less information content also allows the proprietary interests of the data owner to be protected. For example, while some useful knowledge may be gained from viewing the geophysical display formed from the compressed seismic data file, the amount of information available in the compressed seismic data file is still significantly less than would be available were the buyer to purchase the full seismic data file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Then, in step <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, a reference to the full seismic data file is provided. The reference can simply be embedded within the compressed seismic data file, for example, a serial number that is visible when viewing an image of the compressed seismic data file. Alternatively, the reference can be electronically associated with the compressed seismic data file, such that a program can read the reference and determine the corresponding full seismic data file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Then, in step <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight>, the compressed seismic data file is linked to a surface seismic data line. For example, a map having a surface seismic data line may be hyperlinked to the compressed seismic data file. Of course, other methods of linking the compressed seismic data file to the surface seismic data line are possible and are within the scope of the present invention. Selection of the corresponding surface seismic data line will thus result in a geophysical display from the compressed seismic data file. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In step <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, the compressed seismic data file and the reference are stored. Then, in step <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight>, the computer system determines whether there are more full seismic data files to be processed. If so, the process returns to step <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> wherein the next full seismic data file is received for processing. If there are no more full seismic data files, the process ends at step <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The compressed seismic data file and the reference can be stored in, for example, a hard disk drive, until all the data has been processed. Then, once all of the data corresponding to a particular geographic area has been processed, the maps (including the surface seismic data lines), the compressed seismic data files, and the references may be copied onto a computer readable medium for execution on a computer system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a partial listing of the contents of a computer readable medium in accordance with the present invention. In this embodiment, the files are formatted for use with a Web browser. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The file &ldquo;Index.htm&rdquo; is an introductory page, containing, for example, an identity of the data owner, along with an indication of the locations for which seismic data is available. Selection of a location invokes the file &ldquo;USA-Map.htm&rdquo; containing a map display file &ldquo;usa-colorjpg.&rdquo; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates a map of a geographic area that, in this embodiment, spans the contiguous United States. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Selection of a region on the map, the state of Oklahoma, for example, invokes the file &ldquo;OK.htm&rdquo; containing a map display file &ldquo;Okquads_A.jpg.&rdquo; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a map of the state of Oklahoma. The area is depicted at a higher level of detail than the previous map of the United States and includes geographic designations such as county names. Also illustrated in the map of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> are line markings for a plurality of sub-regions, also referred to as &ldquo;quadrangles&rdquo; or quads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Selection of a particular quad, in this example, &ldquo;Tangier,&rdquo; invokes the file &ldquo;tangier.htm&rdquo; containing a map display file &ldquo;tangier.jpg.&rdquo; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a map of the Tangier quadrangle. This geographic area is again depicted at a higher level of detail than the previous geographic areas. Additionally, a plurality of surface seismic data lines are visible on this image of the Tangier quadrangle, line 0-92 <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, line 0-90 <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, line 04-85 <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, line 0-3-85 <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, and line 0-89 <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Selection of a particular surface seismic data line, line 0-4-85 <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, for example, invokes the file &ldquo;240.jpg&rdquo; which is a compressed seismic data file. In this embodiment, the compressed seismic data file &ldquo;240.jpg&rdquo; produces the geophysical display illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Selection of different surface seismic data line will result in the display of, for example, the file &ldquo;239.jpg.&rdquo; Upon visual inspection of the geophysical display, the buyer can determine whether the full seismic data file corresponding to the compressed seismic data file is desirable for purchase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the geophysical display produced by the compressed seismic data file &ldquo;240.jpg&rdquo; includes references embedded therein. For example, on the left side of the seismic cross-section is information relating to the geographic location of the surface seismic data line. The information includes the country (USA), state (OK), quad (Tangier), and the particular line (O-4-85) within the quad. In this instance, the reference indication of the line includes the letter O, which again confirms that this surface seismic data line is located in the state of Oklahoma. Alternatively, the reference can be stored in an HTML or, preferably, an XML file that contains a link to the geophysical display. Placing the reference to the full seismic data file within an XML file allows another program to extract the information and, preferably, fill out a purchase order for the buyer based on the surface seismic data lines selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been fully described by way of examples and with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that various changes and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, unless such changes and modifications depart from the scope of the present invention, they should be construed as being included therein. </paragraph>
