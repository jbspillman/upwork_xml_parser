<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to hunting stands for hunting wildlife and in particular to a mobile hunting stand capable of providing a powered, elevated hunting platform that is easily raised or lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Hunters throughout the world routinely hunt various forms of wildlife, including deer, elk, feral hogs, bear, waterfowl, and many other animal species. Although the methods and equipment associated with hunting often vary depending on the particular animal being hunted, one element that is almost always required for successful hunting is the element of concealment. If a hunter does not remain concealed from his prey, either through the use of camouflage clothing and natural surroundings, or through the use of man-made structures such as hunting blinds, the hunter&apos;s odds of success decrease dramatically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Various types of hunting blinds and hunting stands have been developed to aid in the concealment of hunters. Blinds having tower structures that are capable of being towed behind a pickup track are generally known. Additionally, it is known to provide a vertically extendable and retractable platform on a trailer that is capable of being towed by a towing vehicle or an all terrain vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Despite the general availability of extendable and retractable hunting stands, these stands are often bulky and require enormous amounts of space for storing the frame components of the hunting stand when in a retracted position. Additionally, the mechanisms and frames built to provide extendability and retractability are often complicated and require excessive amounts of construction material, thereby making the hunting stand unduly expensive and heavy. Finally, it is often not feasible to transport an extendable and retractable blind on a trailer. Often the areas accessed by hunters is very remote and contains excessive brush and vegetation. In such areas, it is undesirable to tow a trailer behind a vehicle since the trailer will effectively limit the turning radius of the vehicle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A need exists, therefore, for an extendable and collapsible hunting stand that occupies a small amount of space in a fully collapsed position. A need also exists for such a hunting stand having simple frame components and lifting mechanisms in order to decrease costs and weight. Finally, a need exists for an extendable and collapsible hunting stand that can be easily transported and operated from the roof of a sport utility vehicle. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The problems presented in providing mobile, elevated platforms for hunting deer and other wildlife are solved by the systems and methods of the present invention. A preferred embodiment of the invention provides a collapsible and mobile lifting apparatus for raising a platform supporting persons and equipment to a desired height. In particular, the preferred embodiment provides that the hunting stand can be easily transported by either towing the stand behind a vehicle or by mounting the stand on the roof of a vehicle. According to the disclosed embodiments, the lifting apparatus is pneumatically or hydraulically powered. Because lifting cylinders are used to extend and collapse the collapsible frames, complex lifting mechanisms such as those requiring pulleys or gears are avoided. Further, the lifting apparatus is designed as a modular feature unit, so that it can be configured with more or fewer collapsible frames, depending on the desired height of the concealment enclosure. The preferred embodiment also allows the lifting apparatus to keep the concealment enclosure level as the concealment enclosure is raised and lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent with reference to the drawings and detailed description which follow. </paragraph>

Hunting stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> includes a base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and a lifting apparatus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is typically used to house a person while hunting deer or other wildlife. Hunters often refer to such a concealment enclosure as a &ldquo;hunting blind.&rdquo; Typically, concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> will have four walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> supported by a base <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, although more or fewer walls could be present. Window holes <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are generally cut at selected locations in the walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to allow the hunter to view and shoot at the animals that are being hunted. A door or access panel (not shown) is typically provided in one of the walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to allow entry to and exit from concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A roof <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is rigidly and securely fastened to walls <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to protect the hunter from the elements and further aid in concealment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, but also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in the drawings, lifting apparatus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is provided to raise and lower concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Lifting apparatus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> includes a first, or upper collapsible frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and a second, or lower collapsible frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. A first lifting cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is provided to move upper collapsible frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> between a collapsed position and an extended position. A second lifting cylinder <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is provided to move lower collapsible frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> between a collapsed position and an extended position. Together, lifting cylinders <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> provide the ability to move lifting apparatus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> between a fully collapsed position (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), in which both collapsible frames <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are in the collapsed position, and a fully extended position (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>), in which both collapsible frames are in the extended position. A plurality of intermediate positions, one of which is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, are attainable between the fully collapsed position and the fully extended position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, upper collapsible frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> includes a pair of lifting struts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, each lifting strut having a first end <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>. Upper collapsible frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> also includes a pair of support struts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, each support strut having a first end <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight>. The first ends of the lifting struts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the support struts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> are pivotally attached to a pair of lower longitudinal cross members <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Preferably, each lower longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> has one of the lifting struts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> attached at a lower lifting point <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and one of the support struts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> attached at a lower support point <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The second ends of the lifting struts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the support struts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> are pivotally attached to a pair of upper longitudinal cross members <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> in a similar fashion. Each of the upper longitudinal cross members <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> has one of the lifting struts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> attached at an upper lifting point <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and one of the support struts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> attached at an upper support point <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight>. For each pair of struts (one lifting strut <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and one support strut <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>) connected to the same upper longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>, the distance between the upper lifting point <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> and the upper support point <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> is equal to the distance between the lower lifting point <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and the lower support point <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. Additionally, all of the lifting struts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and support struts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of upper collapsible frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> are equal in length in that portion of the strut between the point of attachment to upper longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> and the point of attachment to lower longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> First lifting cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is pivotally attached at one end to lower longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and at another end to lifting strut <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Preferably, one first lifting cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is attached to each lifting strut <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>; however, it is possible that one first lifting cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> could be used to control the movement of upper collapsible frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Further, each lifting cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is preferably attached to lower longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> at a position that is out-of-line with and lower than lower lifting point <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and lower support point <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>. Each first lifting cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> is either hydraulically or pneumatically operated. A hose <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is fluidly attached to each first lifting cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> for providing compressed air or compressed hydraulic fluid to the lifting cylinder, depending on the type of lifting cylinder being used. Each hose <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is routed along the lower collapsible frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and is fluidly connected to a manifold <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. Manifold <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is fluidly associated with a valve <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, and is fluidly connected to one end of a supply hose <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. Preferably, supply hose <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> is fluidly connected at another end to a compressor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Compressor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is operably connected to a motor <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight> and supplies compressed air to manifold <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. By operating valve <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, compressed air is selectively supplied to each of the first lifting cylinders <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> through each of the hoses <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight>. In one alternative configuration, an air tank (not shown) containing compressed air could replace the compressor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and motor <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>. If first lifting cylinder <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> were hydraulically operated, the compressor would be replaced by a hydraulic pump (not shown). The hydraulic pump would pressurize hydraulic fluid, which would then be delivered through hoses <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> to operate the first lifting cylinders <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Lower collapsible frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> includes a pair of lifting struts <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, each lifting strut having a first end <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight>. Lower collapsible frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> also includes a pair of support struts <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, each support strut having a first end <highlight><bold>91</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>. The first ends of the lifting struts <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and the support struts <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> are pivotally attached to base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Preferably, each of the lifting struts <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> is attached to base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a base lifting point <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> and each of the support struts <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> is attached to base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at a base support point <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that, in each stage, both the upper and lower attachment points of the lifting struts and can be vertically offset from the upper and lower attachment points of the support struts so that the stage can fully collapse to a substantially flat position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The second ends of the lifting struts <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and the support struts <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> are pivotally attached to the pair of lower longitudinal cross members <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Each of the lower longitudinal cross members <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> has one of the lifting struts <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> attached at a lower lifting point <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and one of the support struts <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> attached at a lower support point <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. For each pair of struts (one lifting strut <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and one support strut <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>) connected to the same lower longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, the distance between lower lifting point <highlight><bold>109</bold></highlight> and lower support point <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is equal to the distance between base lifting point <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> and base support point <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Additionally, all of the lifting struts <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> and support struts <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> are equal in length in that portion of the strut between the point of attachment to lower longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> and the point of attachment to base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Second lifting cylinder <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is pivotally attached at one end to base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and at another end to lifting strut <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. Preferably, one second lifting cylinder <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is attached to each lifting strut <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>; however, it is possible that one second lifting cylinder <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> could be used to control the movement of lower collapsible frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Each second lifting cylinder <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> is either hydraulically or pneumatically operated. A hose (not shown) is fluidly attached to each second lifting cylinder <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> for providing compressed air or compressed hydraulic fluid to the lifting cylinder, depending on the type of lifting cylinder being used. Each hose is routed along the base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is fluidly connected to manifold <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. Manifold <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> is fluidly associated with a valve <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. As mentioned previously, supply hose <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> provides pressurized fluid to manifold <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight>. This fluid is selectively routed to each second lifting cylinder <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> by selectively operating valve <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It can be seen by one having skill in the art that valves <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> could be manual valves or electrically controllable valves having an associated controller (not shown). If electrically controllable valves are used, a transmitter and receiver can be employed to remotely control operation of the valves, thereby allowing concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to be raised and lowered from within concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> A plurality of lateral cross members <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and cross braces <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> are provided for both the upper collapsible frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the lower collapsible frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Preferably, each pair of support struts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> are strengthened by rigidly attaching lateral cross members <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> between the support struts as demonstrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Each pair of lifting struts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> are strengthened by rigidly attaching lateral cross members <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and cross braces <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> between the lifting struts. In a preferred embodiment, lateral cross members <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and cross braces <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> are attached to the other frame members by welding. Depending on the particular design and size of lifting apparatus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, the placement and number of lateral cross members <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> and cross braces <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> could vary. In one embodiment, lateral cross members <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> could be positioned to serve as steps for a hunter who desires to enter or exit concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> when lifting apparatus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is in a fully extended position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that lateral cross members <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> are also rigidly attached between each pair of support struts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> at both ends of the support struts <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>. Similarly, lateral cross members <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> are rigidly attached between each pair of lifting struts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> at both ends of the lifting struts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>. While it was previously mentioned in this description that each strut is pivotally attached to a longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> or base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the pivotal attachment of each strut may be accomplished by pivotally attaching the lateral cross member <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> to the longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> or base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Since the struts are rigidly attached to lateral cross members <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> at each end of the strut, the pivotal attachment of these lateral cross members <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> to longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> or base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> would effectively provide the same functionality as if the strut itself were pivotally attached to longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> or base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is rigidly attached to upper longitudinal cross members <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight>. In one configuration, base <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> would be rigidly attached to upper longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> using fasteners or by welding. In another configuration, base <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be integral to upper longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> such that the second ends of struts <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> are pivotally attached to the base <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> of concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> trailer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is provided to transport, house, and support hunting stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Trailer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> includes a chassis <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, walls <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight>, and a floor <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. The number and material composition of walls <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> could vary. When lifting device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is in the fully collapsed position (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), walls <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> are of equal or greater height than the collapsed lifting device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The walls <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> act to protect and conceal the lifting device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> when the lifting device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is in the fully collapsed position. Preferably, base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, upon which lifting device <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is mounted, is integral to floor <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>. Trailer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> also includes a trailer tongue <highlight><bold>137</bold></highlight> having a ball hitch <highlight><bold>139</bold></highlight> for towing behind an automobile or an all terrain vehicle (ATV). Retractable leveling jacks <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> are attached at each comer of the chassis <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> for stabilizing the trailer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> during operation of lifting apparatus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> in the drawings, an alternative embodiment is illustrated in which an automobile carrier <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> is provided to transport, house, and support hunting stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Automobile carrier <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> is rigidly mounted to a roof of a sport utility vehicle (SUV) <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> or in a bed of a pickup truck (not shown). Automobile carrier <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> includes walls <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> and a floor (not shown) similar to those on trailer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. Walls <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> are as low profile as possible to prevent excessive drag during operation of SUV <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. Depending on the type of lifting cylinders used, the compressor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, the air tank, or the hydraulic pump may be mounted to the body of SUV <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>. If compressor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> or the hydraulic pump is used, an engine that powers SUV <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> may also be used to provide power to compressor <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> or the hydraulic pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> in the drawings, a modular feature of the present invention is illustrated. In the event that it is desired to raise concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to a greater height, additional collapsible frames can be added to increase the fully extendable height of lifting apparatus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, an additional lower collapsible frame <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> and an additional upper collapsible frame <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> can be attached above the upper collapsible frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The interconnections and operations of the lower and upper collapsible frames <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> are similar to those for upper and lower collapsible frames <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. One difference, however, is that the struts <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight> of lower collapsible frame <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> are no longer attached at their first ends to base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Instead the first ends of the struts are pivotally attached to a pair of longitudinal joining members <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> that are similar in structure to lower longitudinal cross members <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Longitudinal joining member <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight> replaces each upper longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> at the second ends of the struts of upper collapsible frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Upper longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> is instead pivotally connected to the second ends of the struts of upper collapsible frame <highlight><bold>157</bold></highlight> (similar to the connection in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In operation, hunting stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is transported to an area in which a hunter desires to hunt or observe animals or terrain. If hunting stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is configured in a trailer configuration, as in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, the hunting stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is transported by towing the trailer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> behind an automobile or ATV. Preferably, hunting stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is transported in a fully collapsed position. Upon arrival at a selected location, hunting stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be used either with the trailer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> attached to the vehicle or unattached. In either case, trailer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is secured by extending leveling jacks <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight>. Leveling jacks <highlight><bold>141</bold></highlight> essentially widen the &ldquo;footprint&rdquo; of trailer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, thereby adding stability as lifting apparatus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is raised. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> If hunting stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is configured in an automobile carrier configuration, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, hunting stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is transported on top of SUV <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight> or in the bed of a pickup without the need for a trailer. Hunting stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> can be operated from the roof of SUV <highlight><bold>147</bold></highlight>, or the automobile carrier <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> can be removed from the roof and placed on a flat surface such as the ground. If removed from the vehicle, leveling jacks (not shown) similar to those used with trailer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> would be employed to stabilize hunting stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> during use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> A hunter wishing to hunt from concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> raises the concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the desired height. As mentioned previously, remote control operation of valves <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> can be provided. If remote operability is provided, the hunter can enter the concealment enclosure while hunting stand <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is in the fully collapsed position (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), and then raise himself and the concealment enclosure to the fully extended position (or a plurality of intermediate positions). If remote operability is not provided, the hunter must manually operate valves <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to raise concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to the desired height. Then, the hunter can climb into the concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> by using lateral cross members <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> as steps. Although concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be occupied by a hunter and used in one of the intermediate positions, it is preferred that each collapsible frame be in the extended position to minimize the amount of force required from lifting cylinders <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> to support the collapsible frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Operation of valves <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>, whether by remote or manually, allows pressurized fluid (either compressed air or hydraulic fluid) to be supplied to lifting cylinders <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Each valve provides individual control over a pair of lifting cylinders. For example, valve <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> controls the supply of pressurized fluid to the pair of first lifting cylinders <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, and valve <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> controls the supply of pressurized fluid to the pair of second lifting cylinders <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. Since these pairs of lifting cylinders are operated independently, there is the ability to completely extend one of the collapsible frames, while keeping the other collapsible frame or frames in a collapsed position. However, it is desirable, when raising concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, to keep the weight of concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and lifting apparatus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> properly distributed with respect to base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in the drawings, a preferred method of raising concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is illustrated. A longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> associated with lower longitudinal cross member <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> bisects the points of attachment for upper collapsible frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> and the points of attachment for lower collapsible frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. An angle &agr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is formed between longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and struts of the upper collapsible frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. An angle &agr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is formed between longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>165</bold></highlight> and struts of the lower collapsible frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. While raising concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> with lifting apparatus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, it is preferable to insure that angle &agr;<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is substantially equal to angle &agr;<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. By raising each collapsible frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in coordination with the other, it is possible to keep the weight of concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and its occupants distributed over the portion of base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> where lower collapsible frame <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> attaches, thereby allowing easier lifting of concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and a more stable weight distribution with respect to trailer <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> or automobile carrier <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As lifting apparatus <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is used to raise concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the concealment enclosure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> remains substantially level in relation to base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This result is due to the equal lengths of the struts of each collapsible frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and the equal distances between the attachment points at the ends of each strut. By insuring that the length of each strut is equal to the length of other struts within that particular collapsible frame <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, and by insuring that the distance between attachment points at one end of a pair of struts is equal to the distance between attachment points at the other end of that pair of struts, the rotational orientation of the concealment enclosure with respect to base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will remain relatively constant throughout the raising and lowering process (i.e. the concealment enclosure will remain level). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Even though many of the examples discussed herein are applications of the present invention in the sport of hunting, the present invention also can be used in association with other sports and activities. One skilled in the art will see that the present invention can be applied in many areas where there is a need to provide an elevated platform for observation or accomplishing a task. The present invention could elevate a photographer desiring to have a concealed and elevated view of terrain and wildlife. A forest ranger could use the present invention as a mobile elevation platform for checking for the presence of forest fires. The invention could also be used by military personnel needing a compact and mobile platform for obtaining intelligence on terrain or enemy positions. The invention could also be used as mobile scaffolding in order to provide a work surface for a worker such as a painter, carpenter, welder, or window washer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A primary advantage of the present invention is that the invention provides a collapsible and mobile lifting apparatus for raising a platform supporting persons and equipment to a desired height. Another advantage of the present invention is that the hunting stand can be easily transported by either towing the stand behind a vehicle or by mounting the stand on the roof of a vehicle. Another advantage of the present invention is that the lifting apparatus is pneumatically or hydraulically powered. Because lifting cylinders are used to extend and collapse the collapsible frames, complex lifting mechanisms such as those requiring pulleys or gears are avoided. Another advantage of the present invention is the modular feature of the lifting apparatus. The lifting apparatus can be configured with more or fewer collapsible frames, depending on the desired height of the concealment enclosure. Another advantage of the present invention is the ability of the lifting apparatus to keep the concealment enclosure level as the concealment enclosure is raised and lowered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It should be apparent from the foregoing that an invention having significant advantages has been provided. While the invention is shown in only one of its forms, it is not just limited but is susceptible to various changes and modifications without departing from the spirit thereof. </paragraph>
