<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> (1) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a method of metallization in the fabrication of integrated circuits, and more particularly, to a method of preventing oxide erosion in a tungsten plug process in the manufacture of integrated circuits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> (2) Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In a typical tungsten plug process, openings are etched in a dielectric layer to contact underlying semiconductor device regions. A metal layer, such as tungsten or aluminum, is deposited over the dielectric layer and within the openings. The excess metal over the dielectric layer may be polished away using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Usually, the dielectric layer is an oxide layer. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> illustrates tungsten filled openings through an oxide layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> overlying a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In section A, an isolated tungsten plug is shown. Section B shows a dense plug area. Tungsten <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are to be polished away over the oxide layer to leave tungsten plugs only within the openings. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> illustrates the device after chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Plug dishing C occurs in the isolated plug area A. Both plug dishing and oxide erosion D occur in the dense plug area B. Oxide erosion control is a challenge unique to the tungsten chemical mechanical polishing planarization process because 1) high oxide erosion brings about difficulties in subsequent lithography and etch steps and 2) high oxide erosion is a major cause of contact/via seam exposure as device sizes shrink to sub-quarter-micron technology. This exposure degrades electrical performance. Currently, major efforts on oxide erosion have focused on slurry composition, pad hardness, and process parameter optimization (e.g. platen speed and carrier down-force, etc.). Only limited improvement is gained from these methods. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 6,001,730 to Farkas et al teaches a two-step CMP of copper where a tantalum nitride barrier layer also acts as a polish stop. This barrier layer must be removed to avoid short circuiting. Removal of the barrier layer will cause oxide erosion. U.S. Pat. No. 6,057,602 to Hudson et al uses a low friction material such as graphitic carbon in polishing tungsten to reduce oxide loss at the field oxide area. There is no evidence that this graphitic carbon can help to reduce oxide erosion in the dense metal plug area. U.S. Pat. No. 6,071,809 to Zhao shows a double polish stop of silicon dioxide over silicon nitride in polishing metal including tungsten and copper. U.S. Pat. No. 6,048,796 to Wang et al teaches a silicon nitride protective layer over oxide. After CMP of a copper and barrier metal layer, the protective layer prevents penetration of the oxide layer by conductive particles left after CMP. U.S. Pat. No. 5,385,867 to Ueda et al discloses the use of a barrier layer as polish stop in the CMP of Al&mdash;Cu&mdash;Si. Removal of the conductive barrier layer causes oxide erosion. Co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/442,493 to S. Gupta et al filed on Nov. 19, 1999 teaches using a silicon nitride diffusion step layer in a copper plug process. In the case of direct copper etch, the silicon nitride is an etch stop layer. In the case of dual damascene, silicon nitride is deposited on the oxide surface with the copper trench exposed after copper CMP. The silicon nitride layer is used to prevent copper from diffusing into the oxide. Allowed U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/110,419 to R. R. Sudipto filed on Jul. 6, 1998 teaches the use of a titanium nitride polish stop layer in a tungsten plug process. Again, when the titanium nitride layer is removed, oxide erosion will occur. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring now more particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is illustrated a portion of a partially completed integrated circuit device. There is shown a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, preferably composed of monocrystalline silicon. A pre-metal dielectric (PMD) or intermetal dielectric (IMD) layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is deposited on the substrate wafer. Semiconductor devices structures, such as gate electrodes, source and drain regions, or metal interconnects, not shown, may be formed in and on the semiconductor substrate and covered by the PMD or IMD layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Refer also to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> flowchart of the steps of the inventive process. Step <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is the formation of de ice structures or metal interconnects within layer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The PMD or IMD layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> typically comprises oxide, such as sub-atmospheric borophosphosilicate glass (SABPSG), phosphosilicate glass (PSG), plasma-enhanced tetraethoxysilane (PE-TEOS) oxide, silicon rich oxide (SRO), or their combinations. This deposition is the oxide deposition of step <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The PMD or IMD layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is planarized, such as by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), step <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Now, in a key process step of the present invention, a silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is deposited over the planarized oxide layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> and as step <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is deposited to a thickness of between about 200 and 1500 Angstroms. The silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will act as a polish stop in a subsequent step to prevent oxide erosion. Alternatively, silicon oxynitride or a combination of silicon nitride and silicon oxynitride can be used as the polish stop layer. It is important that the polish stop layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> be non-conductive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and step <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, openings <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are etched through the polish stop layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into the PMD or IMD layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The opening may be made to an underlying semiconductor device structure, such as a gate electrode, source or drain region, or metal line, not shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> and step <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, a barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is deposited over the polish stop layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and within the openings <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The barrier metal layer may comprise, for example, titanium and titanium nitride, and may have a thickness of between about 100 and 1000 Angstroms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A metal layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed over the barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The metal layer may be tungsten or aluminum which will form the metal via plugs. The metal layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may be deposited by any of the conventional means, including physical or chemical vapor deposition. The excess metal layer over the PMD or IMD layer is polished off by chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> and step <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The barrier metal layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is also removed by the CMP step. The silicon nitride polish stop layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> acts as a stop layer for the polishing process to prevent erosion of the underlying oxide <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> This completes formation of metal plug <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. The silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be removed by the oxide buffing step <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The oxide buffing step will not cause oxide erosion. Alternatively, the silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be retained. If retained, the silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can act as an etch stop layer for subsequent metal etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> second metal layer, such as titanium/titanium nitride and aluminum, may be sputter deposited over the surface of the substrate. The second metal layer is patterned to form metal lines <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The silicon nitride layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> acts as an etch stop layer during this patterning. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">EXAMPLE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The following example is given to show the important features of the invention and to aid in the understanding thereof. Variations may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Experiments were performed to determine oxide erosion after tungsten CMP in areas of high plug density, such as that illustrated on the righthand side of the FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The process of the present invention using a silicon nitride capping layer was compared to a process wherein no silicon nitride capping layer was used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates the oxide erosion in a device having a tungsten plug density of 0.36 &mgr;m between plugs and a plug diameter of 0.36 &mgr;m. Line <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> illustrates the oxide erosion of about 1250 Angstroms for the case where no silicon nitride cap was used. Line <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> illustrates the oxide erosion of about 300 Angstroms in the process of the present invention using the silicon nitride cap. This graph shows that the silicon nitride capping layer of the present invention significantly reduces oxide erosion in areas with high plug density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The process of the present invention provides a method for preventing oxide erosion and thinning, consequently achieving better planarity and improving plug seam exposure issues. The silicon nitride polish stop layer of the invention provides a simple and effective solution to the oxide erosion problem in the metal plug process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to the preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</paragraph>
