<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A hot swappable electronic component or module is provided that has non-staggered connectors (i.e., of equal length or depth), but which is configured to ensure that power, signal or other connectors are electrically coupled in a desired order. The electronic component includes a switch (e.g., a field effect transistor) having a gate coupled to a ground line that is configured for coupling to a ground reference of the interface with which the component is mated. A source of the switch is coupled to a voltage input (e.g., power, Vcc) and a drain is coupled to an internal component load or circuit. Until the gate is coupled to ground, the switch remains open, thereby preventing spurious signals or feedback of damaging current to the interface. When the gate is coupled to ground, the switch is closed and the internal load or circuit is energized. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to the fields of electronics and computer systems. More particularly, an apparatus is provided for enabling an electronic module having non-staggered connector contacts to be installed live or hot (e.g., during operation of the system in which it is installed). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An electronic module or peripheral device that can be inserted or replaced in a system (e.g., a computer system) while the system is operating, or is live, may be considered hot swappable. The use of such modules allows the system to continue operation even while a failed module is replaced, thus limiting the amount of time that the system is unavailable due to maintenance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Typical hot swappable components include signal connectors (e.g., pins, sockets) designed to mate with compatible connectors of an interface module, mid-plane assembly or system interface. The signal connectors thus provide for electrical connection between the circuitry of the component and corresponding circuitry of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> When the various circuits or circuit elements of a hot swappable component need to be connected or powered up in a particular sequence, the component is typically configured with staggered connectors. In other words, connectors for different signal lines or circuits may be of different lengths or depths, so that when the component is mated with the system the connectors make contact in the desired sequence. In particular, a ground connector may be longer than a power or input/output connector so that a ground reference is established before the component is energized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The use of staggered connectors requires the hot swappable component and/or the system interface to which the component mates, to be specially configured to provide or allow for connectors of varying lengths. However, some interfaces or connector assemblies that may be used with a hot swappable component may employ uniformly sized connectors. Or, staggered connectors may be unavailable, unusable or not feasible for the component. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Thus, in one embodiment of the invention an apparatus is provided for an electronic module or component having non-staggered connectors, to ensure that the module is connected or energized in a desired sequence. The apparatus may include one or more circuit elements configured to ensure a first connection (e.g., ground) is made before a second connection (e.g., power) is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the invention, an electronic module that is hot swappable, or to be inserted in a system while the system is live, is configured with a switch. The switch may comprise a mechanical switch or a solid-state switch such as a FET (Field Effect Transistor). A switch gate is coupled to ground and the switch therefore remains open until a ground connection is made between the module and the system. The switch is then closed and a connection between a source (e.g., power, Vcc) and the module&apos;s internal load or circuitry can be completed. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and is provided in the context of particular applications of the invention and their requirements. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the scope of the present invention. Thus, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown, but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The program environment in which a present embodiment of the invention is executed illustratively incorporates a general-purpose computer or a special purpose device such as a hand-held computer. Details of such devices (e.g., processor, memory, data storage, display) may be omitted for the sake of clarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention an apparatus is provided for ensuring that lines or circuits of a hot swappable electronic module with non-staggered electrical connectors (i.e., connectors of substantially uniform length) are connected or energized in a desired sequence. The electronic module may comprise a peripheral component (e.g., storage device, input/output device), an assembly of electronic devices or circuits, an internal computer system module, and so on. The module may interface with (e.g., connect to) any portion of a computer or other system. The module is hot swappable in that it may be inserted or replaced while the system is live. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Because the module&apos;s connectors are of uniform length or depth, the desired sequence of signal/power connections is ensured through the use of a switching element within the module. Until a first connection is made (e.g., for ground), the switch remains open. When closed, a second connection (e.g., power, Vcc) is completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an electronic module that, due to its non-staggered connectors, may subject the module or another component to damaging electrical current or erroneous signals. Illustratively, electronic module <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is a computer system component that requires power (e.g., &plus;12V) to drive a load (e.g., a fan, a display, a peripheral device) and which provides or exchanges information with the system through a data line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, module <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is configured to interface with system interface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which may, illustratively, be a mid-plane assembly. Multiple connections are made between module <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and interface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>; only a subset of those connections may be depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In particular, interface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> provides power connection <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, Vcc connection (e.g., &plus;5V) <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, ground connection <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and input/output connection <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Electronic module <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes power input connection <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, Vcc input connection <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, ground connection <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and input/output connection <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. Each connection presents a connector of uniform length/depth for mating with the corresponding connectors of system interface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. Thus, each of power connector <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, Vcc connector <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, ground connector <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and input/output connector <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are of the same length. The connectors of module <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be male or female. The connectors of interface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and/or module <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be combined in a unified, blindmate or other similar unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Equivalent circuits <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> are shown in module <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and may represent various types and configurations of actual circuits. Input/output line <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> may be coupled to an internal circuit or may be coupled to ground <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. For example, if input/output line <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is merely used to inform the system as to whether module <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is connected or not (e.g., it just provides a presence indication), then the input/output line may simply be connected to ground <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> in order to drive the line to a logic low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Because the connectors of module <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> (and system interface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>) are non-staggered, there is no physical restriction or control over which of the connections (e.g., power, Vec, ground, input/output) is made first. As one skilled in the art will appreciate, this may cause spurious signals to be returned to the system or may cause damage to the system, system interface <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and/or electronic module <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. For example, if the input/output connection is made first, an out of voltage signal may be propagated to the system. Or, if the power and input/output lines are connected before ground, a dangerous level of current could be returned to the system and cause damage to, or destroy, a system component. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts an electronic module having non-staggered connectors, which is configured in accordance with an embodiment of the invention to allow it to be hot swappable and control the order in which power, signal and/or other connections are completed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Module <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> includes power line <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, coupled to power connector <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, for providing power to the module. Module <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> also includes Vcc line <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> (coupled to Vcc connector <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), ground <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> (coupled to ground connector <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and input/output line <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> (coupled to input/output connector <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>). The various connectors of module <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are intended to be coupled with corresponding connectors of power line <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, Vcc line <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, ground reference <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> and input/output line <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of system interface <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, input/output line <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> provides a &ldquo;present&rdquo; signal to system interface <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> when the electronic module and system interface are mated, and may include appropriate elements (e.g., a rectifier) to prevent the input/output line from going lower than ground. In other embodiments, input/output line <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> may be coupled to circuitry within module <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and may be used to carry data between the module and the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Connectors <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are of uniform length or depth, and so there is no physical control over which of these connectors makes first contact with its corresponding connector of system interface <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. To ensure that the power and Vcc inputs are energized or coupled to their internal circuits, switches <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> are incorporated into module <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Although switches are included on both power and Vcc lines in the illustrated embodiment, in other embodiments one of them may be omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Gates of switches <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> are coupled to ground <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>, thereby keeping the switches open until ground <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is coupled to ground reference <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> demonstrates one configuration of a switch, such as switch <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, according to one embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, switch <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is a solid-state switch or a FET (Field Effect Transistor). As described above, gate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> of switch <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is coupled to ground, while source <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is coupled to power (or Vcc). Drain <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is coupled to an internal circuit of the module comprising switch <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Resistor <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may provide on the order of 22 kilohms of resistance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Until gate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is coupled to ground the voltage drop between gate <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> and source <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> (i.e., VGS) is 0 volts, and therefore the resistance across the switch (i.e., RDS) is very high and switch <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> remains open. When, however, the gate is coupled to ground (e.g., the module&apos;s ground connector is coupled to a ground reference of a system interface), VGS becomes &plus;/&minus;12 volts, for example, RDS drops to a low resistance, and switch <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> closes. An internal circuit or load is then safely powered. In the illustrated embodiment, switch <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be capable of handling approximately 5A of current without being damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The foregoing descriptions of embodiments of the invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description only. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the forms disclosed. Accordingly, the above disclosure is not intended to limit the invention; the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
