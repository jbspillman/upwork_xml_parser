More particularly, the disclosure relates to a system and method for simplifying the process with which an administrator facilitates this access. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Oftentimes, service providers offer access to certain resources to remote clients in exchange for a fee. For instance, some service providers permit clients to access high speed computers maintained by the service provider for predetermined lengths of time to conduct computations that more conventional computers lack the capacity and/or speed to complete efficiently. Typically, access is provided to the clients through various network connections. Therefore, for example, a client may send data (typically in packet form) to the service provider via the networks, and then receive the modified data resulting from the computations again via the networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In order for data to travel between two or more networks, there must be an effective path between the networks. Typically, this path is selected from multiple possible paths over a complex array of network devices (e.g., switches, routers, links, bridges, etc.). The nature of an effective path is normally dependent upon the various configurations of the network devices used in the two networks. These devices are arranged such that multiple possible paths exist so as to provide redundant communication paths, thereby increasing the likelihood that uninterrupted communications can be achieved. In the service provision scenario, however, critical gateways are normally used to create a single point of control over access to restricted resources so that greater security can be maintained by the service provider. In such a scenario, access to the resources basically equates to connectivity to the service provider network or networks that comprise these resources. In other words, to gain access is to become connected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Typically, the service provider uses several operators or administrators that provide connectivity, and therefore grant access, to the service provider resources. In that the various clients that access the resources may use different network configurations, the administrator must be able to facilitate connectivity for different types of networks. Although connectivity can be provided for substantially any network configuration, the process of establishing this connectivity can be different for each. Therefore, the administrator must be trained to recognize the various network configurations of the clients and must be able to facilitate their connectivity. Unfortunately, it can be difficult for service providers to find, as well as retain, administrators with these skills. Even when such persons can be located and retained, their training and/or their salaries can be quite expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Although graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have been developed for simplifying the administrator&apos;s control over connectivity so that less skilled administrators can be utilized, existing GUIs distinguish between the different connectivity methods for the various network configurations. Therefore, the administrators still must know how to manipulate the GUI for each connectivity situation. In addition, in that the method used is normally different for each different network configuration, there are many opportunities for mistakes to be made by the administrator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> From the foregoing, it can be appreciated that it would be desirable to have a simplified system and method for controlling access to a resource. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring now in more detail to the drawings, in which like numerals indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for providing access to a resource. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can comprise several different networks including a service provider network <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, one or more client networks <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and a wide area network (WAN) <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> through which connectivity between the client networks and the service provider network can be established. Although a particular arrangement of networks is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it is to be understood that this arrangement is merely exemplary in nature and that many other arrangements are feasible and could be used to facilitate connectivity. Moreover, although single networks are illustrated, persons having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that one or more of these networks can comprise two or more sub-networks (i.e., subnets). As is discussed in more detail below, the configuration of the client networks <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can vary such that different methods are required to establish connectivity between the individual client networks and the service provider network <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are one or more resources <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> that are connected to the service provider network <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and that, under the control of the service provider, can be accessed by the various clients. By way of example, these resources <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can comprise high speed computers. It will be appreciated, however, that the resources <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> can comprise substantially any resource that a client may wish to remotely access and use. Connected to the client networks <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are computing devices (e.g., servers) <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that are used by the clients to transmit data to and receive data from the service provider network <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and, more particularly, one or more of the service provider resources <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, one or more such computing devices <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be connected to each client network <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Shown connected to the service provider network <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the WAN <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is a service provider computing device <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> that, by way of example, can also comprise a server. As is described in detail below, the computing device <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> can be operated by a service provider administrator (or other person) so as to grant or deny clients access to the provider network <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the resources <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> connected thereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a schematic view illustrating an example architecture for the service provider computing device <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the computing device <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> generally comprises a processing device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, memory <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, at least one user interface device <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, and at least one network interface device <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, each of which is connected to a local interface <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that, by way of example, comprises one or more internal and/or external buses. The processing device <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comprises hardware for executing software that is stored in the memory <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and can include, for example, a central processing unit (CPU) or an auxiliary processor among several processors associated with the computing device <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a semiconductor based microprocessor (in the form of a microchip), or a macroprocessor. The memory <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can include any one of combination of volatile memory elements (e.g., random access memory (RAM, such as DRAM, SRAM, etc.)) and nonvolatile memory elements (e.g., ROM, hard drive, tape, CDROM, etc.). Moreover, the memory <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> can incorporate electronic, magnetic, optical, and/or other types of storage media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The one or more user interface devices <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> can include those tools normally used to communicate with a computing device such as a server including, for instance, a keyboard, mouse, and display. The one or more network interface devices <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> comprise the various hardware with which the computing device <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> transmits and receives data over the networks. By way of example, the network interface devices <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> can include a modulator/demodulator (e.g., modem), an RF or other transceiver, a telephonic interface, a bridge, a router, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the memory <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> comprises various software programs. In particular, the memory <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> includes an operating system <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, a control module <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, and a connectivity module <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. The operating system <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> controls the execution of other software, such as the control module <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and connectivity module <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, and provides scheduling, input-output control, file and data management, memory management, and communication control and related services. As described in more detail below, the control module <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is adapted to present the user (e.g., service provider administrator) with a graphical user interface (GUI) with which the user can operate the connectivity module <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> which facilitates connectivity between the client networks <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and the service provider resources <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. As described below, the GUI presented to the user is configured such that connectivity can be provided through the same on screen process, regardless of the client network configuration. Connectivity is attained by the connectivity module <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> with reference to data stored in the connectivity database <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> of the memory <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Various software has been described herein. It is to be understood that this software can be stored on any computer readable medium for use by or in connection with any computer related system or method. In the context of this document, a computer readable medium is an electronic, magnetic, optical, or other physical device or means that can contain or store a computer program for use by or in connection with a computer-related system or method. The software can be embodied in any computer-readable medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device, such as a computer-based system, processor-containing system, or other system that can fetch the instructions from the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device and execute the instructions. In the context of this document, a &ldquo;computer-readable medium&rdquo; can be any means that can store, communicate, propagate, or transport the software for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The computer readable medium can be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. More specific examples (a nonexhaustive list) of the computer-readable medium include an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM, EEPROM, or Flash memory), an optical fiber, and a portable compact disc read-only memory (CDROM). Note that the computer-readable medium can even be paper or another suitable medium upon which a program is printed, as the program can be electronically captured, via for instance optical scanning of the paper or other medium, then compiled, interpreted or otherwise processed in a suitable manner if necessary, and then stored in a computer memory. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As identified above, it would be desirable for a user (e.g., service provider administrator) to have a tool with which connectivity can be established in a more simple manner irrespective of the configuration of the client network. More specifically, it would be desirable to have a tool with which connectivity can be established in an at least partially automated process such that highly skilled users are not needed. Such operation is provided by the control module <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> and connectivity module <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. The control module <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> generates an application that uses a control GUI that is operated by the user in the same manner regardless of the particular network configuration the client is using. An example GUI <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. This GUI <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> (entitled &ldquo;VLAN Pilot&rdquo;) is used to enable connectivity for one or more clients. For instance, the GUI <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can be used to construct virtual local area networks (VLANs) through with connectivity can be provided to one or more clients. Alternatively, the GUI <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can provide similar connectivity without creating a VLAN by renumbering an existing but disconnected VLAN to a VLAN number for which connectivity was previously enabled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the GUI <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can have a look and feel common to Windows-type software programs to present a familiar format to the user. The GUI <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> can include a &ldquo;Modify VLANs&rdquo; folder <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> that is specifically configured for modifying the service provider formulated VLANs. Although other such folders can be provided, they are not shown or described herein as being beyond the scope of this disclosure. As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the Modify VLANs folder <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> can comprise a &ldquo;Customer&rdquo; window <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and a &ldquo;Free Pool&rdquo; window <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. As described below, the Customer window <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is used to identify VLANs that have been created for particular clients, and to identify to which resources those clients have access. In the example configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the Customer window includes a &ldquo;VLANs&rdquo; subwindow <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> that identifies the VLANs that have been created, and a &ldquo;Resources&rdquo; subwindow <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> that identifies the resources associated with the VLANs. In addition, the Customer window <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> can include a &ldquo;New VLAN&rdquo; button <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> that, as is described below, is used to create new VLANs for clients. The &ldquo;Free Pool&rdquo; window <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is used to identify the resources that are available for use by a client. By way of example, this window <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> can include a &ldquo;Resources&rdquo; subfolder <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> that includes a resources subwindow <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> that lists the available resources. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates an example mode of operation of the control module <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. More particularly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates the manner in which access to (i.e., connectivity with) one or more service provider resources <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is controlled through manipulation of a GUI such as GUI <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. As indicated in block <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, the control module <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is first initiated and, as indicated in block <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the control module presents the administrator with a control GUI, such as GUI <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Once the GUI is presented, the control module <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> is prepared to receive connectivity instructions from the administrator. If, for instance, a client contracts with the service provider for a predetermined duration of access to a resource (e.g., high speed computer), the administrator can be notified that client is to be provided with this access. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> At this point, the administrator can enable connectivity for the client so the client will be able to access the service provider resource(s). With reference to the example GUI <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the VLAN can be created by first selecting the New VLAN button <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. Selection of this button <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> can generate a pop-up box (not shown) in which the user can select a client, e.g., from a pull-down menu of the service provider&apos;s clients, for which a VLAN is to be created. Once the client is selected, the newly created VLAN can be displayed in the VLANs subwindow <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> under the name of the client. By way of example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows two client VLANs have been created, one for &ldquo;Client 1&rdquo; and another for &ldquo;Client 2.&rdquo; Once the client VLAN has been &ldquo;created&rdquo; in this manner, the administrator can select the resources to which the client will be given access. This can be accomplished by selecting resources from the resources subwindow <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and associating them with the particular client. For instance, the administrator can &ldquo;drag&rdquo; each desired resource from the resources subwindow <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> and &ldquo;drop&rdquo; them on the particular client listed in the VLANs subwindow <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. Persons having ordinary skill will appreciate that other typical GUI manipulations can be used, if desired. As indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, &ldquo;Client 1&rdquo; (highlighted) has been provided access to &ldquo;Computer 1&rdquo; as indicated in the Resources subwindow <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> With reference back to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the administrator selections are received, as indicated in block <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, either continually as they are entered or at once after all selections have been made. In either case, the administrator selections are communicated by the control module <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> to the connectivity module <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> such that the VLAN can actually be created for the client and connectivity established, as indicated in block <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>. Preferably, this connectivity is established automatically under the control of various software contained within the connectivity module <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an example mode of operation of the connectivity module <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> in establishing this connectivity. As indicated in block <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, the connectivity module <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is first initiated. Normally, such initiation occurs in response to the communication from the control module <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> identified above. From this communication, the connectivity module <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> can identify who the client is and which resources are to be made available to the client, as indicated in block <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As mentioned above, it is important to know who the client is in facilitating connectivity in that each client may operate a differently configured network <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and therefore may require a different connectivity method. In that, to maintain the simplicity of the GUI, the network configuration is not identified to the administrator, the connectivity module <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> must determine what network configuration the client uses, as indicated in block <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>. With regard to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, this determination can be made with reference to a correlation chart <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> stored within the connectivity database <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> which crosses the client name (or a code associated with the client) with the connectivity method used for the each client&apos;s network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Once the network configuration has been determined, connectivity can be established for the client, as indicated in block <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. As is known in the art, a variety of connectivity methods are currently available and many others are being developed. For instance, in a simplified arrangement, connectivity can be established by the generation of a problem ticket that is issued through a workflow management system to a human being that physically plugs the client connector into the appropriate access device (e.g., switch) to provide service to the client. In another arrangement, where the client is statically connected to a VLAN switch port within the service provider network <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the VLAN switch is normally configured to isolate this client port, the VLAN switch can be reconfigured (e.g., through commands issued through a telnet connection or via simple network management protocol (SNMP) management traffic) so as to add the dedicated client port to the port-based VLAN to which the requested resources are already connected. In an inverted variation of this arrangement, in the VLAN switch can be reconfigured so as to add all pertinent resources to the client&apos;s VLAN. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In another example, one or more routing devices can be modified to enable routing between the client VLAN and the target resource(s). This can be accomplished, for instance, by creating static routing table entries that allow relevant protocols to route between the client VLAN and the various network addresses and protocol ports associated with the service provider resources. In yet a further example, where the static routing entries described above are permanently configured and service provider firewall devices are used, access control lists (ACLs) in the firewall configuration can be modified to provide access. In a last example, instead of having a permanently established client port, an equivalent connection can be dynamically created. This dynamic connection could either be a virtual private network (VPN) tunnel, an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) virtual circuit, or some future technology for rapidly establishing a private connection. As will be appreciated by persons having ordinary skill in the art, myriad existing and yet to be created connectivity methods may apply. Although several methods are explicitly noted herein, it is to be understood that the actual method used is not important. More important, however, is that, irrespective of the connectivity method used, manipulation of the GUI is the same for the administrator, thereby simplifying the administrator&apos;s task and reducing the likelihood of mistakes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Returning to decision element <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, it can then be determined if other selections are to be made by the administrator, e.g., to provide access to another client. If so, flow returns to block <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> and connectivity is provided in similar manner to that described above. If not, flow is terminated. Once connectivity has been provided, the administrator can be notified as to this fact with the GUI, and the client can use the resource <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> for the allotted amount of time. Once this time expires, withdrawal of connectivity can be automatic (i.e., connectivity is set to expire) or can be obtained by reversing the steps through which connectivity was provided. From the perspective of the administrator, this withdrawal of connectivity can be accomplished, for instance, by dragging resources away from the client (VLAN) or through other common methods of GUI manipulation (e.g., selection of an appropriate button, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> While particular embodiments of the invention have been disclosed in detail in the foregoing description and drawings for purposes of example, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that variations and modifications thereof can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims. For instance, although the grant of access to the service provider resources is described as being controlled by a service provider administrator, it is to be appreciated that such control could be given to another operator, such as a client administrator, if desired. In such a situation, however, operation is similar to that described above. </paragraph>
