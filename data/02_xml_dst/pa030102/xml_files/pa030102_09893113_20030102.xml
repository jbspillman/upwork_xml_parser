<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A method of forming openings on a semiconductor wafer comprising an initial step of providing a first film layer over the semiconductor wafer. A first opening in the first film layer is created by transferring an image of the first opening from a photoresist layer into the first film layer using an etching procedure. The first opening includes horizontal and vertical surfaces and has first width and height dimensions. After removing the photoresist layer, a second film layer is deposited over the first film layer and the opening such that the opening has a second width and height dimension which is less than the first width and height dimension. The second film layer is then anisotropically etched from the horizontal surface of the first film layer, and the horizontal surface of the opening such that the opening includes the first height dimension and the second width dimension. The steps of providing the image, creating the first opening, removing the photoresist layer, depositing the second film layer, and anisotropically etching are repeated to provide a second opening in the first film layer. The second opening is adjacent to and a predetermined distance from the first opening, and the first and second openings have different width dimensions. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to manufacturing of integrated circuits and, more particularly, to forming openings on a semiconductor wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In typical integrated circuit silicon wafer manufacturing, creation and integration of circuit patterns and openings or like features includes using a photolithography process or technique. Photolithography techniques are preferably used to form fine resist patterns to define circuits, openings and like features on the silicon wafer. In general, the process includes a light sensitive polymer film for a photoresist being applied to a wafer at a predetermined thickness. Light from a light source passes through a photomask having a predetermined mask (circuit) pattern thereon. The light passing through the photomask forms an aerial image which is projected onto the photoresist on the wafer forming the mask pattern on the photoresist. The photoresists (also known as &ldquo;resists&rdquo;) are exposed to light and subsequently processed by a development process to leave a patterned resist layer on the wafer. The resists are usually positive resists (the areas exposed to the light are removed by the subsequent development process) or negative resists (the areas not exposed to light are removed by the subsequent development process). The patterned resist layer then acts as an in-situ stencil for further processing, which can include Reactive Ion Etch (RIE), Ion Implant (II), Wet Etch (WE), and other processing steps. There are many variations on the technique of printing images in a photoresist film using light projected through a mask. The &ldquo;standard&rdquo; technique would be to print all the images at a given process level at one time through a single mask. After printing the images on the substrate, subsequent etching and/or depositions (or combinations thereof) are done to form the desired structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> More specifically, existing methods or processes start with a silicon (or other kind of) semiconductor substrate or wafer with various films and possibly prior level patterns on it. This substrate can then be spin coated with a layer of photoresist. Sometimes a layer of anti-reflective coating is put onto the substrate before applying the photoresist. The substrate is then processed in some type of light exposure system. The areas of the photoresist where light strikes react with the light. The reaction varies depending on the type of photoresist used, the exposure wavelength used, the subsequent processing conditions, and other variables. The substrate is illuminated using a mask of some sort that intentionally illuminates some areas and intentionally prevents illumination in other areas. The substrate is subsequently processed to remove the photoresist in either the illuminated regions or the unilluminated regions depending on the photoresist type, the temperature and time of baking, and the type of chemical used to dissolve the designated areas of either reacted or unreacted photoresist (the chemical used for this dissolution is commonly known as &ldquo;developer&rdquo;). The remaining photoresist forms an in situ &ldquo;stencil&rdquo; or &ldquo;mask&rdquo; on the substrate. The next step in the process includes processing the substrate to form the desired feature type. In the case where the substrate has a dielectric level, and the desired features are small metal lines or small metal studs, the substrate is typically subjected to a reactive ion etch (RIE) process that would selectively etch the dielectric from areas of the substrate where the photoresist had been removed previously. The remaining photoresist is typically removed by an oxygen plasma strip process. Finally, a blanket metal may be deposited (either by evaporation or plating or some other suitable technique), and then the excess metal is removed by a chemical-mechanical polish operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In the fabrication of integrated circuit devices, high integration is desirable. To achieve this goal the various components in the integrated circuit are made with the smallest possible dimensions. Current semiconductor fabrication technologies available are able to fabricate integrated circuits down to and below 0.13 &mgr;m image size. The photolithography process is instrumental in the fabrication of semiconductors and related semiconductor structures such as, doped areas, and contact openings. In submicron integration, the photolithographic transfer of a pattern from a mask is highly critical. Various methods such as Optical Proximity Correction (OPC), and Phase Shift Masking (PSM), have been proposed to achieve high definition for the pattern transfer from a mask through photolithography onto a photoresist layer. Although existing methods (such as PSM) enhance the pattern definition in fabrication of integrated circuits they are complex and costly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Typical integrated circuit manufacturing processes often involve the creation of openings in various materials by selective etching. For example, openings or trenches can be made in a substrate to provide isolation between individual devices or to provide capacitive charge storage. Other openings, such as vias, or windows, can be made in dielectric layers to facilitate connection between two layers of metallization or between a metallization layer and an active region of a transistor. Commonly, these openings are created by etching a material deposited on a semiconductor wafer to create openings. The openings may be subsequently filled with appropriate materials. For example, a trench may be filled with insulative material to facilitate inter-device isolation. The trench may also be used for capacitive storage, in which case the trench may be lined with one or more layers of insulator films and filled with conductive material. Vias may be subsequently filled with a conductive material, for example a metal providing a conductive link between two layers of metallization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another method uses computer software to compute the dimensions and positional deviations between the resulting patterns on the photoresist layer and the predefined patterns on the mask, and then, uses the data for correction of the size and position of the patterns on the mask. However, a disadvantage of this method is that it requires complex computing to obtain the needed corrections to the mask patterns, and can therefore be difficult or expensive to implement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The manufacturing cost of a given integrated circuit is largely dependent upon the chip area required to implement desired functions. The chip area is defined by the geometries and sizes of the active components such as gate electrodes in metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) and diffused regions such as source and drain regions and bipolar emitters and base regions. These geometries and sizes are often dependent upon the current photolithographic equipment and materials available in the industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Conventional technology used in forming contacts and vias has been done primarily through improvements in photolithography capability. The dependency on the photolithography to achieve adequate projections of images or patterns onto the wafer surface is limited by the photolithography equipments&apos; capability, especially as feature sizes continue to decrease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In fabricating an integrated circuit, apertures, windows or vias are often formed in a layer of insulator material in order to provide a contact to a second layer to electrically connect the second layer to a third layer that is on an opposite side of the insulator layer. The functional area on a semiconductor device is valuable, and the dimensions of these apertures are often made as small as fabrication limitations allow. Therefore, it is necessary to precisely control the diameter of any aperture that is formed in a layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Current methods of photolithography in computer microchip miniaturization produce chips containing in the hundreds of thousands or more transistors. Fabrication of these features is dependent on the resolution or the optical system&apos;s ability to distinguish closely spaced objects. The resolution of the system is an important limitation in achieving minimum device sizes required. In establishing the horizontal dimensions of the various devices and circuits, a pattern must be created which meets design requirements and be correctly aligned to the circuit pattern on the surface of the wafer. As line widths shrink smaller in submicron photolithography, the process of printing lines and contact holes in photoresist becomes increasingly more difficult. Some improvements in photolithography capability have enabled reduction in size of contacts, vias, metal lines and other features. The dependency on photolithography to achieve adequate projection of images of patterns onto the wafer surfaces is limited by the photolithography equipment&apos;s capability, especially as feature sizes continue to decrease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A conventional technique for forming an aperture through an insulator layer to provide access to a lower level conductive layer is to apply or spin a photoresist to the insulator layer and to pattern the photoresist using a photolithographic mask to expose regions of the insulator layer. Plasma etching or reactive ion etching then removes material from the insulator layer, forming apertures at the exposed regions. After removal of the photoresist, a conductive material is deposited within the apertures to electrically connect with the lower level conductive layer. Various factors limit the minimum horizontal dimension of an aperture formed in this manner. For example, aperture size is limited by the resolution of the lithography. In addition to problems involving the size of the aperture, there can be problems with misalignment to the lower conductive layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A typical prior art method of forming a conductive pattern may include forming a first insulating film over a semiconductor substrate, then forming a contact hole by selectively etching a portion of the first insulating film, and successively etching a recess portion of the semiconductor substrate corresponding to the contact hole. A second insulating film is then formed over the entire surface of the first insulating film including the inner surface of the contact hole, and then etching the second insulating film using an anisotropic etching process so that the bottom surface of the recess is exposed and a side wall coating remains in the contact hole. The side wall coating is formed of the second insulating film, extends below the lower surface of the first insulating film and into the recess portion of the substrate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Current lithography equipment cannot print images in photoresist below a certain dimension. Normal processing would require that some sort of pattern transfer technique (such as reactive ion etching) would be used to transfer an image into a dielectric material. This etched image in the dielectric would them be filled with a conducting material (such as a metal or appropriately doped polysilicon). The lower limit on the size of these etched images is limited by multiple factors including, the imaging capability of the lithography equipment being used, the performance of the photoresist (or other photo imaged) material, and the pattern transfer equipment/process capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A shortcoming in existing methods is that the density and lower size limit of the images that can be printed are restricted. Using existing methods, the image size that can be printed through a mask has a lower limit typically given by the formula </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Resolution&equals;(<highlight><italic>k</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>*wavelength)/(<highlight><italic>NA</italic></highlight>) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Where &ldquo;wavelength&rdquo; is the wavelength of the exposing light, &ldquo;NA&rdquo; is the effective numerical aperture of the exposure lens being used, and k<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a constant that depends on the type of mask, the photoresist properties, and other physical parameters. NA has an upper limit value of 1 (it is the sine of an angle). For a given wavelength, it is generally accepted that the physical lower limit on k<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for conventional optical transmission lenses is approximately 0.25. In practice, however, a k<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> value of 0.25 is difficult to achieve and k<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> values of 0.5 to 0.8 are typical for industry manufacturing processes. The density of the images that can be achieved are directly related to the resolution. If the minimum image that can be resolved is given as &ldquo;Q&rdquo;, and the minimum space between images of size &ldquo;Q&rdquo; that can be achieved is &ldquo;R&rdquo;, then it follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The maximum density of images would be given as 1/((Q&plus;R)*(Q&plus;R)). There would be one image of dimensions Q by Q in an area (Q&plus;R)*(Q&plus;R). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Bearing in mind the problems and deficiencies of the prior art, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for achieving device sizes below the current photolithography capability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for increasing circuit component density on a wafer in an integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a method for simultaneously achieving device size below the current photolithography capability and increase component density on a wafer on a integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A further object of the invention is to provide an efficient and effective method for increasing circuit component density on a wafer in an integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Still other objects and advantages of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part be apparent from the specification. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(s) </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> In describing the preferred embodiment of the present invention, reference will be made herein to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of the drawings in which like numerals refer to like features of the invention. Features of the invention are not necessarily shown to scale in the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes combining a technique for reducing the achieved image size (&ldquo;Q&rdquo;), with a technique for reducing the minimum space achievable between two images of minimum resolution size (&ldquo;R&rdquo;), to increase the maximum achievable image density. The advantage of this invention includes a higher density final image. The number of circuits that a semiconductor manufacturer can put on a microchip and the speed of those circuits is often a direct function of the maximum image density for a given process. Thus, increased image density can result in an increased number of circuits in the same area, thereby increasing the achievable speed of the chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> If &ldquo;Qi&rdquo; is the minimum image size achievable in this invention and &ldquo;Ri&rdquo; is the minimum space achievable between adjacent images of size &ldquo;Qi&rdquo;, then the maximum density of images could be given as 1/((Qi&plus;Ri)*(Qi&plus;Ri)). For example, where Q&equals;1 and R&equals;1, and the invention allows a normalized &ldquo;Qi&rdquo; of 0.7 and a normalized &ldquo;Ri&rdquo; of 0.7, then the final achievable image density comparison would be: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Starting maximum density 1/((1&plus;1)*(1&plus;1))&equals;0.25 </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Invention maximum density 1/((0.7&plus;0.7)*(0.7&plus;0.7))&equals;0.51 (rounded to the hundredths decimal place) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, a technique is described to &ldquo;shrink&rdquo; the minimum dimension that the conductive material can be fabricated to by using a post-etch deposition and subsequent anisotropic etch of a dielectric material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> known and existing technique is shown in a process flow <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrating a method for manufacturing vias on a semiconductor wafer used in integrated circuit manufacture. The process <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a first step <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> showing a dielectric film material layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> positioned between a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a substrate or semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. An opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is present in a mask <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to expose a specified area of the photoresist film layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The photoresist film layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is exposed using typical photolithographic techniques to produce an image having a feature in the photoresist film layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In the next step <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the exposed feature is developed to produce a trench <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> in the photoresist film layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In the following step <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, the dielectric film layer corresponding with the trench <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is treated using reactive ion etching to produce a via <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in the dielectric film layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a width &ldquo;W&rdquo;, and the remaining photoresist film <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is stripped away. The resulting dielectric film via width is W<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>which corresponds to the resist image width W by the etch bias e, and represented by the equation: W<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&equals;W&plus;e. Next, in step <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, a conductive film <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is put over the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> including the via <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. The final step <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> includes removing the excess conductive material <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, leaving the via <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> with a layer of conductive film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a known process <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, similar to the process shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, however, the process of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> results in multiple feature images including vias <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The first step <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> includes a dielectric film layer between a photoresist film layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a substrate or semiconductor wafer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Further, the first step <highlight><bold>81</bold></highlight> includes providing a mask <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> having openings <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to expose the photoresist film layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> beneath it. The photoresist film layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is exposed using typical photolithographic techniques. In the next step <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, the exposed photoresist film is removed to provide two trenches <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the photoresist layer. The trenches <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> have width &ldquo;W&rdquo; and a first space portion <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of photoresist <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> between the trenches having a width &ldquo;S&rdquo;. The minimum value of S is limited by diffraction effects of the exposure light being used and the mechanical stability of the photoresist of width S. The next step <highlight><bold>83</bold></highlight> includes using reactive ion etching to provide vias <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in the dielectric film layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and stripping away the remaining photoresist. The vias <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> have a width &ldquo;W<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&rdquo;, and a second space portion <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of dielectric film material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> between the vias <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has a width S<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>. The width of the etched images W<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and the space portion between then S<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>are related to the width of the developed resist images W and the space portion between them S by the etch bias &ldquo;e&rdquo; represented by: W<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&equals;W&plus;e and S<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&equals;S&minus;e. In the next step <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> a blanket deposition of a conductive film is placed over the dielectric film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> which covers and fills the vias <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The final step <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> is to remove the excess conductive material <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> from the dielectric and leave the vias <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> with a layer of conductive material <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> known process <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is illustrated having a first step <highlight><bold>151</bold></highlight> providing a mask <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> having an opening <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> for exposing the photoresist film layer <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with image features. As in the previous embodiments shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the image features includes a via to be developed in the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The photoresist film <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is first exposed to create an image <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and then exposed a second time to create another of the same image <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, as shown in the next step <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, using typical photolithographic techniques. In the next step <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>, the images are developed and the exposed regions of the photoresist are removed to form the vias <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having a width &ldquo;W&rdquo;. The vias define a space portion of photoresist material between them having a width of S<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The minimum size of S<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>depends on factors which include the mechanical integrity of a resist space portion of dimensions S<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>during the development process. The next step <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, includes using reactive ion etching of the dielectric layer to produce vias <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and a space portion between the vias <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> having a width S<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>. The via widths W<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and the space portion width S<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>are related to the developed resist image widths W and the developed resist image space portion S<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>by the etch bias e, represented by: W<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&equals;W&plus;e and S<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>&equals;S<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&minus;e. In the next step <highlight><bold>155</bold></highlight> a blanket deposition of conductive material is deposited over the dielectric film including the vias <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In the final step <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, the conductive material <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> is removed from the dielectric layer leaving the vias <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> with a layer of conductive material <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The size of the final image is the same as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, however, the spacing S<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>between the images has decreased from S<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, to S<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, thereby increasing the overall image density. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> known process <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is illustrated showing sidewall deposition. In the first step <highlight><bold>251</bold></highlight>, an image is created on photoresist film <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> using a mask <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> to produce multiple images with one exposure using typical photolithographic techniques, as in the embodiments shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The next step <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>, shows vias <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> formed in the photoresist film layer <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> after exposure, having a width W, and a space portion between the vias <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> of S. The minimum value of S is limited by diffraction of the exposure light being used and the mechanical stability of the photoresist of width S. In the next step <highlight><bold>253</bold></highlight>, reactive ion etching is used followed by stripping of the remaining photoresist material <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> resulting in vias <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> in the dielectric material <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. The vias <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> in the dielectric material have a width W<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>, and the dielectric space <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> between the vias <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> has a width S<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The next step <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> includes providing a blanket deposition of dielectric film having a thickness &ldquo;d&rdquo; over the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and in the vias <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight>. The vias thus have their width reduced by twice the thickness d of the dielectric film, and define a portion of dielectric between them <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> having a width of S<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>. The portion <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> is created by the first dielectric film layer <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and the added dielectric film having thickness d. In the next step <highlight><bold>255</bold></highlight>, an anisotropic reactive ion etch of the dielectric layer is completed leaving the vias <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> having a width of W<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The final dimension of the width W<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is represented by: W<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;W<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&minus;2.0*d&equals;(W&plus;e)&minus;2.0*d; and S<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>&equals;S<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&plus;2.0*d&equals;(S&minus;e)&plus;2.0*d. The final steps <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>267</bold></highlight>, includes adding a layer of conductive material over the dielectric and removing the excess, leaving the vias <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> with a layer of conductive material <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A, a process <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is shown which illustrates an embodiment of the present invention which includes a multiple exposure, and a sidewall deposition after the images are etched into the dielectric material. A first step <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> includes a mask having an opening <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> allowing the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> below to be exposed. A dielectric film layer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> is positioned between a semiconductor substrate or wafer <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and a photoresist film layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. A layer of antireflective coating (not shown) may be applied to the top surface of the substrate before depositing a photoresist layer. In the embodiment depicted in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A, the next step <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> shows the image developed on the photoresist and the exposed region being removed providing a via <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> having a width W in the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The next step <highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight> includes using reactive ion etching to transfer the image into the dielectric film layer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> to provide a via <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>. The remaining photoresist is stripped off the dielectric film layer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. The width of the via <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> is W<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>and is represented by the equation: W<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&equals;W&plus;e. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The next step <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>, includes depositing a second layer of photoresist <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> over the dielectric film <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and the via <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> using the mask <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> and photolithographic technique of step <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight>. The next step <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>, includes developing the exposed photoresist to create a via <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> in the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. The via <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight> is positioned adjacent to the first via <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> defining a space portion <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> having a width S<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>between the first vias <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> and the second via <highlight><bold>313</bold></highlight>. The space portion S<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>can be made significantly smaller than the space portion S<highlight><superscript>3 </superscript></highlight>shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> (step <highlight><bold>153</bold></highlight>), because S<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>is not limited by the mechanical integrity of a small resist island during the development process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> In the next step <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>, the photoresist image is transferred to the dielectric film <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> using reactive ion etching to transfer the via <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> into the dielectric film layer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and the photoresist is subsequently stripped. The space portion S<highlight><superscript>6 </superscript></highlight>between the first via <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, and the via <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> from the second exposure is related to the space portion S<highlight><superscript>5 </superscript></highlight>in the previous step <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight> by the equation: S<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>&equals;S<highlight><superscript>5</superscript></highlight>&minus;0.5&plus;e. The next step <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> includes providing a blanket deposition of a thin dielectric layer of thickness d over the dielectric film layer <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and the vias <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. The following step <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>, includes using an anisotropic reactive ion etch of the dielectric film to remove the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> from the bottom <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> of the vias <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. The remaining thickness of the dielectric on the sidewalls of the vias <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> has a thickness d<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>. The final via width is W<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and the final width of the space portion <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> between the vias <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is S<highlight><superscript>7 </superscript></highlight>which relates to the width of space portion <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> of step <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight> by the equation: W<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;W<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&minus;2.0*d<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&equals;(W&plus;e)&minus;2.0*d<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>; and S<highlight><superscript>7</superscript></highlight>&equals;S<highlight><superscript>6</superscript></highlight>&plus;2.0*d<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&equals;(S<highlight><superscript>5</superscript></highlight>&minus;0.5 *e)&plus;2.0*d<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>. The final two steps <highlight><bold>359</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> include providing a conductive film deposition over the dielectric layer and in the vias <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. The conductive film is etched off of the dielectric layer leaving the vias <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> with a layer of conductive material <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. The final via width W<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is smaller than the final image width W<highlight><superscript>1 </superscript></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> because the method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A, uses the steps to provide a sidewall (steps <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>358</bold></highlight>), in conjunction with the steps providing multiple exposures (steps <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight>) and sequential photoresist film layers <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. Thus, the final spacing portion <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> having a width S<highlight><superscript>7</superscript></highlight>, is smaller than in the previous embodiments because it is not limited by the mechanical integrity of a small photoresist space portion or proximity to a neighboring printed image. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Specifically, referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the minimum value of S<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>might be limited to approximately 0.67*W. For example, for 248 nm exposures in 0.45 micron thick photoresist, a value of W might be 0.150 microns, and minimum values of S would be &tilde;0.100 microns. Also, typical values of &ldquo;e&rdquo; are often small enough to be ignored and can be considered identical to zero for estimation purposes.

<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A, a process <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is illustrated which depicts another embodiment of the present invention. The process <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes two exposures each followed by an etching and deposition. The process <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> initially provides a dielectric layer <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> positioned between a semiconductor substrate or wafer <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> and a photoresist layer <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>. The first three steps <highlight><bold>451</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>453</bold></highlight>, are the same as the steps in the previous embodiment <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, steps <highlight><bold>351</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>353</bold></highlight>, which result in a via <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> in the dielectric film layer <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> having a width W<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>. The next step <highlight><bold>454</bold></highlight>, includes depositing a dielectric film <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> having a thickness d over the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and over the via <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>. In the next step <highlight><bold>455</bold></highlight>, an anisotropic reactive image etch is used to remove the dielectric film <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> from over the dielectric layer <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and from the bottom <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> of the via <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. The remaining sidewalls <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> in the via <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> has a thickness d<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>. In the sequential steps <highlight><bold>456</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>, a second exposure pass is made creating a second via <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> in the dielectric film layer <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> adjacent to the first via <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>. The second via <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> is more closely positioned to the first via <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> than when creating the vias by a single exposure pass. Referring to step <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>, the first via&apos;s <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight> width is W<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, and is separated from the second via <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> by a space portion <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> having a width S<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>. After the reactive ion etching of the dielectric film and the removal of the remaining photoresist, of step <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>, the space portion <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> with width S<highlight><superscript>10 </superscript></highlight>can be represented by the equation: W<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&equals;W&plus;e and S<highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>&equals;S<highlight><superscript>9</superscript></highlight>&minus;0.5*e, where e is the etch bias of transferring the image of width W into the dielectric layer with resultant width W<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>. In the next step <highlight><bold>459</bold></highlight>, a second dielectric film is deposited over the dielectric film layer <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight> and in the vias <highlight><bold>415</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> of step <highlight><bold>458</bold></highlight>. In the next step <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>, the first via <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> now has a first sidewall layer of dielectric film <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight> and a second sidewall layer of dielectric film <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, while the second via <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight> has only the second layer of dielectric film <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. Next, another reactive ion etch is completed of the dielectric film <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> from over the dielectric film layer <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, and the bottom of both vias <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight> which have widths W<highlight><superscript>4 </superscript></highlight>and W<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, respectively, and the space portion <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> between the two vias <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> has a width S<highlight><superscript>11</superscript></highlight>. The final dimensions of the vias, the first via <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> having width W<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>, and the second via <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> having width W<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>, and the space portion <highlight><bold>434</bold></highlight> having width S<highlight><superscript>11 </superscript></highlight>can be represented by the equations: W<highlight><superscript>4</superscript></highlight>&equals;W<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&minus;2.0*d<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&equals;W<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&minus;4.0*d<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&equals;(W&plus;e)&minus;4.0*d<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>; W<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&equals;W<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&minus;2.0*d<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&equals;(W&plus;e)&minus;2.0*d<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>; and S<highlight><superscript>11&equals;S</superscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>10</superscript></highlight>&plus;2.0*d<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>&equals;(S<highlight><superscript>9</superscript></highlight>&minus;0.5*e)&plus;2.0*d<highlight><superscript>1</superscript></highlight>.
