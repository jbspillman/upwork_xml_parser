<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to color picture tubes having tension masks, and particularly to a tube having means for connecting a tension mask, that is made of a material having a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion material, to a support frame, that has a significantly higher coefficient of thermal expansion. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A color picture tube includes an electron gun for generating and directing three electron beams to the screen of the tube. The screen is located on the inner surface of a faceplate of the tube and is made up of an array of elements of three different color-emitting phosphors. A color selection electrode, which may be either a shadow mask or a focus mask, is interposed between the gun and the screen to permit each electron beam to strike only the phosphor elements associated with that beam. A shadow mask is a thin sheet of metal, such as steel, that is usually contoured to somewhat parallel the inner surface of the tube faceplate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One type of color picture tube has a tension mask mounted within a faceplate panel thereof. In order to maintain the tension on the mask, the mask must be attached to a relatively massive support frame. Although such tubes have found wide consumer acceptance, there is still a need for further improvement, to reduce the weight and cost of the mask-frame assemblies in such tubes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It has been suggested that a lighter frame could be used in a tension mask tube if the required tension on a mask is reduced. One way to reduce the required mask tension is to make the mask from a material having a low coefficient of thermal expansion. However, a mask from such material requires a support frame of a material having a similar coefficient of thermal expansion, to prevent any mismatch of expansions during thermal processing that is required for tube manufacturing, and during tube operation. Because the metal materials that have low coefficients of thermal expansion are relatively expensive, it is costly to make both the mask and frame out of identical or similar low expansion materials. Therefore, it is desirable to use the combination of a low expansion tension mask with a higher expansion support frame, and to provide a solution to the problem that exists when there is a substantial mismatch in coefficients of thermal expansion between a tension mask and its support frame. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an improvement in a color picture tube having a tensioned mask supported by a support frame mounted within the tube. The mask has a significantly lower coefficient of thermal expansion than the frame. Intermediate members are located between the mask and the frame. The intermediate members are of a material having a coefficient of thermal expansion similar to that of the mask. The frame has elongated tabs extending therefrom. Each of the tabs is attached at one end thereof to the remaining portion of the frame. The distal ends of at least some of the tabs are welded to the intermediate members.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a color picture tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a glass envelope <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> comprising a rectangular faceplate panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a tubular neck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> connected by a funnel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The funnel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> has an internal conductive coating (not shown) that extends from an anode button <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> toward the panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and to the neck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The panel <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises a substantially cylindrical or flat viewing faceplate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a peripheral flange or sidewall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which is sealed to the funnel <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by a glass frit <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. A three-color phosphor screen <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is carried by the inner surface of the faceplate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The screen <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a line screen with the phosphor lines arranged in triads, each triad including a phosphor line of each of the three colors. A color selection tension mask <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is removably mounted in predetermined spaced relation to the screen <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. An electron gun <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, shown schematically by dashed lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, is centrally mounted within the neck <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to generate and direct three inline electron beams, a center beam and two side or outer beams, along convergent paths through the mask <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to the screen <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The tube <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is designed to be used with an external magnetic deflection yoke, such as the yoke <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> shown in the neighborhood of the funnel-to-neck junction. When activated, the yoke <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> subjects the three beams to magnetic fields which cause the beams to scan horizontally and vertically in a rectangular raster over the screen <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The tension mask <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is attached to a peripheral frame <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that includes two long sides <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and two short sides <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The two long sides <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the frame parallel a central major axis, X, of the tube; and the two short sides <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> parallel a central minor axis, Y, of the tube. The tension mask <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> includes an apertured portion that contains a plurality of metal strips having a multiplicity of elongated slits therebetween that parallel the minor axis of the mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Details of the frame <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The long sides of the frame <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> have an L-shaped cross-section formed by two flanges <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. One flange <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is in the X-Y plane, perpendicular to the central longitudinal Z axis of the tube. The second flange <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in the X-Z plane, extending perpendicularly to the Y axis. The short sides <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> also have an L-shaped cross-section, but could be shaped in other cross-sections, such as square, rectangular or even solid. The second flange <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of slits <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> therein that extend from near the proximal end connection with the first flange <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the distal edge of the second flange. The slits <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> define a series of tabs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in the frame <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, each of the tabs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is welded near its distal end to an intermediate member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, the intermediate members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> need not be attached to all of the tabs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Each intermediate member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> extends the length of a long side, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, and overlaps the second flange <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> that includes the tabs <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The mask <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is attached between the distal edges of two parallel intermediate members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, that are attached to the two long sides <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the frame <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The intermediate members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are of a material that has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, similar to that of the mask <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Therefore, expansion mismatch between the mask and the frame, caused by changes in temperature, does not occur and mask wrinkling during tube manufacturing and mask/frame warping during tube operation do not occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the L-shaped frame is made from 4130 steel, and the intermediate members and mask are made of low expansion materials, such as Invar. The L-shaped frame is 1.27 mm (0.050&Prime;) thick, and the intermediate members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are 3.05 mm (0.120&Prime;) thick. In general, thicknesses of the component parts of the complete frame assembly are determined by considering mask thickness, the flexibility of the total mask-frame assembly and the desired warp misregistration limits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Further embodiments are shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 9</cross-reference>. Each of the embodiments utilizes two intermediate members, that are either the same or similar to the members <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> used in the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The frame <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is similar to the frame <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, except that along each long side <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>&prime; an angled portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> extends between two flanges <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; to form a triangularly shaped cross-section. The angled portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of slits <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> that are aligned with slits <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>&prime; in the second flange <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; An intermediate member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>&prime; is located between the flange <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>&prime; and the angled portion <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The formation of a triangular cross-section provides for a rigid frame, even with thinner material than that required for the frame <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a frame <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> that includes slits <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> having varied spacings to form narrower and wider sections, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, respectively, in a second flange <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The narrower sections <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are the tabs to which the intermediate member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is attached. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> show the end tab of the frame <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in an unheated condition and in a heated condition, respectively. When the frame is heated, it expands more than does the intermediate member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Compensation for this expansion differential, to maintain the position of the intermediate member <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, is provided by the flexure of the tab. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> show two additional frames <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, respectively. Each of these frames has tabs that are enclosed within unopen cutouts in a flange of the frame. In the frame <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> plurality of tabs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> extend down from the distal edge of a flange <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, and are attached by welding to an intermediate member <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. In the frame <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> plurality of tabs <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> extend upward toward the distal edge of a flange <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, and are attached by welding to an intermediate member <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
