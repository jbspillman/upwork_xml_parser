<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A fluid delivery system is provided for delivering a fluid to a polishing surface of a chemical mechanical polishing tool. The system includes a platen, manifold and slurry delivery conduit. The platen has a plurality of conduits for allowing a fluid to pass to the polishing surface. The manifold, through the use of a plurality of channels, controls the fluid distribution to the conduits in the platen. The channel cross-sectional area at substantially every point is greater than, preferably 1.5 to 2 times, the combined cross-sectional area of all the conduits being serviced by the channel. This results in the conduits being the most restrictive feature and a uniform pressure within the manifold.

<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to polishing a surface of a workpiece. More particularly, the invention relates to improved methods and apparatus for distributing fluids, for example slurry, to the surface of a polishing pad during chemical mechanical polishing. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Chemical mechanical polishing or planarizing a surface of an object may be desirable for several reasons. For example, chemical mechanical polishing is often used in the formation of microelectronic devices to provide a substantially smooth, planar surface suitable for subsequent fabrication processes such as photoresist coating and pattern definition. Chemical mechanical polishing may also be used to form microelectronic features. For example, a conductive feature such as a metal line or a conductive plug may be formed on a surface of a wafer by forming trenches and vias on the wafer surface, depositing conductive material over the wafer surface and into the trenches and vias, and removing the conductive material on the surface of the wafer using chemical mechanical polishing, leaving the vias and trenches filled with the conductive material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A typical chemical mechanical polishing apparatus suitable for planarizing the semiconductor surface generally includes a wafer carrier configured to support, guide, and apply pressure to a wafer during the polishing process; a polishing compound such as a slurry containing abrasive particles and chemicals to assist removal of material from the surface of the wafer; and a polishing surface such as a polishing pad. In addition, the polishing apparatus may include an integrated wafer cleaning system and/or an automated load and unload station to facilitate automatic processing of the wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A wafer surface is generally polished by moving the surface of the wafer to be polished relative to the polishing surface in the presence of the polishing compound. In particular, the wafer is placed in the carrier such that the surface to be polished is placed in contact with the polishing surface and the polishing surface and the wafer are moved relative to each other while slurry is supplied to the polishing surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The distribution of slurry over the polishing surface has been shown to be a critical factor in the chemical mechanical polishing process. The material removal rate across the surface of the wafer is generally related to the amount of slurry received by the polishing surface. Areas on the polishing surface having additional slurry will typically polish the wafer faster than areas on the polishing surface having less slurry. While the material removal rate may be fine tuned by intentionally adjusting the slurry distribution across the polishing surface, it is desirable to have a substantially uniform slurry distribution across the polishing surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One approach to distributing slurry across a polishing surface involves depositing the slurry from above in the middle of the polishing surface. Polishing surfaces typically move, for example, in a rotational, orbital or linear motion. The motion, in addition to removing material from the front surface of the wafer, helps to distribute the slurry across the polishing surface. However, this approach leads to a concentration of slurry in the middle of the polishing surface with the concentration of slurry declining in relation to its distance from the middle of the polishing surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Another approach to distributing slurry across a polishing surface involves pumping slurry from a cavity below the polishing surface through apertures in a platen and polishing surface to the polishing surface. However, the motions previously mentioned cause the slurry to concentrate along the periphery of the cavity and therefore, when forced to the polishing surface, the slurry is concentrated along the periphery of the polishing surface. As a partial correction for this problem, a cut o-ring has been spirally inserted into the cavity to reduce the concentration of slurry at the periphery of the polishing pad. However, the optimum shape of the cut spiral o-ring is difficult to determine and the optimum shape changes with different slurry delivery rates, speed of motions and types of slurry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another problem with using the cavity to distribute the slurry is the time it takes to change from a first slurry reaching the surface of the polishing pad to a second slurry reaching the surface of the polishing pad. Applicant has noticed the delay is caused by the cavity having a volume filled with the first slurry that must be completely replaced by the second slurry. The Applicant has also noticed the problem is compounded by parts of the cavity having no real flow direction resulting in a turbulent fluid motion. The turbulent fluid motion results in a mixing of the slurry and an additional time period when both slurries are delivered to the polishing surface further lengthening the time for a complete slurry change over. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> What is needed is a method and apparatus for uniformly delivering a fluid to a polishing surface without being unduly affected by slurry delivery rates, speed of motions or types of slurry. The method and apparatus preferably allow a change in slurry to be quickly accomplished. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides improved methods and apparatus for chemical mechanical polishing of a surface of a workpiece that overcome many of the shortcomings of the prior art. While the ways in which the present invention addresses the drawbacks of the now-known techniques for chemical mechanical polishing will be described in greater detail hereinbelow, in general, in accordance with various aspects of the present invention, the invention provides an improved method and apparatus for controlling the distribution of a fluid across a polishing surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The invention is a fluid delivery system for delivering a fluid to a polishing surface for a chemical mechanical polishing tool. The invention includes a platen, manifold and slurry delivery conduit. The platen supports the polishing surface and has a plurality of conduits for allowing a fluid to pass through the conduits in the platen and, preferably, through corresponding conduits in the polishing surface. This allows the fluid to reach the working area of the polishing surface. The platen may comprise several layers for performing additional functions not directly related to fluid distribution to the polishing surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The manifold controls the fluid distribution to the conduits to allow the fluid to pass through the platen and polishing pad. The manifold uses a plurality of channels in controlling the fluid distribution to the conduits of the platen. The channels may be formed in the manifold in a variety of ways, including, for example, by removing material from a monolithic manifold by machining or etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the invention, the volume of all the channels is less than a third of the volume of the whole manifold. Reducing the volume of the channels reduces the time for a fluid change over. In another embodiment of the invention the channel cross-sectional area at substantially every point in the channels is greater than, preferably between by 1.5 and 2 times, the combined cross-sectional area of all the conduits being serviced by the channel. This causes the conduits in the platen to be the most restrictive feature in the fluid flow path resulting in a uniform backpressure in the manifold and therefore resulting in a uniform velocity of fluid flow. The cross-section of the channels may be incrementally changed or smoothly tapered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The slurry delivery conduit communicates fluid from a fluid source to the channels in the manifold. The slurry delivery conduit is preferably in fluid communication with a central area of the manifold that feeds the plurality of channels. The slurry delivery conduit may be in fluid communication with a plurality of fluid sources so that a plurality of different fluids, preferably one at a time, may be communicated to the channels in the manifold as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In operation, a fluid may be distributed across a polishing surface by pumping a fluid from a fluid source to a central area connected to a plurality of channels in a manifold. The fluid is communicated through the plurality of channels in the manifold to a plurality of conduits in a platen. Incrementally changing or tapering the channels as previously described results in a substantially uniform velocity of the fluid throughout the channels. The fluid travels through the conduits in the platen and through the polishing surface, preferably through corresponding conduits in the polishing surface, to reach a working area of the polishing surface.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The following description is of exemplary embodiments only and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability or configuration of the invention in any way. Rather, the following description provides a convenient illustration for implementing exemplary embodiments of the invention. Various changes to the described embodiments may be made in the function and arrangement of the elements described without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a top cut-way view of a polishing apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, suitable for removing material from a surface of a workpiece, in accordance with the present invention. Apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a multi-platen polishing system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a clean system <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and a wafer load and unload station <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In addition, apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a cover (not illustrated) that surrounds apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to isolate apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from the surrounding environment. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention machine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is a Momentum machine available from SpeedFam-IPEC Corporation of Chandler, Ariz. However, machine <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be any machine capable of removing material from a workpiece surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention may be used to remove material from a surface of a variety of workpieces such as magnetic discs, optical discs, and the like, the invention is conveniently described below in connection with removing material from a surface of a wafer. In the context of the present invention, the term &ldquo;wafer&rdquo; shall mean semiconductor substrates, which may include layers of insulating, semiconducting, and conducting layers or features formed thereon, used to manufacture microelectronic devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Exemplary polishing system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> includes four polishing stations <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, which each operate independently; a buff station <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>; a transition stage <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>; a robot <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>; and optionally, a metrology station <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Polishing stations <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be configured as desired to perform specific functions; however, in accordance with the present invention, at least one of stations <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> includes an orbital polish station as described herein.

The configuration of conditioners <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> generally depends on the type of polishing surface to be conditioned. For example, when the polishing surface comprises a polyurethane polishing pad, conditioners <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> suitably include a rigid substrate coated with diamond material. Various other surface conditioners may also be used in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Clean system <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is generally configured to remove debris such as slurry residue and material removed from the wafer surface during polishing. In accordance with the illustrated embodiment, system <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> includes clean stations <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, a spin rinse dryer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, and a robot <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> configured to transport the wafer between clean stations <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and spin rinse dryer <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>. In accordance with one aspect of this embodiment, each clean station <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> includes two concentric circular brushes, which contact the top and bottom surfaces of a wafer during a clean process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary clean station (e.g., station <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>) in greater detail. Clean station <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> includes brushes <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> mounted to brush platens <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>. Station <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> also includes movable rollers&mdash;e.g., capstan rollers <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>&mdash;to keep the wafer in place during the clean process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, during the clean operation, a wafer is placed onto the capstan rollers, and lower clean platen <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and brush <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> rise to contact and apply pressure to a lower surface of the wafer, while upper platen <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and brush <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> lower to contact the upper surface of the wafer The brushes are then caused to rotate about their axes to scour the surfaces of the wafer in the presence of a cleaning fluid such as deionized water and/or a NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>OH solution. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Wafer load and unload station <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is configured to receive dry wafers for processing in cassettes <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. In accordance with the present invention, the wafers are dry when loaded onto station <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and are dry before return to station <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In accordance with an alternate embodiment of the invention, clean system <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may be separate from the polishing apparatus. In this case, load station <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> is configured to receive dry wafers for processing, and the wafers are held in a wet (e.g., deionized water) environment until the wafers are transferred to the clean station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In operation, cassettes <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, including one or more wafers, are loaded onto apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at station <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. A wafer from one of cassettes <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is transported to a stage <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> using a dry robot <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. A wet robot <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> retrieves the wafer at stage <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and transports the wafer to metrology station <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> for film characterization or to stage <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> within polishing system <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. In this context, a &ldquo;wet robot&rdquo; means automation equipment configured to transport wafers that have been exposed to a liquid or that may have liquid remaining on the wafer and a &ldquo;dry robot&rdquo; means automation equipment configured to transport wafers that are substantially dry. Robot <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> picks up the wafer from metrology station <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> or stage <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> and transports the wafer to one of polishing stations <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> for chemical mechanical polishing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> After polishing, the wafer is transferred to buff station <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> to further polish the surface of the wafer. The wafer is then transferred (optionally to metrology station <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and) to stage <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, which keeps the wafers in a wet environment, for pickup by robot <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>. Once the wafer is removed from the polishing surface, conditioners <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> may be employed to condition the polishing surface. Conditioners <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> may also be employed prior to polishing a wafer to prepare the surface for wafer polishing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> After a wafer is placed in stage <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, robot <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> picks up the wafer and transports the wafer to clean system <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>.

Although illustrated with three polishing stations, apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may include any desired number of polishing stations and one or more of such polishing stations may be used to buff a surface of a wafer as described herein. Furthermore, apparatus <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may include an integrated wafer clean and dry system similar to system <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Wafer transfer station <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> is generally configured to stage wafers before or between polishing processes and to load and unload wafers from wafer carriers described below. In addition, station <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> may be configured to perform additional functions such as washing the wafers and/or maintaining the wafers in a wet environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Carousel apparatus <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> includes polishing heads <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, each configured to hold a single wafer. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, three of carriers <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> are configured to retain and urge the wafer against a polishing surface (e.g., a polishing surface associated with one of stations <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>) and one of carriers <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is configured to transfer a wafer between a polishing station and stage <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. Each carrier <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is suitably spaced from post <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, such that each carrier aligns with a polishing station or station <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, each carrier <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> is attached to a rotatable drive mechanism using a gimbal system (not illustrated), which allows carriers <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> to cause a wafer to rotate (e.g., during a polishing process). In addition, the carriers may be attached to a carrier motor assembly that is configured to cause the carriers to translate&mdash;e.g., along tracks <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. In accordance with one aspect of this embodiment, each carrier <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight> rotates and translates independently of the other carriers. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> System <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes polishing stations <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>, a buff station <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, a head loading station <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>, a transfer station <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>, a wet robot <highlight><bold>514</bold></highlight>, a dry robot <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight>, a rotatable index table <highlight><bold>518</bold></highlight>, and a clean station <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> During a polishing process, a wafer is held in place by a carrier <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, illustrate in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. Carrier <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> includes a receiving plate <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>, including one or more apertures <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight>, and a retaining ring <highlight><bold>606</bold></highlight>. Apertures <highlight><bold>604</bold></highlight> are designed to assist retention of a wafer by carrier <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> by, for example, allowing a vacuum pressure to be applied to a back side of the wafer or by creating enough surface tension to retain the wafer. Retaining ring limits the movement of the wafer during the polishing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In operation, dry robot <highlight><bold>516</bold></highlight> unloads a wafer from a cassette <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and places the wafer on transfer station <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a polishing apparatus <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> suitable for polishing a surface of a wafer in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention. Apparatus <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> includes a lower polish module <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>, including a platen <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> and a polishing surface <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> and an upper polish module <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, including a body <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and a retaining ring <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>, which retains the wafer during polishing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Upper polish module or carrier <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> is generally configured to receive a wafer for polishing and urge the wafer against the polishing surface during a polishing process. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, carrier <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> is configured to receive a wafer, apply a vacuum force (e.g., about 55 to about 70 cm Hg at sea level) to the backside of wafer <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> to retain the wafer, move in the direction of the polishing surface to place the wafer in contact with polishing surface <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>, release the vacuum, and apply a force (e.g., about 0 to about 8 psi.) in the direction of the polishing surface. In addition, carrier <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> is configured to cause the wafer to move. For example, carrier <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> may be configured to cause the wafer to move in a rotational, orbital, or translational direction. In accordance with one aspect of this embodiment, carrier <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> is configured to rotate at about 2 rpm to about 20 rpm about an axis <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Carrier <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> also includes a resilient film <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> interposed between a wafer <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> and body <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> to provide a cushion for wafer <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> during a polishing process. Carrier <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight> may also include an air bladder <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight> configured to provide a desired, controllable pressure to a backside of the wafer during a polishing process. In this case, the bladder may be divided into plenums or zones such that various amounts of pressure may be independently applied to each zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Lower polishing module <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is generally configured to cause the polishing surface to move. By way of example, lower module <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> may be configured to cause the polishing surface to rotate, translate, orbit, or any combination thereof. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, lower module <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is configured such that platen <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> orbits with a radius of about 0.25 to about 1 inch, about an axis <highlight><bold>722</bold></highlight> at about 30 to about 340 orbits per minute, while simultaneously causing the platen <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight> to dither or partially rotate. In this case, material is removed primarily from the orbital motion of module <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>. Causing the polishing surface to move in an orbital direction is advantageous because it allows a relatively constant speed between the wafer surface and the polishing surface to be maintained during a polishing process. Thus, material removal rates are relatively constant across the wafer surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Polishing apparatus including orbiting lower modules <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> are additionally advantageous because they require relatively little space compared to rotational polishing modules described below. In particular, because a relatively constant velocity between the wafer surface and the polishing surface can be maintained across the wafer surface by moving the polishing surface in an orbital motion, the polishing surface can be about the same size as the surface to be polished. For example, a diameter of the polishing surface may be about 0.5 inches greater than the diameter of the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates a portion of a lower polishing module <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>, including a platen <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and a polishing surface <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>, suitable for use with polishing apparatus <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. Platen <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and polishing surface <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> include conduits <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> formed therein to allow polishing fluid such as slurry to flow through platen <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and surface <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> toward a surface of the wafer during the polishing process. Flowing slurry toward the surface of the wafer during the polishing process is advantageous because the slurry acts as a lubricant and thus reduces friction between the wafer surface and polishing surface <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. In addition, providing slurry through the platen <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and toward the wafer facilitates uniform distribution of the slurry across the surface of the wafer, which in turn facilitates uniform material removal from the wafer surface. The slurry flow rates may be selected for a particular application; however, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the slurry flow rates are less than about 200 ml/minute and preferably about 120 ml/minute. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</cross-reference> illustrate a portion of a lower polish module <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> in accordance with yet another embodiment of the invention. Structure or polish head <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> includes a fluid channel <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> to allow heat exchange fluid such as ethylene glycol and/or water to flow therethrough to cool a surface of a polishing surface <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> such as a polishing pad. Module <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> is suitably formed of material having a high thermal conduction coefficient to facilitate control of the processing temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Lower polish head <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> includes a top plate <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, channel plate <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>, manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight>, and a bottom plate <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>, which are coupled together to form polish head <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. Top plate <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> includes a substantially planar top surface to which a polishing surface <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> such as a polishing pad is attached&mdash;e.g., using a suitable adhesive. Channel section <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> includes channel <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> to allow heat exchange fluid to flow through a portion of polish head <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. The manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> is designed to distribute slurry through conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> from a slurry delivery tube <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> as more fully explained below. Bottom plate <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> is configured for attachment of the polish head <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> to a shaft. To allow slurry distribution through polish head <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, top plate <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, and channel section <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> each include corresponding conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> (similar to channels <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>), through which a polishing solution or slurry may flow. In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the invention, top plate <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> is brazed to channel section <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> and the combination of top plate <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> and channel plate <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> is coupled to bottom plate <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> using clamp ring <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight>, or alternatively another suitable attachment mechanism such as bolts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Heat exchange fluid is delivered to polish head <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> through a fluid delivery conduit <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight> and a flexible fluid delivery tube <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight>. Fluid circulates through channel <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and exits at outlet <highlight><bold>930</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In an alternative embodiment, the channel groove is formed in the underside of the cover plate. The channel groove may be sealed by attaching a circular disk having a planar top surface to the underside of the cover plate. The bottom section is attached to the circular disk, or, alternatively, the junction of the circular disk and the bottom section could be combined. In either this case or the illustrated case, a channel groove through which a heat exchange fluid can be circulated is formed beneath the substantially planar surface of the platen assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In accordance with yet another embodiment of the invention, the temperature of the polishing process may be controlled by providing a heat exchange fluid to the backside of a wafer. Apparatus for exposing a heat exchange fluid to the backside of a wafer are well known in the art. For an example of an apparatus configured to regulate the polishing rate of a wafer by backside heat exchange, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,488, issued to Ohashi et al. on Feb. 25, 1997, which patent is hereby incorporated by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Fluid, typically slurry or deionized water, may be distributed to lower polish head <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> using a flexible slurry delivery tube <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight> and a slurry delivery conduit <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> to deliver the fluid to a manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight>. Fluid is then distributed to a top surface of polish head <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> using conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> through the top plate <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> and channel section <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>. The top plate <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> and channel section <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> may be considered the same as a platen <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. The platen <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> supports the polishing surface <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight> and has a plurality of conduits <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> for allowing a fluid to pass through the conduits <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> in the platen <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and, preferably, through corresponding conduits <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> in the polishing surface <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. This allows the fluid to reach the working area of the polishing surface <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. The platen <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> may comprise several layers (<highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) for performing additional functions not directly related to the distribution of fluids to the polishing surface <highlight><bold>804</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> controls the fluid distribution to the conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> that allow the fluid to pass through the platen <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> and the polishing surface <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> uses a plurality of channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> in controlling the fluid distribution to the conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> of the platen <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>. The channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> may be formed by removing material from a monolithic manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight>. For example, the channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> may be formed by machining or etching the channels into the manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> The volume of the channels is preferably substantially reduced from the volume of the channels in the prior art. As an example for one embodiment of the invention, less than a third, and most preferably less than a tenth, of the top surface area of the manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> is covered by the channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>. Reducing the width and volume of the channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> reduces the time for a fluid change over. In addition, the channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> have a laminar flow compared to the turbulent flow of the prior art, which also assists in reducing the time for a fluid change over. Reducing the fluid change over time improves process flexibility in changing fluids during the planarization process. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> illustrates the results from an experiment for a fluid transition time from one fluid to another fluid using a prior art fluid distribution method. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> illustrates the great reduction in fluid transition time from one fluid to anther fluid using the manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of the invention the channel cross-sectional area at substantially every point in the channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> is greater than, preferably between 1.1 and 10 times, the combined cross-sectional area of all the conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> being serviced by the channel <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>. In another embodiment the cross-sectional area for channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> leading to a subgroup of the plurality of conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> is about 1.5 times the cross-sectional area of the combined conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> in the subgroup and the channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> leading to a single conduit <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> are about 2 times the cross-sectional area of the single conduit. The channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> leading to a single conduit <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> are made slightly larger to allow for easier machining of the channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> and to allow particles in the fluid to more easily pass through the channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>. Thus, there is a progressive reduction in channel <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> cross-sectional area as a channel <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> feeds fewer and fewer conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> have larger cross sections than the conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> causing the conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> in the platen <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> to be the most restrictive feature in the fluid flow path. The progressive reduction in channel <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> size and restrictive conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> assist in producing a more uniform backpressure in the manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight>. The uniform backpressure results in a more uniform velocity of fluid flow through the channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> and to the surface of the polishing surface <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The substantially uniform fluid velocity throughout the channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> reduce the effect of any motions imparted on the manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight>. It should be noted that an equivalent result may be obtained by controlling the cross-sectional area of the conduits in the polishing surface <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> while making the cross-sectional area of the conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> in the platen <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> larger than the cross-sectional area of the conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> in the polishing surface <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. This would result in the conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> in the polishing surface <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> being the most restrictive feature in the fluid flow path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> The slurry delivery conduit <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> communicates fluid from a fluid source (not shown) to the channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> in the manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight>. The slurry delivery conduit <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> is preferably in fluid communication with a central area <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> of the manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> that feeds the plurality of channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>. The slurry delivery conduit <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> may be in fluid communication with a plurality of fluid sources so that a plurality of different fluids, preferably one at a time, may be communicated to the channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> as desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> may be used in combination with platens that are stationary or that move in a variety of directions. For example, the manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> may be easily used to control the fluid distribution with platens that are rotated or orbited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, in operation, a fluid may be distributed across a polishing surface <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> by pumping a fluid from a fluid source to a central area <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> connected to a plurality of channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> in a manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight>. (Step <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight>) The fluid is communicated through the plurality of channels <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight> in the manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> to a plurality of conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> in a platen <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight>. (Step <highlight><bold>1401</bold></highlight>) The fluid travels through the conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> in the platen <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>908</bold></highlight> and through the polishing surface <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, preferably through corresponding conduits <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> in the polishing surface <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, to reach a working area of the polishing surface <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. (Step <highlight><bold>1402</bold></highlight>) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> The slurry distribution manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> and method of using the slurry distribution manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> produce several advantages over the prior art. The manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> greatly improves the uniformity of slurry delivery to the polishing surface <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>, even under various motions, thereby decreasing wafer non-uniformity. The lower non-uniformity leads to improved die yields. A common problem in the prior art is that additional slurry must be used to insure that all areas of the polishing surface <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> have sufficient slurry. Less slurry may be used by improved control over the slurry distribution resulting in a lower cost of ownership. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> is that greater flexibility in tuning the slurry may be achieved. The channels may be designed to produce uniform slurry delivery or the channels may be designed to direct additional slurry to areas that will benefit the particular polishing process. The slurry delivery may be tuned by plugging holes in the manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> (or platen or polishing surface) or by replacing the manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> with another manifold that has channels that produce the desired slurry distribution. The replacement of one manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> with another manifold is a simple process that requires no other changes to the hardware and allows for easy control over the slurry distribution. A further advantage is that the manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight> adds additional rigidity in supporting the polishing surface <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> by replacing the cavity in the prior art with a preferably rigid manifold <highlight><bold>919</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates a top view of polishing surface <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention. Polishing surface <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> includes conduits or apertures <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> extending through surface <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight>. Apertures <highlight><bold>1004</bold></highlight> are suitably aligned with conduits formed within a platen (e.g., platen <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>), such that polishing solution may circulate through the platen and polishing surface <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> as described above in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8, 9A</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>B. Surface <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> may also include grooves <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight>. Grooves <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> are configured to effect transportation of the polishing solution on polishing surface <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> during a polishing process. Polishing surface <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> may also be porous, further facilitating transportation of the polishing solution. It will be appreciated that polishing surface <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> may have any suitably-shaped openings that are configured to produce a uniform or other desired slurry distribution across the surface. For example, grooves <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> may be configured to facilitate a hydroplaning action such that a wafer floats on polishing solution during a polishing process. In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the invention, surface <highlight><bold>1002</bold></highlight> is formed of polyurethane, having a thickness of about 0.050 to about 0.080 inches, and grooves <highlight><bold>1006</bold></highlight> are formed using a gang saw, such that the grooves are about 0.015 to about 0.045 inches deep, with a pitch of about 0.2 inches and a width of about 0.15 to about 0.30 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a polishing apparatus <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> suitable for polishing a surface of a wafer in accordance with another exemplary embodiment of the invention. Apparatus <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> includes a lower polish module <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, including a platen <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and a polishing surface <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> and an upper polish module <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>, including a body <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight> and a retaining ring <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>, which retains the wafer during polishing. Apparatus <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> may also include a slurry distribution apparatus to supply a polishing fluid to a top surface of lower module <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Upper module <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> is configured to cause the wafer to rotate, orbit, translate, or a combination thereof and to retain the wafer. In addition, upper module <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> is configured to apply a pressure to wafer <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> in the direction of lower module <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight>, as discussed above in reference to upper module <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>. Lower module is generally configured to move a polishing surface by rotating platen <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> about its axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Although apparatus <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> may be used to polish wafers in accordance with the present invention, apparatus <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> generally requires additional space compared to apparatus <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. In particular, the diameter of polishing surface <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> is generally about twice the diameter of wafer <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight>, whereas polishing surface <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight> of lower module <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight> is about the same size as the wafer. Additionally, because lower platen <highlight><bold>1100</bold></highlight> rotates about an axis, delivery of a polishing solution through platen <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> may be problematic. Thus, several of the advantages associated with through-platen slurry delivery may be difficult to achieve using a rotational platen system, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In operation, a wafer <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> surface is polished by moving wafer <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> using upper module <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>, while simultaneously rotating lower polishing module <highlight><bold>1102</bold></highlight> and polishing surface <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> attached thereto. In accordance with one exemplary embodiment of the invention, upper module moves wafer <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight> in both a rotational and a translational direction during the polishing process. In accordance with another embodiment, upper module <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight> orbits about an axis. </paragraph>
