<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> These teachings relate generally to wireless communications systems and methods and, more specifically, these teachings relate to spread spectrum, code division, multiple access (CDMA) communications systems that employ a pilot channel for signal acquisition and for allocating fingers of a multi-finger correlator, such as one found in a RAKE-type of receiver. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a spread spectrum system of interest to these teachings a pilot channel signal is transmitted from a base station or base site for reception by mobile terminals within an area served by the base station. The mobile terminal could be a cellular telephone or a PCS terminal. The received pilot signal is used by the mobile terminal in a searcher function for synchronization and system acquisition purposes, for allocating despreaders or correlators, as well as for mobile station demodulation processing of the data bearing channels. However, the pilot signal suffers from the same radio channel fading processes as does the normally transmitted signal. Due to the fading processes the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the received pilot signal varies as a function of time and, as a result, the use of the pilot signal for its intended purposes can be impaired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The searcher is generally used for synchronization acquisition and channel set maintenance. The synchronization acquisition procedure is intended to synchronize a local pseudo-noise (PN) generator to CDMA system time. During the set maintenance procedure the searcher identifies the multipath profile of the channel and calculates the pilot channel energy per chip to total received power spectral density ratio (Ec/Io). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A problem arises in this regard, as the searcher sample size may be, for example, 2048 chips (single dwell) or more. In this case it can be shown that several seconds may be required to compute all of the correlations and, thus, the acquisition time can be dominated by the correlation calculations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a conventional searcher operational procedure, a data processor of the mobile terminal may use the power measurement capabilities of an automatic gain control (AGC) block in order to determine if data stored into searcher memory (also referred to as a buffer) is subject to any fading (or other adverse) channel conditions. However, there are problems with this approach, as the response time and other characteristics of the AGC may not be optimum for use by the searcher function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The following commonly assigned U.S. Patents are referenced for teaching various aspects of spread spectrum searcher synchronization and acquisition: U.S. Pat. No. 5,440,597, issued Aug. 8, 1995, &ldquo;Double Dwell Maximum Likelihood Acquisition System With Continuous Decision Making for CDMA and Direct Spread Spectrum System&rdquo;, by S. Chung et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,642,377, issued Jun. 24, 1997, &ldquo;Serial Search Acquisition System with Adaptive Threshold and Optimal Decision for Spread Spectrum Systems, by S. Chung et al. Reference can also be made to U.S. Pat. No. 6,078,570, issued Jun. 20, 2000, &ldquo;Mobile Assisted Hard Hand-Off for a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) System&rdquo;, by S. Czaja et al., for teaching the use of pilot channel signal strength measurements and automatic gain control (AGC) in the context of mobile terminal hand-offs. The disclosures of these commonly assigned U.S. patents are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The foregoing and other problems are overcome by methods and apparatus in accordance with embodiments of these teachings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A code division, multiple access (CDMA) receiver includes an RF section for receiving a CDMA signal through a channel; a circuit for determining an instantaneous total received power (Io) of the received CDMA signal; and a searcher that is one of enabled for operation or disabled from operation in accordance with the value of Io. The circuit includes a comparator for comparing Io against a threshold, and for generating a searcher trigger signal only when Io exceeds the threshold or, preferably, if Io does not exceed the threshold, within some predetermined period of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The searcher includes a searcher buffer for storing Inphase and Quadrature (I/Q) samples, and in one embodiment the searcher is responsive to a trigger signal generated by the circuit for storing I/Q samples into the buffer. The circuit operates to accumulate n symbol power samples, to scale the n accumulated symbol power samples, and to compare the scaled symbol power samples to a reference value, If the scaled symbol power value is above the reference value, the circuit generates the trigger for the searcher to cause the searcher to begin storing the Inphase and Quadrature (I/Q) samples into the searcher buffer. If the scaled symbol power value is below the reference value, the circuit iterates, that is, it repeats the process of accumulating, scaling and comparing the signal power samples, and if the scaled symbol power value does not exceed the reference value after x repetitions, generates the trigger for the searcher to cause the searcher to begin storing the I/Q samples into the searcher buffer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In another, more preferred embodiment the Inphase and Quadrature (I/Q) samples are stored into the searcher buffer while the Io calculation is performed. In this embodiment, and if the trigger signal is generated, the searcher buffer already contains I/Q samples that are ready to be processed by the searcher. In this case the generation of the trigger signal initiates the processing of I/Q samples stored in the searcher buffer. As with the first described embodiment, if the scaled symbol power value does not exceed the reference value after x repetitions the trigger signal is generated and causes, in this embodiment, the searcher to begin processing the stored I/Q samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment the I/Q samples are stored and the Io calculations are done on the fly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment the I/Q samples are stored in the searcher buffer, and the trigger is used to selectively identify a portion of the searcher buffer that stores samples corresponding to the maximum instantaneous Io. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The performance of the searcher using the Io trigger and timing window in accordance with these teachings has been found to be improved at all vehicle speeds. The performance of the searcher at certain speeds may be further improved by decreasing the AGC constant or by increasing Io detector times. Also, the use of vehicle speed detection may improve the performance of the searcher.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> By way of introduction, these teachings use instantaneous power measurement information (Io), as opposed to measured Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) information from an AGC block, to optimize the searcher data acquisition operation. In the searcher data acquisition algorithm (as well as during set maintenance), the instantaneous measured Io and an appropriate time window are used as a trigger in the searcher operations. Note that the details of the searcher algorithm per se are not particularly germane to an understanding of these teachings, and any one of a number of searcher algorithms could be used, including those referenced above in the commonly assigned U.S. patents. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a receiver portion of a mobile terminal <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, specifically an antenna <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> coupled to an RF section or block <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Outputs of the RF block <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are digitized by analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and provided as Inphase (I) and Quadrature (Q) channel signals to a CDMA core unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A symbol power (SymPower) output of the CDMA core unit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is input to a receive AGC (RX_AGC) block <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and to an Io detector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The RX-AGC block <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> feeds a gain control signal back to the RF block <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in a conventional manner. A searcher block <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> also receives the I and Q signals as inputs. In accordance with an aspect of these teachings, the Io detector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> outputs a timing (trigger) signal to the searcher block <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, as will be described in greater detail below. The RX_AGC block <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the Io detector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the searcher <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may all be implemented by a suitably programmed digital signal processor (DSP) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, or these functions could be implemented using dedicated hardware. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The following discussion is made in the context of certain specific parameters having certain values or ranges of values. It is to be understood that these are exemplary of the practice of these teachings, and are not intended to be construed in a limiting sense upon the practice of these teachings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A minimum requirement for the CDMA mobile receiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to receive a CDMA signal may be from levels &minus;104 dBm to &minus;25 dBm. The CDMA RX_AGC block <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is designed to maintain the input signal at a constant level at the input of the ADCs <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by controlling various gains in the RF unit <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, such as the gain of a low noise amplifier (LNA). The time constant of the RX_AGC block <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is set so as to allow compensation of slow fading, but not fast fading. However, the inventors have realized that the symbol power (SymPower) output from the CDMA core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the RX_AGC block <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can provide nearly instantaneous channel information for a communication channel that is in a rapid fade, i.e., one that would not normally be compensated for by the AGC block <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> gain control signal. In this case, Io can be used, in one embodiment, to trigger the loading of data into a Fast Searcher RAM (FSR) <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A, associated with the searcher (correlator) <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, in order to improve the performance of the acquisition and set maintenance operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In a fading channel, and if Io always indicates &ldquo;fading&rdquo;, it is instead preferred to delay the operation of the searcher <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. However, an appropriate timing window is required in order to force the searcher <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to operate, if required, in order to limit the acquisition time. In this case a compromise is preferably made between the acquisition performance and the acquisition time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In general, it is desirable to reduce the delay due to repetitions of the trigger generation algorithm versus fading. A small delay, leading to an improved acquisition time, and depending on vehicle speed, can lead to greatly improved performance, when measured in terms of detection probability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiment, and by example, eight SymPower samples (0.42 ms) are accumulated by the Io detector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in order to obtain Io, and the maximum Io monitoring time can be less than about 10 milliseconds. In this case the acquisition time, resulting from the use of these teachings, can become shortened to the point that it may be ignored. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> the received R&times;I and R&times;Q samples are squared and summed (I<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus;Q<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>), and then integrated two samples per chip over a 64 chip period in the CDMA core <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Referring also to the logic flow diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, the DSP <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> reads the integrated signal power, SymPower, every symbol at a 19.2 KHz rate. At Block A the Io detector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> accumulates n SymPower samples, and the accumulated value of SymPower is scaled and then compared to a reference signal value used in the RX_AGC <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, such as a value used to control the AGC gain. At Block B the comparison is made, and if the scaled SymPower value is above the reference value, the searcher <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> I/Q storing process is triggered at Block C. If the scaled SymPower is below the reference value, the Io detector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> runs again and repeats the above comparison and trigger procedure, via Block D. In Block D the searcher <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is arranged to trigger the I/Q storing process into the FSR <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A after some predetermined number (&num;) of repetitions of Io detection, such as five repetitions, even if the result of the Io detector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is still below the reference value. At Block E the searcher <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is enabled for operation, i.e., the searcher algorithm is run, using the stored samples. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</cross-reference> illustrates another, more preferred method. Note that in this method Block A is modified to perform the Io calculation and to also store I/Q samples into the searcher buffer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A, and that Block C is modified so as to trigger the processing of the I/Q samples that are stored in the searcher buffer. As with the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, Block C can be reached by Io exceeding the reference value, or by the Io detection timeout occurring in Block D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment of these teachings the I/Q samples may be stored in the searcher buffer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A, and the Io trigger is then used to select a portion of the buffer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A that stores samples corresponding to the maximum instantaneous Io. In this regard, the sum (I<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>&plus;Q<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>) can be computed over, by example, four consecutive segments of the received signal, and the sum having the largest value can be used to identify the segment of data in the searcher buffer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A on which the searcher <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> should be enabled for operation. That is, in this embodiment value of Io is determined over a number of samples that is less than the total size of (number of samples stored in) the searcher sample buffer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A, and is used to select samples from only a portion of the searcher sample buffer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>A for use by the searcher <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a Rayleigh channel and the resulting searcher trigger signal generated in accordance with these teachings. Note that the Io searcher trigger signal follows the variations in the channel, and that the trigger signal is enabled (active) only when the channel is above some level that corresponds to the above-mentioned threshold. If a fade occurs that exceeds a time required to perform the predetermined number of repetitions of the above-described algorithm, then the trigger signal is generated in any case. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The performance of the searcher <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> using the Io trigger and timing window has been found to be improved at all vehicle speeds (e.g., 3 km/h, 30 km/h, and 100 km/h). Also, the performance of the searcher <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> at certain speeds, such as 30 km/h, may be further improved by decreasing the AGC constant, or by increasing Io detector times. Also, the use of vehicle speed detection techniques may improve the performance of the searcher <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It should be noted that the searcher <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may operate so as to correlate the incoming samples in parallel with the operation of the Io detector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. In this case, if the result of the comparison performed by the Io detector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> indicates that the channel is less than optimum (Io&lt;ref), then the operation of the searcher <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> can be aborted, i.e., the searcher <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is disabled from operation, and the correlation results obtained at that point are simply not used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> While these teachings have been particularly shown and described with respect to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the scope and spirit of these teachings. </paragraph>
