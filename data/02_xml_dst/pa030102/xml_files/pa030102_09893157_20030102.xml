<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This disclosure relates to semiconductor fabrication, and more particularly, to methods for adjusting etch selectivity between crystallographic planes or directions in silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The extendability of deep trench based memory devices is limited by the storage capacitance of the deep trench as the ground rules shrink. Since the capacitance that can be stored in the deep trench is a linear function of the surface area of the deep trench, the formation of a larger trench is beneficial. However, widening a deep trench has a large impact on layout area of a semiconductor chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Attempts have been made to increase the surface area of a deep trench below an insulating collar, which is formed within the deep trench. The region below the insulating collar is not as limited in available area as an upper portion of the deep trench. To expand the region below the collar, an isotropic silicon reactive ion etch (RIE) process can be employed. The RIE process recesses a silicon substrate below the insulating collar to provide increased surface area. The RIE process suffers from many disadvantages. These disadvantages include: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 1. Low selectivity to oxide. With the reactive ion etch process the insulating collar is also etched thereby reducing the thickness of the insulating collar. The insulating collar is, for example, a LOCOS oxide or a deposited oxide. When this oxide is thinned vertical leakage currents may occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> 2. Expensive process. The RIE tools are expensive and have a low throughput due to the need for single wafer processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> 3. Collateral damage. The RIE process leaves polymer deposits in etched areas which may have a detrimental effect on component performance. The RIE process may cause surface damage to etched areas and undesirable side pockets may be formed in etched areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> As a result, alternate etching techniques have been employed. These etching techniques attempt to etch bottle shaped trenches by etching a silicon substrate selective to the collar oxide. These etching techniques often provide etching rates, which etch one crystallographic plane of a silicon substrate faster than another crystallographic plane. In a semiconductor memory fabrication process, this may lead to asymmetric shaped bottle-shaped portions of deep trenches. As dimensions for semiconductor devices shrink, any asymmetries may cause overlap between trenches or force a semiconductor device layout to increase in area to accommodate the need for spacings between trenches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Therefore, a need exists for an improved method for increasing surface area of deep trench capacitors. A further need exists for a method, which symmetrically forms bottle-shaped trench portions to increase the surface area of deep trench capacitors without causing overlap between adjacent trenches and without the disadvantages of reactive ion etching. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides methods for increasing the surface area of trenches formed in a semiconductor substrate by providing a wet etch process, which includes a selective deposition to adjust etch selectivity. In one embodiment of the present invention, deep trenches are formed in a monocrystalline silicon substrate. To expand the trenches, a wet etch process is employed. A wet etchant, such as a base (e.g., pH&gt;7) solution is employed to expand the trench. The wet etch process etches different crystallographic directions of the silicon at different rates, however, by first performing a selective oxide deposition. The selectivity of the wet etch can be adjusted to symmetrically expand the trench in all directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes a basic (pH greater than 7) chemistry wet etch, which may be performed in a batch tank process. The present invention also preferably creates a rectangular or, preferably, a square shaped deep trench, which provides increased surface area as compared to the RIE process which forms round trenches. The present invention will now be illustratively described in detail in terms of deep trenches. It is to be understood that deep trench technology is but one application of the present invention. The present invention may be employed with other structures formed in silicon substrates, for example shallow trenches for shallow trench isolation (STI) structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring now in specific detail to the drawings in which like reference numerals identify similar or identical elements throughout the several views, and initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> memory device <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> includes a substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> having a pad stack <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> formed thereon. Memory device <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> may include a dynamic random access memory (DRAM), synchronous DRAM, static RAMs, and read only memories or other integrated circuits. Substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is preferably a monocrystalline silicon substrate, however other substrates may be employed, for example, a silicon-on-insulator substrate. Pad stack <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> may include various layers of materials used to further process memory device <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, pad stack <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> includes an oxide layer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and a nitride layer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> A hard mask layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is deposited on pad stack <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. Hard mask <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is patterned using lithographic techniques known to those skilled in the art. For example, a resist layer may be deposited on hardmask layer <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, exposed and developed to open up holes at locations where trenches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> will be formed. Formation of trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is preferably formed by employing an anisotropic etch, such as a reactive ion etch (RIE). Trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is etched into substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that a buried plate may be formed prior to or after the expansion of the trenches in accordance with the present invention. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> method for forming buried plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) before expansion of the trench may be employed. After removing hardmask <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> may preferably be lined with arsenic silicate glass (ASG) layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (other dopant sources may be employed as well), serving as a dopant source for forming buried plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. A resist layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> (or equivalent) may be formed over ASG layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> to fill trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Resist layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is etched back and ASG layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is etched such that ASG layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> lines trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> at a lower portion only. Resist layer <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> is then removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> buried plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is formed by annealing device <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> to drive dopants into substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from ASG layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Buried plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> functions as one of the two capacitor electrodes employed in a trench capacitor. ASG layer <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, a</cross-reference> nitride layer <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> is deposited to preferably about 50 &Dgr; in thickness. A resist material (not shown) is deposited within trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> and recessed to mark a location where a collar is to be formed in later steps. Exposed portions of layer <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> are removed, and then the remaining resist material is removed from trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. A collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is formed in an upper portion of trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is formed on substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> preferably by performing an oxidation process(for example a local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS)) of the silicon in substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Layer <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight>, preferably a nitride, protects lower portions of trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> from this oxidation (since nitride acts as a barrier). Other processes may be employed to form collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> as well. For example, a TEOS deposition process may be employed. Collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is formed to prevent parasitic leakage currents from discharging the trench capacitor in operation. Remaining portions of layer <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> are removed selective to collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may be annealed to densify the oxide material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, in another embodiment, a self-aligned method for forming buried plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) prior to expanding the trench may be employed. After removing hardmask <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>), trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> may be lined with an arsenic silicate glass (ASG)/TEOS stack <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, serving as a dopant source for forming buried plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). The thin TEOS layer(or equivalent) may be formed over the ASG layer (or other dopant source material) to form stack <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. A nitride liner <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is then deposited, and trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is filled with a resist <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight>. Resist <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is etched back to define a lower portion of a collar to be formed in a later step. Stack <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are removed to the defined lower position where the collar will be formed. Resist <highlight><bold>123</bold></highlight> is then removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Referring to <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, a buried plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> and collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> are formed by oxidizing device <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> to drive dopants into substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> from ASG of stack <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to form buried plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Buried plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> functions as one of the two capacitor electrodes employed in a trench capacitor. The ASG/TEOS/nitride layer as described in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is formed to line trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. The nitride material of layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> is formed to protect surfaces of substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> from oxidation during collar formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is formed in an upper portion of trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is formed on substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> preferably by performing an oxidation (LOCOS) of the silicon in substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> protects lower portions of trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> from this oxidation since nitride acts as a barrier. Other processes may be employed to form collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> as well. For example, a TEOS deposition process may be employed. Collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is formed to prevent parasitic leakage currents from discharging the trench capacitor in operation. Remaining portions of stack <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> and layer <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> are removed selective to collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. Collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may be annealed to densify the oxide material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the two alternative paths (e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) for forming a buried plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> prior to expanding the trench provide the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. Collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> protects an upper portion of trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. The lower portion of trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is now processed in accordance with the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Before patterning trenches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> in substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, trench orientations were selected relative to crystallographic planes of silicon substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. By selecting the orientation of trenches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> relative to the crystallographic planes, e.g., (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) and (<highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>), anisotropic wet etching may be performed which provides expansion of the lower portions of trenches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Orientations of trenches relative to crystallographic planes will be described in detail hereinbelow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> An anisotropic wet etch process in accordance with the present invention is preferably preceded by a preparation step. The preparation step may employ a wet etch, a dry etch or other process steps capable of removing native oxygen from a surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the preparation step employs a diluted hydrofluoric (200 to 1) wet etch of surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to prepare surface for further processing. The preparation step may include other processes, such as a HF vapor etch or an H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>bake, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The preparation step creates a hydrogen-terminated surface. By reacting HF with Si, hydrogen atoms remain at surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The HF preparation process is preferably performed for between about 60 seconds to about 180 seconds (for 200:1, parts water to parts HF), however other times and concentrations may be used depending on the design and circumstances. Other preparation processes are contemplated provided a hydrogen terminated silicon surface is provided. The preparation step may be omitted in some embodiments if native oxide is removed in conjunction with other process steps. This preparation step is optional, since the preparation step may be employed simply to give a good starting point for the oxidation which follows. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, an oxidation process is performed to provide a thin oxide layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> over surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes crystallographic planes (100) and (110), as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</cross-reference>. Oxide layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> selectively forms on (100) surfaces at a faster rate than (110) surfaces. This means that a thicker oxide forms on (100) surfaces than on (110) surfaces. The orientation of trenches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is selected, in accordance with the present invention, to take advantage of selective deposition of oxide layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Oxide layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is preferably formed by a thermal oxidation process, which provides a thickness which is sufficient to delay etching of silicon on (100) surfaces until the etching on (110) surfaces can catch up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> top down view taken along section line <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A is shown. A wet etch preparation step is preferably performed. The preparation step may employ a wet etch, a dry etch or other process steps capable of removing oxide layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> from surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, this includes a diluted hydrofluoric (200 to 1) wet etch of oxide layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> to remove oxide layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> from surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> in the (110) surfaces. This etch process step may include other processes, such as an HF vapor etch or an H<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>bake, for example, to reduce the thickness of oxide layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The preparation step creates a hydrogen-terminated surface on (110) surfaces. By reacting HF with Si, hydrogen atoms remain at surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The HF preparation process is preferably performed with, e.g., 200:1, parts water to parts HF, however other times and concentrations may be used depending on the design and circumstances. Since oxide layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> is thicker on (100) surfaces, a thickness of oxide layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> remains on (100) surfaces. The remaining oxide thickness on (100) surfaces is customized to provide sufficient etching delay in this crystallographic plane. A thickness of say, X, (where X may be a few nanometers, for example) may be left remaining on the (100) surfaces. This thickness is provided by the oxidation process and by the extent of the preparation wet etch. Other preparation processes are contemplated for reducing the thickness of oxide layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10, a</cross-reference> top down view taken along section line <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>A is shown. An anisotropic etch process is now performed to expand lower portions of trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. A wet etchant is employed to anisotropically etch away silicon of substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The wet etchant preferably includes a basic solution. In a preferred embodiment, ammonium hydroxide (NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>OH) is employed as an etchant (NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>OH may be diluted in water, for example 180 parts water to 1 part NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>OH), although other preferred solutions may include potassium hydroxide or other bases, e.g., solutions with a pH greater than 7). The etching process is more uniform due to the hydrogen-terminated surface created by the preparation step on (110) surfaces. (110) surfaces take longer to etch with solutions, such as, e.g., ammonium hydroxide. In other words, an etching bias exists between crystallographic planes (110) and (100). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> (100) surfaces include a selectively deposited oxide layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> remaining thereon. Silicon to silicon oxide etching selectivity when etched with ammonium hydroxide is about 1000:1. Therefore, a thinly formed oxide layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>) can be tailored to delay etching of the (100) surfaces. Other materials may be employed for layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>; however, an oxide is preferred for this application. The thickness, X, of layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> on (100) surfaces should account for the etch time needed to remove oxide layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and the etch time needed to etch (100) surfaces the same amount as (110) surfaces. This would provide substantially square-shaped expanded trench portions <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> (as seen from a layout perspective). It should be understood that etching times (and therefore oxide layer thickness) can be tailored to provide different shapes, e.g., rectangular layout shapes, etc. for trenches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. An outline of a collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is shown for the upper portion of trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The etching is preferably performed at a temperature of between about 10 EC to about 80 EC, although other temperature conditions may be used depending on the circumstances. The wet etching process may be performed for a period of time, which depends on the amount of etching desired, the temperature conditions and the concentration of the etchant. If ammonium hydroxide is employed a selectivity of greater than 1000:1 is also achieved relative to collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Crystallographic directions of substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> advantageously affect the etching process. In one embodiment, a (100) silicon surface is etched faster than a (110) silicon surface. This is advantageous since the (110) surfaces may be oriented in a direction where expansion of trenches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is less desirable, for example, expansion in a direction toward another trench. In addition, lower surface roughness and higher surface planarity are achieved due to the wet etching process. For example, by employing the wet etch process surface planarity is reduced to below 15 nm, and preferably below 4 nm over the depth of a trench (e.g., 6 microns or deeper). Other surface features may benefit from the present invention as well. This is a dramatic improvement over the surface planarity of about 20 nm achieved by conventional RIE processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Trenches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> are positioned to orient the direction of the silicon crystal in accordance with the expansion etch rates most advantageous to the design. Rectangular or square lower portions <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> of trenches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> are achieved. Also, the etch process of the present invention leaves collar <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> substantially untouched by the etching process. The wet etch process lends itself to inexpensive batch processing with high throughput and employs inexpensive chemistry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> After expansion of trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11, a</cross-reference> nitride dielectric is deposited to line trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, a storage node (not shown) is formed within trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> using methods known to those skilled in the art. Storage node is preferably formed by depositing polysilicon in trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. This may be performed in steps or all in a single process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, an alternate method of the present invention forms a buried plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> after the anisotropic wet etch process to expand trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. Buried plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> may be formed by a gas doping process. Gas doping provides dopants in a gaseous form which adsorb onto an exposed surface of substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and diffuse into substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> to form buried plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. Gas doping may include arsenic or other dopants included in a hot gas introduced into trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> After formation of buried plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, a nitride dielectric (not shown) is deposited to line trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, a storage node (not shown) is formed within trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> using methods known to those skilled in the art. Storage node is preferably formed by depositing polysilicon in trench <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, examples of trench orientations formed on semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are provided. Device <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> is formed on substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> preferably includes a monocrystalline silicon material, and the silicon of wafer <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes crystallographic planes. For the illustrative description of the present invention, planes (110) and (100) will be employed. Orientation of trenches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is selected in accordance with these crystallographic planes in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In many applications, it is desirable to provide staggered trenches or evenly distributed trenches, e.g., trenches that have a predetermined distance from all adjacent trenches. By employing a selective oxide deposition and an anisotropic wet etch, trenches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> can be expanded in lower portions <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> selective to a dielectric collar formed in an upper portion of the trench. In addition, the etch rates of (100) surfaces and (110) surfaces can be adjusted to provide a desired expanded shape in the layout. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, lower portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be expanded without the use of oxide layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Growth of lower portions <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is enhanced in the (100) plane compared with the (110) plane. Upper portions <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of trenches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> are separated by an equal distance. Lower portions <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are expanded by the wet etching of substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. An optimum usage of space is achieved with this positioning of trenches relative to crystallographic orientations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14, a</cross-reference> configuration of trenches, which may be employed in a semiconductor memory, is shown. The expansion of lower portions <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of trenches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> is provided without the use of oxide layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. For the crystallographic orientations shown, this results in a merging of portions <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> because of the higher etch rate of the (100) plane. Growth of lower portions <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is enhanced in the (100) plane compared with the (110) plane. Upper portions <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of trenches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> are separated by an equal distance. The overlapping of portions <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is disadvantageous, and renders the structures useless. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15, a</cross-reference> trench configuration is shown which may solve the problems encountered in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. The trench configuration includes a <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> degree rotation of the substrate <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. This results in the same layout relative to crystallographic orientation as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Application of such a substrate orientation impacts the device performance of Si surface MOSFET devices and is highly disadvantageous. In addition, the rotation of wafers impacts cleaving of Si chips because of potential cracks parallel to the (110) direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, the trench configuration of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> may be used by employing the present invention. By employing a silicon oxide layer (e.g. layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>) in accordance with the present invention, growth of lower portions <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is inhibited in the (100) plane until growth in the (110) plane can catch up. This results in an inversion of the etch selectivity during the wet etch process to expand portions <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Instead of the (100) plane being etched faster than the (110) plane, in effect, the (110) plane is etched faster than the (100) plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, crystallographic etching selectivity is inverted by employing an oxide layer (e.g., layer <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>) so that trenches <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> may be formed to provide sufficient distance between lower portions <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. In this way, a staggered deep trench design may be employed without danger of overlapping expanded trenches. A staggered deep trench design (or other trench arrangements) may be employed. This results in an optimized surface area of the trench sidewall as compared to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>. In addition, Device performance of MOSFET devices is not affected due to undesired crystallographic orientation, and potential crack problems are avoided during the cleaving of chips of the wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Although described in several illustrative embodiments, the present invention is not limited by these examples. Other processes and materials may be used. For example, the insulating collar may be formed using different processes or made from different compounds, e.g., TEOS. Further, the invention is not limited to deep trenches and may be applicable to widening any trenches formed in substrates. Also, HF and NH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>OH may be employed as etchants in different combinations, substituted by other materials or used in combination with other etchants or compounds. The invention provides an anisotropic wet etch to form bottle shaped trenches or widen trenches, with at least the following advantages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> 1. High selectivity towards oxide and nitride: no collar thinning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> 2. Inexpensive process: wet batch process with high throughput and inexpensive chemistry employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> 3. Higher storage capacitance: square or rectangular shaped trenches are formed, which have higher capacitance than a round or oval shaped trench of the same depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> 4. Lower surface roughness: due to the anisotropic nature of the etching, only one crystallographic orientation is prepared, which gives a very smooth surface and better than 15 nm surface planarity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> 5. Higher density trench and memory cells density is achieved due to square-shaped (or rectangular-shaped) expanded trenches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> 6. Selective expansion of the trenches without damaging a collar oxide formed in an upper portion of the trench. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Having described preferred embodiments for etch selectivity inversion for etching along crystallographic directions in silicon (which are intended to be illustrative and not limiting), it is noted that modifications and variations can be made by persons skilled in the art in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that changes may be made in the particular embodiments of the invention disclosed which are within the scope and spirit of the invention as outlined by the appended claims. Having thus described the invention with the details and particularity required by the patent laws, what is claimed and desired protected by Letters Patent is set forth in the appended claims. </paragraph>

<claim-text>forming a trench in a monocrystalline silicon substrate having side walls including at least two crystallographic planes including (100) and (110) planes wherein the (100) plane is etchable at a faster rate than the (110) plane when subjected to an anisotropic wet etch; </claim-text>
<claim-text>forming an oxide collar in an upper portion of the trench; </claim-text>
<claim-text>expanding a lower portion of the trench selective to the oxide collar by: 
<claim-text>selectively growing an oxide layer on the (100) and (110) planes such that the oxide layer includes a greater thickness on the (100) plane than on the (110) plane; and </claim-text>
<claim-text>etching the oxide layer to remove the oxide layer from the (110) plane and form a hydrogen-terminated silicon surface thereon; </claim-text>
<claim-text>anisotropically wet etching the (100) and (110) planes to expand the lower portion of the trench such that an etch rate of the (110) plane is faster than a combined etch rate of the oxide layer and the (100) plane. </claim-text>
