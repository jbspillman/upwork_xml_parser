<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a system and method for monitoring and regulating dual damascene processing of a semiconductor substrate. In particular, the present invention relates to regulating dual damascene methods of forming trenches, holes and interconnects using a dual damascene process. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor industry, there is a continuing trend toward higher device densities. To achieve these high densities there have been, and continue to be, efforts toward scaling down device dimensions (e.g., at sub-micron levels) on semiconductor wafers. In order to accomplish such high device packing densities, smaller and smaller feature sizes are required. This may include the width and geometry of vias between layers, the width and spacing of interconnecting lines, spacing and diameter of contact holes, and the surface geometry, such as corners and edges, of various features. The dimensions of and between such small features can be referred to as critical dimensions (CDs). Reducing CDs, and reproducing more accurate CDs facilitates achieving higher device densities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The process of manufacturing semiconductors, or integrated circuits (commonly called ICs, or chips), typically consists of more than a hundred steps, during which hundreds of copies of an integrated circuit may be formed on a single wafer. Each step can affect the CDs of the ICs. Generally, the manufacturing process involves creating several patterned layers on and into the substrate that ultimately forms the complete integrated circuit. This layering process creates electrically active regions in and on the semiconductor wafer surface. One of the steps employed in manufacturing a semiconductor is an etch step, where selected portions of a layer (e.g., unprotected oxide layer) are removed from a wafer. Such an etch step may comprise a multi-step process that may be performed many times during the fabrication of a semiconductor. Thus, the size, shape and isolation of the electrically active regions, and thus the reliability and performance of integrated circuits employing such regions depend, at least in part, on the precision with which etching can be performed. One particular etching process is known as a dual damascene process. Conventionally, such dual damascene processes have relied on etch-stop layers and/or reproducing etch times to facilitate achieving desired etch depths for vias and/or trenches. But such conventional techniques suffer from drawbacks (e.g., additional layer, inexact/indirect control). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventional semiconductor devices typically comprise a semiconductor substrate, normally made of monocrystalline silicon, and a plurality of dielectric and conductive layers formed thereon. An integrated circuit is formed containing a plurality of conductive patterns comprising conductive lines separated by interwiring spacings, and a plurality of interconnect lines, such as bus lines, bit lines, word lines and logic interconnect lines. Such interconnection lines, made of metal interconnect materials, generally constitute a limiting factor in terms of size (width) and various functional characteristics of the integrated circuit. As such, there exists a need to provide a reliable interconnection structure having a small size yet capable of achieving higher operating speeds, improved signal-to-noise ratio and improved reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Using a dual damascene process, semiconductor devices are patterned with several thousand openings for conductive lines and vias which are filled with a conductive metal, such as aluminum or copper, and serve to interconnect the active and/or passive elements of the integrated circuit. The dual damascene process also is used for forming the multilevel signal lines of conductive metal in the insulating layers of multilayer substrate on which semiconductor devices are mounted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Due to the extremely fine patterns that are exposed on the photo resist, controlling the dual damascene process, whereby oxide and/or other conductive or insulating layers are removed, is a significant factor in achieving desired critical dimensions. Achieving greater precision in dual damascene processes can result, for example, in achieving more precise CDs (e.g., desired via depths). Thus, a system and/or method to control dual damascene processes is desired. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a system and method for monitoring and/or controlling dual damascene methods so that an etch-stop layer is not required and so that more precise control than is possible via timed etch processes is achieved. An exemplary system can employ one or more light sources arranged to project light onto one or more features and/or gratings on a wafer, and one or more light sensing devices (e.g., photo detector, photodiode) for detecting light reflected and/or refracted by the one or more features (e.g., trenches, vias) and/or gratings as the features and/or gratings are being processed by a dual damascene method. A grating is usually divided into a large number of sufficiently thin planar grating slabs to approximate an arbitrary profile. During dual damascene processing, the light reflected from the one or more features and/or gratings is indicative of at least one parameter of the dual damascene process (e.g., depth of etch, percent completion of etching) that can be measured to determine whether desired depths, diameters, profiles, critical dimensions (CDs), and so on are being achieved and to determine whether adaptations to the dual damascene process should be undertaken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> One or more etching components can be arranged to correspond to a particular wafer portion. Alternatively, one or more etching components can be employed to etch various wafer portions. The etching components may be, for example, a gas plasma apparatus employed in reactive ion etching. It is to be appreciated that any suitable etching components may be employed with the present invention. The etching components are selectively driven by the system to etch away oxide and/or other materials (e.g., in a polysilicon) at a desired location, at a desired rate, to a desired depth and/or to a desired width. The etching process is monitored by the system by comparing the etch results (e.g., CDs, depth, height, profiles) on the features and/or gratings on the wafer to desired results. Data gathered during such monitoring can be employed to determine whether an etch process employed in a dual damascene method is complete, and thus, to control the end point of such a dual damascene etch process. As a result, more optimal etching process characterization is achieved, which can reduce the time and expense of producing an etch process that can subsequently be employed to produce high quality integrated circuits. Additionally, and/or alternatively, data concerning etch process conditions that resulted in favorable and/or unfavorable CDs can be stored to facilitate reproducing favorable etch process conditions for subsequent portions of the wafer being etched and/or for subsequent wafers. In one example of the present invention, the data that is gathered is analyzed using machine learning techniques to facilitate more quickly and more accurately adapting the etch process being characterized and to facilitate more quickly and more accurately adapting subsequent etch processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention provides a system for monitoring and controlling an etch process associated with a dual damascene process. The system includes an etching component operative to etch a portion of a wafer and an etch component driving system operably connected to the etching component, where the etch component driving system is adapted to drive the at least one etching component. The system also includes a system for directing light towards gratings and/or features located on a portion of the wafer and an etch monitoring system operable to measure etching results from light reflected from the gratings and/or features. The system also includes a processor operatively coupled to the etching monitoring system and the etch component driving system, where the processor receives an etching result data from the measuring system and analyzes the etching result data by comparing the etching result data to stored etching result data. In one example of the present invention, the system also includes a scatterometry system for processing the light reflected from the one or more gratings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for monitoring and controlling an etch process associated with a dual damascene process. The method includes logically partitioning a wafer into portions, fabricating gratings to be etched on the wafer and etching the wafer. Before, during and/or after the wafer is etched, the method includes directing an incident light onto the gratings, collecting a reflected light reflected from the gratings, and analyzing the reflected light to determine etching results associated with the grating. In one example of the present invention, the method includes processing the reflected light in a scatterometry system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects of the invention are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed and the present invention is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and novel features of the invention may become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The present invention is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It may be evident, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;component&rdquo; refers to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program and a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be components. By way of further illustration, both an ion gun and a process controlling an ion gun can be components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that various aspects of the present invention may employ technologies associated with facilitating unconstrained optimization and/or minimization of error costs. Thus, non-linear training systems/methodologies (e.g., back propagation, Bayesian, fuzzy sets, non-linear regression, or other neural networking paradigms including mixture of experts, cerebella model arithmetic computer (CMACS), radial basis functions, directed search networks and function link networks) may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for monitoring a dual damascene process is illustrated. Such processes may be employed, for example, to create vias in an integrated circuit. While the illustrations associated with this application primarily depict etching occurring directly under one or more etch components, it is to be appreciated that directional etches may also be employed by the present invention. In plasma etching systems, specific gases are fed into a reaction chamber. There, the plasma creates reactive species from those gases. The etch rate is generally proportional to the concentration of the reactive species. Thus, conventional techniques may employ indirect measurements, including analyzing the reacted gases, to determine etching progress. But such techniques do not provide direct information concerning etch results (e.g., CDs, depths, profiles) being achieved on a wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> operative to direct a light <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> at a wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that is going to be etched or that is in the process of being etched. The dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be a standalone device and/or can also be distributed between two or more cooperating devices and/or processes. The dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can reside in one physical or logical device (e.g., computer, process) and/or be distributed between two or more physical or logical devices. The dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may include one or more components that are located inside a process chamber and/or one or more components that are not located inside a process chamber. The etch components <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be employed, for example, in dry-etching techniques where the mechanism of etching has a physical basis (e.g., glow-discharge sputtering, ion-milling), a chemical basis (e.g., plasma etching), and a combination of bases (e.g., reactive ion etching (RIE), ion-enhanced etching). The etch components <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be operatively connected to the dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to supply data concerning current operating characteristics (e.g., temperature, pressure, formula). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> The light <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be generated by many different light sources, and in one example aspect of the present invention the light <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is generated by a frequency-stabilized laser. The dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may direct the light <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> at substantially all of the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and/or at selected portions of the wafer. By way of illustration, in one example aspect of the present invention, the light <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be directed at selected portions of the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, where such portions provide data sufficient to generate scatterometry signatures. A light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> reflected from the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is collected by the dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which may then employ scatterometry techniques to analyze the reflected light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to determine one or more etch results achieved on the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. For example, the depth of trenches and/or interconnecting holes may be analyzed. Other parameters including, but not limited to horizontal etch rate, vertical etch rate, etch-rate percent uniformity and isotropic versus anisotropic effects may also be analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that the surface of the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, including features, can both reflect and refract the light <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, so that the light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be a complex reflected and/or refracted light. The scatterometry analysis can include comparing one or more scatterometry signatures associated with the reflected light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to one or more scatterometry signatures stored in a signature data store <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Such signatures may be generated, for example, by combining phase and intensity information associated with the reflected light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. As etching progresses, light reflecting from a wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may produce various signatures. The sequence in which such signatures are generated can be employed to determine the rate at which etching is progressing, which can in turn be employed to characterize the etch process. For example, at a first point in time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, light reflected from the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may produce a signature S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that indicates that a trench of a first depth D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> have been produced. Similarly, at a second point in time T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, light reflected from the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may produce a signature S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that indicates that trenches with a second depth D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have been produced and at a third point in time T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, light reflected from the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may produce a signature S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that indicates that trenches with a third depth D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> have been produced. Analyzing the signatures can facilitate determining when a desired depth has been achieved, thus removing the need for an etch-stop layer and/or timed etch processes, providing advantages over conventional systems. Analyzing the sequence of signatures, and the time required to produce transitions between such signatures can facilitate determining whether etching is progressing at an acceptable rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The signature data store <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can store data in data structures including, but not limited to one or more lists, arrays, tables, databases, stacks, heaps, linked lists and data cubes. The signature data store <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can reside on one physical device and/or may be distributed between two or more physical devices (e.g., disk drives, tape drives, memory units). Analyses associated with the reflected light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and/or the signatures stored in the signature data store <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be employed to control one or more etching components <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. For example, analyses associated with the reflected light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be employed to terminate the processing of the etching components <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. It is to be appreciated that the etching components <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can include, but are not limited to, isotropic and/or anisotropic etching components. It is to be further appreciated that the etching components <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be employed to remove exposed regions of a positive photoresist mask and/or unexposed regions of a negative photoresist mask using techniques like reactive ion etching, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The precision with which resist portions are removed to create vias and interconnecting holes and the resulting precision in the distance between the remaining portions corresponds to the precision with which desired profiles, depths, CDs, etc. are achieved. Therefore, the precision of the processing performed by the etch components <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is directly related to the feature sizes and CDs that can be achieved on the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Gathering real time etch process data facilitates determining the effect of controlling the etch components <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and thus facilitates more quickly and more accurately determining desired etch component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> adaptations that will result in higher quality ICs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, measurements that may affect signatures generated by a scatterometry system associated with monitoring and/or controlling a dual damascene process are illustrated. Controlling such measurements (e.g., width, depth, diameter, thickness) can be important to reliable and efficient operation of an integrated circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> A wafer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is illustrated with two features <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, between which there is a gap. The gap may have a depth of distance D<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, where the depth D<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> includes the depth D<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and the depth D<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Conventionally, controlling the depths D<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and/or D<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and thus the depth D<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, may have required an etch-stop layer, to prevent the depth D<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> from becoming too large. But including an etch-stop layer complicates, and thus makes more expensive, the fabrication of integrated circuits employing such etch-stop layers. Also conventionally, controlling the depths D<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and/or D<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and thus the depth D<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> may have relied on pre-computed etch times. But such pre-computed etch times rely on indirect observation and do not account for wafer-to-wafer and/or feature-to-feature variations. Thus, the present invention employs scatterometry techniques to monitor the depths D<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and to control the etch process(es) employed to create gaps with such depths. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> While the depths D<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> are being monitored and controlled, horizontal distances may also be monitored, with such monitoring contributing to the control of the dual damascene process. Thus, the wafer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is illustrated with two features <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. The feature <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is illustrated with an oxide layer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and a hardened photoresist layer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the feature <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is illustrated with an oxide layer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and a hardened photoresist layer <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. While the oxide layers <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> are separated by a distance D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, this distance may, for example, be too small for reliable operation of the integrated circuit being fabricated on the wafer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. A desired critical dimension for the distance between the oxide layer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and the oxide layer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be the distance D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. For example, a gap of size D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be required to facilitate fabricating a connecting line. Lithography sufficient to harden the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> may have been achieved in earlier fabrication steps, but such precise lithography may go to waste if precise etching of the features <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> can not be achieved. For example, sophisticated lithography may have produced the hardened photoresist <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> with a desired width of D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Similarly, sophisticated lithography may have produced the hardened photoresist layer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> with a desired width of D<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which should suffice to facilitate etching the oxide layers <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> if precise etching control is possible. But if precise etching control is not possible, then the distance D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be maintained, and reliable operation may not be achieved and/or the connecting line may not be able to be created. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention facilitates generating information concerning measurements (e.g., the distances D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>) and the resulting topographies of layers. Scatterometry-based real time control of the features <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, and thus the gap between the features <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, which may be employed for an interconnecting line, can be employed to control an etch process associated with a dual damascene process, and to determine the desirability of adaptations to one or more etch parameters (e.g., temperature, formula, angle, direction, pressure). Such information, generated, at least in part, in response to in situ reflected light being analyzed by scatterometry techniques can be employed to generate process history data that can be employed to adapt future etch processes that are characterized by machine learning techniques that have access to such history data, thus providing advantages over conventional systems. For example, one or more signatures associated with the wafer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and/or the features <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> can be generated. At a first point in time T<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a signature S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be generated that indicates that desired critical dimensions have not been achieved. Thus, an etching process may be adapted in an attempt to achieve the desired critical dimension. Then, at a second point in time T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a signature S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be generated that indicates that although the desired critical dimensions have still not been achieved, that progress toward the desired critical dimensions have occurred. The etching process may then be continued until a later point in time T<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, when a signature S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> indicates that the desired critical dimensions have been achieved. But the signature S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may have indicated that the adaptation to the etching process produced a movement away from desired critical dimensions, and thus the etch process may have been terminated, and the wafer marked for discard, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Prior Art FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> illustrate one conventional method of dual damascene processing that employs an etch-stop layer. The present invention facilitates performing an analogous dual damascene process (illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>) where the etch-stop layer is not required due to etch monitoring and controlling provided by a scatterometry based system. With regard to the description of the embodiment of Prior Art FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the term substrate includes not only a semiconductor substrate, such as semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, but also any and all layers and structures fabricated over the semiconductor substrate up to the point of processing under discussion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Prior Art FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> illustrate a method in connection with forming interconnections that make electrical contact to a metal structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> within a semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, where the method includes an etch-stop layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. However, the method of Prior Art FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be used to form interconnects for other purposes. For example, the method of Prior Art FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be adapted to making electrical contacts to various device structures, active elements and passive elements including polysilicon gates, wordlines, source regions, drain regions, bit lines, bases, emitters, collectors, conductive lines, conductive plugs, diffusion regions, etc. The method of Prior Art FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be used with any suitable semiconductor technology including but not limited to NMOS, PMOS, CMOS, BiCMOS, bipolar, multi-chip modules (MCM) and III-IV semiconductors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Referring to Prior Art <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a metal structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided. Semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include any suitable semiconductor material, for example, a monocrystalline silicon substrate. Metal structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be any structure to which an electrical contact is desired, for example, a copper line. An insulation material layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, such as silicon nitride, is formed over the substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The insulation material layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may act as an etch-stop layer. The present invention facilitates mitigating problems that the etch-stop layer is designed to mitigate, and thus, the present invention facilitates performing a dual damascene process without the etch-stop layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The insulation material layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may include one or more of silicon dioxide, silicon oxynitride, boronitride, silicon boronitride and silicon carbide, for example. The insulation material layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may be formed to any suitable thickness using any suitable technique, for instance, using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques. CVD techniques include low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) or plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). In one embodiment, the thickness of the insulation material layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> may range, for example, from about 500 &angst; to about 2,500 &angst;. The insulation material layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> subsequently serves as an etch stop layer for the later described low K material layers, as well as a barrier layer for the metal structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, such as BCB, is formed over the insulation material <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may alternatively include one or more of polyimides, fluorinated polyimides, polysilsequioxane, parlene F, parlene N, amorphous polytetrafluoroethylene and Flare&trade; from AlliedSignal, for example. Low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be formed to any suitable thickness using any suitable technique that may depend, for instance, on the material or materials used. In the case of BCB, a spin on technique is useful. Also in the case of BCB, the thickness of the low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may range, for example, from about 5,000 &angst; to about 10,000 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that although Prior Art FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> describe a wafer with several specific layers, that the dual damascene process described in Prior Art FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> may be employed with other combinations of layers, and thus, the present invention is not limited to layer configurations described in connection with Prior Art FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> A hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such as a layer of silicon dioxide, is deposited over the low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> using suitable techniques, such as CVD techniques. The hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may alternatively include one or more of silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, boronitride, silicon boronitride and silicon carbide. The thickness of the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may range, for example, from about 500 &angst; to about 2,500 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> An ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is deposited over the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The thickness of the ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may range, for example, from about 500 &angst; to about 1,500 &angst;. In this embodiment, the thickness of the ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is about 1,000 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Referring to Prior Art <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are patterned to define a preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> over at least a portion of a device structure, active element or passive element, or the metal structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in this instance. Any suitable patterning technique may be used to define the preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. For example, standard photolithographic techniques may be used. In particular, the ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is exposed to radiation and developed to provide a patterned photoresist. The patterned photoresist is formed using electromagnetic radiation having a relatively small wavelength (for example, less than 365 nm). In this embodiment, electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength of about 11 nm is employed. Either the exposed or unexposed portions of the ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are removed or developed to provide the patterned photoresist exposing a corresponding portion of the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> The exposed portions of the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are etched anisotropically to further form preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> exposing at least a portion of the low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The patterned ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may then be stripped from the substrate, and the substrate may be optionally cleaned to remove residue from preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Since the ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has a thickness about 2,000 &angst; or less, the stripping process does not materially effect the conformation of the low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or the preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may be formed to have any desired cross-section, width or diameter, such as about 0.1 &mgr;m or less, including about 0.09 &mgr;m or less, about 0.075 &mgr;m or less and about 0.05 &mgr;m or less, primarily depending upon the wavelength of radiation employed. The preliminary contact openings <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> serve to define subsequently formed contact holes. Conventionally, controlling such cross-section, width and/or diameter may involve indirect monitoring and/or control (e.g., timed etches, analyzing reacted gasses, etc.), which do not provide as precise a control as is possible with the scatterometry based system described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Referring to Prior Art <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> second low k material layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be formed to any suitable thickness using any suitable technique over the substrate, including over the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the exposed portion of the low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, another BCB layer is formed by spin on techniques. Also in this embodiment, the thickness of the second low k material layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may range, for example, from about 5,000 &angst; to about 10,000 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> A second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, such as a layer of silicon dioxide, is deposited over the second low k material layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> using suitable techniques, such as CVD techniques. The second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may alternatively include one or more of silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, boronitride, silicon boronitride and silicon carbide. The thickness of the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may range, for example, from about 500 &angst; to about 2,500 &angst;. In this embodiment, the thickness of the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is about 1,000 &angst;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> A second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is deposited over the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The thickness of the second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may range, for example, from about 500 &angst; to about 1,500 &angst;. The second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> subsequently serve as a trench mask for forming a trench over a plurality of contact holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Referring to Prior Art <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are patterned to define a trench mask over at least a portion of a device structure, active element or passive element, or the metal structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in this instance. Any suitable patterning technique may be used to define the trench mask in the second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, standard photolithographic techniques may be used. In particular, the second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is exposed to radiation and developed to provide a patterned photoresist. The patterned photoresist is formed using electromagnetic radiation having a relatively small wavelength (for example, less than 365 nm). Either the exposed or unexposed portions of the second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are removed or developed to provide the patterned photoresist exposing a corresponding portion of the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the trench region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The exposed portions of the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are etched anisotropically to further form the trench exposing at least a portion of the second low k material layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Conventionally, controlling such etching may include employing timed etches and/or analyzing reacted gasses. Such indirect methods do not provide as precise a control as the scatterometry based system described herein. The trench may be formed to have any desired cross-section, width or diameter, such as about 0.25 &mgr;m, about 0.18 &mgr;m, about 0.15 &mgr;m, about 0.13, about 0.1 &mgr;m, about 0.075 and/or about 0.05 &mgr;m. The width of the trench may depend on the resistivity of the conductive material used for creating an interconnect within the trench. The width of the trench is typically larger than the width of previously described preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Referring to Prior Art <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, exposed portions of the second low k material layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and insulation material layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> are removed in any suitable manner to define an opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> comprised of a trench or interconnect channel over at least one contact hole formed over metal structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Any suitable etch technique may be used to etch second low k material layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and insulation material layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Preferably, a selective etch technique may be used to etch the material of low k material layers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and at a relatively greater rate as compared to the rate that the material of the insulation material layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and/or second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are etched. In other words, the insulation material layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> serves as an etch-stop layer when etching low k material layers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Including such an etch-stop layer increases the complexity, and thus the cost, of the wafer upon which the integrated circuit is formed. Portions of the low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and second low k material layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are typically etched in an anisotropic manner using an oxygen containing gas exposing a portion of the insulation material layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The exposed portion of the insulation material layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is etched in an anisotropic manner using a suitable gas mixture, primarily depending upon the composition of the insulation material layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> exposing at least a portion of the metal structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may then be stripped from the substrate, and the substrate may be optionally cleaned to remove residue from the opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. However, since the second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> has a thickness about 2,000 &angst; or less, the second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is typically removed during removal of portions of the low k material layers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> where an oxygen containing gas is used as an etchant. In a preferred embodiment, therefore, the insulation material layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> contain different materials to afford etch selectivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Referring to Prior Art <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8, a</cross-reference> suitable conductive material or materials is formed or deposited over the substrate, including filling the opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and over the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, an optional barrier layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and a conductive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are deposited over the substrate. The optional barrier layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may serve as a diffusion barrier preventing materials from the conductive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> from diffusing into the low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and/or second low k material layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The optional barrier layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is formed over the substrate so that it covers the side walls and bottom in the opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The barrier layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be formed using any suitable technique to a thickness sufficient to serve as a diffusion barrier for conductive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For example, the thickness of the barrier layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may be in the range from about 300 &angst; to about 500 &angst;. The barrier layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is a conductive layer containing, for example, tantalum, tungsten, titanium, alloys, silicides, and/or nitrides thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> Referring to Prior Art <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, conductive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is planarized to the surface of the barrier layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>; that is, portions of the conductive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are removed from the top surface of barrier layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> above the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> remains substantially filled with the barrier layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and conductive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Any suitable technique may be used to planarize the substrate and may depend, for instance, on the specific identity of the material used to make the conductive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the substrate is planarized (a portion of the conductive layer is removed) using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) techniques using a polishing solution or slurry depending upon the specific identity of the materials used for the conductive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. As a result of CMP techniques, dishing may occur wherein the conductive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is removed to a level below the top surface of the barrier layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, and in some instances, to a level just below the top surface of the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The portion of the optional barrier layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, if employed, exposed over the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is removed using CMP techniques or an etch gas mixture. After the portion of the barrier layer exposed over the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is removed, the substrate may be cleaned using conventional techniques such as wet cleaning techniques. Removal of the exposed portion of the barrier layer serves to planarize the substrate while leaving undisturbed the portion of the barrier layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> surrounding conductive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. If employed, the etch gas mixture has high etch selectivity for the barrier metal as compared to a hard mask material, such as silicon oxide, which may constitute the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as well as other conductive metals such as copper or copper alloys, which may constitute the conductive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the etch gas mixture provides a selective etch such that the conductive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> serves as a mask in etching the barrier layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The etch gas mixture etches in an isotropic manner whereby there is no or very little change in side wall profile of the conductive layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that Prior Art FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> illustrate but one example dual damascene process, and that the present invention is not limited to improving the illustrated dual damascene process, but that the present invention can be employed to improve other dual damascene processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates a system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> for monitoring and/or controlling an etch process involved in dual damascene processing. The system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> operates to monitor one or more etch components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> and a wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> whereupon one or more features (e.g., vias, interconnects) and/or gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> are formed. A dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>, a processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> and an etch component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> work cooperatively to control the etch components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> and to provide feedback information concerning the geometry (e.g., depth, diameter, profile) of the features and/or gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> and the corresponding etch component <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> operating parameters (e.g., temperature, formula, angle, direction, pressure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> The etch components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> are coupled to and controlled directly by the etch component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>. The etch component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> receives information and/or instructional commands from the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> determines the content and type of information transmitted to the etch component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> according to its analysis of data received from and collected by the dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>. Thus, through the interaction of components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>, the system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> has the ability to control the etching of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. In addition, by communicating measurements relating to recently etched features/wafers to the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> can control the etching component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>, which can thus regulate the one or more etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> to facilitate obtaining more precise and improved etching processes. Thus etching errors can be mitigated and higher packing densities and smaller feature sizes can be achieved. Furthermore, rather than relying on timed etch processes and/or an etch-stop layer in a dual damascene process, the etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> can be controlled to etch until a desired depth in one or more trenches and/or vias is achieved and then to stop etching. Thus, more precise depth control can be achieved, and the need for timed etching and/or etch-stop layers is mitigated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> includes one or more etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> that are selectively controlled to facilitate controlled etching of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. One or more target light sources <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> project light onto respective portions of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. A portion of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> may have one or more gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> and/or features located on that portion. Light reflected and/or refracted by the one or more gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> is collected by one or more light detecting components <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight>, and processed by a dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> to measure at least one parameter relating to the etching of one or more features and/or the one or more gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight>. By way of illustration and not limitation, the depth and/or geometry of a trench and/or hole for an interconnecting line can be measured. By way of further illustration, spaces between portions of the grating <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> and spaces between the gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> can be measured and compared to desired critical dimensions (CDs). The reflected light is measured with respect to the incident light in order to obtain the various parameters relating to the gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> The dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> includes a scatterometry system <highlight><bold>1075</bold></highlight>. It is to be appreciated that any suitable scatterometry system may be employed to carry out the present invention, and such systems are intended to fall within the scope of the claims appended hereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A light source <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> (e.g., a laser) provides light to the one or more target light sources <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> via the dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the light source <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> is a frequency-stabilized laser, however, it will be appreciated that any laser or other light source (e.g., laser diode or helium neon (HeNe) gas laser) suitable for carrying out the present invention may be employed. One or more light detecting components <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight> (e.g., photo detector, photo diodes) collect light reflecting from the one or more gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> and/or the one or more features being etched. The dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> may also process the measured light data into a data form compatible with or understandable to the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> is operatively coupled to the dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> and receives the measured etching parameter data from the dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> records the acceptability of etching measurements associated with the respective portions of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> by examining measured etch results and comparing such measured etch result values to stored acceptable and unacceptable etch result values. The etch result values may be associated with one or more signatures stored, for example, in a memory <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>. In determining the acceptability and/or progress of an on-going and/or recently completed etch process, the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> may also determine to what extent, if any, adjustments to the etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> are desired. Upon making the determination, the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> may provide real-time feedback control to the etch process (e g., maintain, increase, stop etching). In one example of the present invention, the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> transmits this information to the etch component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>, which then makes one or more adjustments to the etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> until desired end points for the dual damascene process have been achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> As described above, the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> is also coupled to the etching component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> that directs and controls the one or more etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>. The etching component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> is controlled, at least in part, by the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> to selectively vary the operation of the respective etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>. Each respective portion of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> is associated with a corresponding etching component <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> monitors the etching of one or more features and/or one or more gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight>, and selectively regulates the etching of each portion via the corresponding etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>. The transmission and relay of information between the dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>, the etch component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> and the etch components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> facilitates generating effective real time feed back information that in turn facilitates improving IC quality by more accurately controlling the etch process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>, or central processing unit, may be any of a plurality of commercially available processors. The processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> is programmed to monitor, control and operate the various components within the system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> in order to carry out the various functions described herein. The manner in which the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> is programmed to carry out the functions relating to the present invention will be apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art based on the description provided herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> A memory <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>, which is operatively coupled to the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>, is also included in the system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> and serves to store, among other things, program code executed by the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> for carrying out operating functions of the system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> as described herein. For example, the memory <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> can hold patterns to which observed data can be compared. The memory <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> also serves as a storage medium for temporarily storing etching parameter data such as etching progress values, etching progress tables, component coordinate tables, grating sizes, grating shapes, scatterometry information, etch measurements (e.g., CDs, depth, profile info) and other data that may be employed in carrying out the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> A power supply <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> provides operating power to the system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. Any suitable power supply (e.g., battery, line power) may be employed to carry out the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, one aspect of the present invention is shown. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates the system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> being employed to measure the etching of a particular portion of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. The target light source <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> directs a light <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> incident to the surface of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. The angle of a reflected light <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>, reflected from the surface of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>, will vary in accordance with the evolving dimensions of the gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight>, and/or with the evolving dimensions of one or more features being etched in the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. Thus, by comparing the evolving dimensions of the one or more features and/or gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> to desired dimensions (e.g., desired depth, geometry), etch end points can be calculated for dual damascene processes. The one or more light detecting components <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight> collect the reflected light <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> and transmit the collected light, and/or data associated with the collected light, to the dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>. The dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> collects the reflected light <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>, and/or related data, in accordance with scatterometry techniques. The dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> then provides the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> with the data corresponding to the etching characteristics associated with the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. The data may include, for example, information relating to the dimensions of etched areas relative to, or independent of, dimensions of unetched areas, and/or surface characteristics as well as other measurements relating to the etch process. In one example of the present invention, such relationships may be employed in linear and/or non-linear machine learning techniques to adapt etch processes characterized by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> may provide direct, real-time measurements to the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>, as opposed to measurements taken according to pre-determined system schedules and measurements taken post-fabrication as is customary in conventional systems. Providing direct, real-time feedback to the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> facilitates selective adaptation of etch processes and improved etching precision over conventional methods and/or apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Turning now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, another aspect of the present invention is shown. In addition to the methods described above, a wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> may be logically partitioned into grid blocks to facilitate identifying positions or locations associated with monitoring the etch process. Obtaining such positions or locations may facilitate determining to what extent, if any, etch process parameter adjustments are necessary and whether desired dimensions (e.g., depth, diameter) have been achieved to facilitate controlling the etch process. Obtaining such information may also assist in determining problem areas associated with etch processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates a perspective view of a chuck <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> supporting a wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, whereupon one or more features and/or gratings may be formed. The wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> may be divided into a grid pattern as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Each grid block (XY) of the grid pattern corresponds to a particular portion of the wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, and each grid block is associated with one or more features, gratings and/or one or more portions of one or more gratings. The grid blocks are individually monitored for etch results. It is to be appreciated that the size and/or shape of gratings can be manipulated to facilitate analyzing different etch results. For example, for a particular layer in an integrated circuit, a CD relating to the depth of a trench may be important. Thus, the gratings can be patterned to optimize analyzing depth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, one or more gratings in the respective portions of the wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> (X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>Y<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . X<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>) are monitored for CDs produced during the etch process using reflected light, the dual damascene etch monitoring system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) and the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). Exemplary CD measurements produced during etching for each grating are shown. As can be seen, the CD measurement at coordinate X<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>Y<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>is substantially higher than the CD measurement of the other portions XY. It is to be appreciated that the wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> may be mapped into any suitable number of grid blocks, and any suitable number of gratings may formed on the wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>. Although the present invention is described with respect to one etching component <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> corresponding to one grid block XY, it is to be appreciated that any suitable number of etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> corresponding to any suitable number of wafer portions/grid blocks may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a representative table of CD measurements taken for the various grid blocks that have been correlated with acceptable CD values for the portions of the wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> mapped by the respective grid blocks. As can be seen, all the grid blocks, except grid block X<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>Y<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, have CD measurements corresponding to an acceptable CD table value (TA) (e.g., are within an expected range of etching measurements), while grid block X<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>Y<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>has an undesired CD table value (Tu). Thus, the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> has determined that an undesirable etching result exists at the portion of the wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> mapped by grid block X<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>Y<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>. Accordingly, the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> may make one or more adaptations for at least an etching component <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>7,6</subscript></highlight>, which corresponds to the portion of the wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> mapped at grid block X<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>Y<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, to attempt to produce an acceptable CD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary scatterometry system collecting reflected light. Light from a laser <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> is brought to focus in any suitable well-known manner to form a beam <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight>. A sample, such as a wafer <highlight><bold>1504</bold></highlight>, is placed in the path of the beam <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight> and a photo detector or photo multiplier <highlight><bold>1506</bold></highlight> of any suitable well-known construction. Different detector methods may be employed to determine the scattered power. To obtain a grating pitch, the photo detector or photo multiplier <highlight><bold>1506</bold></highlight> may be mounted on a rotation stage <highlight><bold>1508</bold></highlight> of any suitable well-known design. A microprocessor <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight>, of any suitable well-known design, may be used to process detector readouts, including, but not limited to, angular locations of different diffracted orders leading to diffraction grating pitches being calculated. Thus, light reflected from the sample <highlight><bold>1504</bold></highlight> may be accurately measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> In view of the exemplary systems shown and described above, methodologies that may be implemented in accordance with the present invention will be better appreciated with reference to the flow diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. While for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodology of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is shown and described as a series of blocks, it is to be understood and appreciated that the present invention is not limited by the order of the blocks, as some blocks may, in accordance with the present invention, occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other blocks from that shown and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating one particular methodology for carrying out the present invention. At <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>, general initializations are performed. Such initializations can include, but are not limited to, establishing pointers, allocating memory, setting variables and establishing communication channels. At <highlight><bold>1610</bold></highlight>, a grid map of a plurality of grid blocks &ldquo;XY&rdquo; is created. At <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight>, etching results are measured from various wafer portions mapped by the respective grid blocks XY. For example, the depth of one or more trenches and/or vias may be measured. At <highlight><bold>1630</bold></highlight>, a determination is made concerning whether all grid block measurements have been taken. If the determination at <highlight><bold>1630</bold></highlight> is NO, then processing returns to <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight>. If the determination at <highlight><bold>1630</bold></highlight> is YES, then at <highlight><bold>1640</bold></highlight>, determined etching result values are analyzed and compared against stored etching result values for the respective portions of a wafer. In an alternative example of the present invention, the determination at <highlight><bold>1630</bold></highlight> may concern whether a sufficient number of grid blocks have been measured to facilitate valid analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>1650</bold></highlight>, a determination is made concerning whether etching values are unacceptable. If etching values are acceptable, then processing continues at <highlight><bold>1660</bold></highlight> where a determination is made concerning whether desired CDs have been achieved. If desired CDs have been achieved, then processing can conclude. Otherwise, processing continues at <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight>. Thus, precise control of the end point of an etch process associated with a dual damascene process can be obtained, mitigating problems associated with timed etch steps and etch-stop layers employed in conventional systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> If unacceptable values are found at <highlight><bold>1650</bold></highlight>, processing proceeds to <highlight><bold>1670</bold></highlight> where a determination is made concerning whether further etching is warranted. By way of illustration, the unacceptable values may indicate that portions of the wafer and/or the entire wafer being processed have been damaged to such an extent that further etching is unwarranted. By way of further illustration, analysis of the unacceptable dimensions may indicate that an adaptation to the etch process is appropriate (e.g., change angle of etch). At <highlight><bold>1680</bold></highlight>, one or more adaptations to the etching components may be computed. The present iteration is then ended and the process returns to <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight> to perform another iteration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Turning now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the concept of scatterometry and how it is employed in the present invention is discussed. Scatterometry is a technique for extracting information about a surface upon which an incident light has been directed. Scatterometry is a metrology that relates the geometry of a sample to its scattering effects. Scatterometry is based on the reconstruction of the grating profile from its optical diffraction responses. Information concerning properties including, but not limited to, dishing, erosion, profile, thickness of thin films and critical dimensions of features present on the surface can be extracted. The information can be extracted by comparing the phase and/or intensity of the light directed onto the surface with phase and/or intensity signals of a complex reflected and/or diffracted light resulting from the incident light reflecting from and/or diffracting through the surface upon which the incident light was directed. The intensity and/or the phase of the reflected and/or diffracted light will change based on properties of the surface upon which the light is directed. Such properties include, but are not limited to, the chemical properties of the surface, the planarity of the surface, features on the surface, voids in the surface, and the number and/or type of layers beneath the surface. In the present invention, the intensity and/or phase of the reflected and/or diffracted light will be examined as it relates to critical dimensions desired on the wafer being etched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Different combinations of the above-mentioned properties will have different effects on the phase and/or intensity of the incident light resulting in substantially unique intensity/phase signatures in the complex reflected and/or diffracted light. Thus, by examining a signal (signature or stored value) library of intensity/phase signatures, a determination can be made concerning the properties of the surface. Such substantially unique phase/intensity signatures are produced by light reflected from and/or refracted by different surfaces due, at least in part, to the complex index of refraction of the surface onto which the light is directed. The complex index of refraction (N) can be computed by examining the index of refraction (n) of the surface and an extinction coefficient (k). One such computation of the complex index of refraction can be described by the equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>N&equals;n&minus;jk</italic></highlight>,</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> where j is an imaginary number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> The signal (signature) library can be constructed from observed intensity/phase signatures and/or signatures generated by modeling and simulation. By way of illustration, when exposed to a first incident light of known intensity, wavelength and phase, a first feature on a wafer can generate a first phase/intensity signature. Similarly, when exposed to the first incident light of known intensity, wavelength and phase, a second feature on a wafer can generate a second phase/intensity signature. For example, a line of a first width may generate a first signature while a line of a second width may generate a second signature. Observed signatures can be combined with simulated and modeled signatures to form the signal (signature) library. Simulation and modeling can be employed to produce signatures against which measured phase/intensity signatures can be matched. In one exemplary aspect of the present invention, simulation, modeling and observed signatures are stored in a signal (signature) library containing over three hundred thousand phase/intensity signatures. Thus, when the phase/intensity signals are received from scatterometry detecting components, the phase/intensity signals can be pattern matched, for example, to the library of signals to determine whether the signals correspond to a stored signature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> To illustrate the principles described above, reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 through 22</cross-reference>. Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, an incident light <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is directed at a surface <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, upon which one or more features <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> may exist. The incident light <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is reflected as reflected light <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The properties of the surface <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, including but not limited to, thickness, uniformity, planarity, chemical composition and the presence of features, can affect the reflected light <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The features <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> are raised upon the surface <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. The phase and intensity of the reflected light <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> can be measured and plotted, as shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. The phase <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight> of the reflected light <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> can be plotted, as can the intensity <highlight><bold>962</bold></highlight> of the reflected light <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. Such plots can be employed to compare measured signals with signatures stored in a signature library using techniques like pattern matching, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, an incident light <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> is directed onto a surface <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> upon which one or more depressions <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> appear. The incident light <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> is reflected as reflected light <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight>. Like the one or more features <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>) may affect an incident beam, so too may the one or more depressions <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> affect an incident beam. Thus, it is to be appreciated that scatterometry can be employed to measure features appearing on a surface, features appearing in a surface, and properties of a surface itself, regardless of features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, complex reflections and refractions of an incident light <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight> are illustrated. The reflection and refraction of the incident light <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight> can be affected by factors including, but not limited to, the presence of one or more features <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight>, and the composition of the substrate <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> upon which the features <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> reside. For example, properties of the substrate <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> including, but not limited to the thickness of a layer <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, the chemical properties of the layer <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, the opacity and/or reflectivity of the layer <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, the thickness of a layer <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>, the chemical properties of the layer <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>, the opacity and/or reflectivity of the layer <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>, the thickness of a layer <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight>, the chemical properties of the layer <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight>, and the opacity and/or reflectivity of the layer <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight> can affect the reflection and/or refraction of the incident light <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight>. Thus, a complex reflected and/or refracted light <highlight><bold>942</bold></highlight> may result from the incident light <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight> interacting with the features <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight>, and/or the layers <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight>. Although three layers <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight> are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, it is to be appreciated that a substrate can be formed of a greater or lesser number of such layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, one of the properties from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is illustrated further. The substrate <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> can be formed of one or more layers <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight>. The phase <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> of the reflected and/or refracted light <highlight><bold>942</bold></highlight> can depend, at least in part, on the thickness of a layer, for example, the layer <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>. Thus, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the phase <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight> of the reflected light <highlight><bold>942</bold></highlight> differs from the phase <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> due, at least in part, to the different thickness of the layer <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Thus, scatterometry is a technique that can be employed to extract information about a surface upon which an incident light has been directed. The information can be extracted by analyzing phase and/or intensity signals of a complex reflected and/or diffracted light. The intensity and/or the phase of the reflected and/or diffracted light will change based on properties of the surface upon which the light is directed, resulting in substantially unique signatures that can be analyzed to determine one or more properties of the surface upon which the incident light was directed. Using scatterometry in the present invention facilitates a relatively non-invasive approach to controlling an etch process by identifying when desired CDs (e.g., depth, diameter, geometry) have been achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Described above are preferred embodiments of the present invention. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methodologies for purposes of describing the present invention, but one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many further combinations and permutations of the present invention are possible. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to embrace all such alterations, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23 through 29</cross-reference>, an example of the application and benefits of scatterometry as applied to a dual damascene process is provided. One of the advantages of present invention, removal of an etch-stop layer is particularly noted. It is to be appreciated that removing the etch-stop layer is not the only advantage of the present invention, and that other advantages (e.g., more precise end point control, real time process control) are associated with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23, a</cross-reference> semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having metal structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is provided. Semiconductor substrate <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include any suitable semiconductor material, for example, a monocrystalline silicon substrate. Metal structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be any structure to which an electrical contact is desired, for example, a copper line. The present invention facilitates mitigating problems that the etch-stop layer is designed to prevent, and thus, the present invention facilitates performing a dual damascene process without an etch-stop layer (e.g., insulation layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, Prior Art <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). A low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, such as BCB, is formed. Low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be formed to any suitable thickness using any suitable technique that may depend, for instance, on the material or materials used. In the case of BCB, a spin on technique is useful. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that although FIGS. <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> describe a wafer with several specific layers, that the dual damascene process described in FIGS. <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> may be employed with other combinations of layers, and thus, the present invention is not limited to layer configurations described in connection with FIGS. <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> A hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such as a layer of silicon dioxide, is deposited over the low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> using suitable techniques, such as CVD techniques. The hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> may alternatively include one or more of silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, boronitride, silicon boronitride and silicon carbide. An ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is deposited over the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are patterned to define a preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> over at least a portion of a device structure, active element or passive element, or the metal structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in this instance. Any suitable patterning technique may be used to define the preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. For example, standard photolithographic techniques may be used. In particular, the ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is exposed to radiation and developed to provide a patterned photoresist. The patterned photoresist is formed using electromagnetic radiation having a relatively small wavelength (for example, less than 365 nm). Either the exposed or unexposed portions of the ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are removed or developed to provide the patterned photoresist exposing a corresponding portion of the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> in preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> The exposed portions of the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are etched anisotropically to further form preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> exposing at least a portion of the low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The progress of the anistropic etching can be monitored by the present invention, so that the anistropic etching will proceed until desired CDs (e.g., depth, width, diameter, geometry) are achieved. Then, the present invention facilitates terminating the anistropic etch once real time information concerning desired CDs has been analyzed and thus more precise etching is achieved. The patterned ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may then be stripped from the substrate, and the substrate may be optionally cleaned to remove residue from preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> may be formed to have any desired cross-section, width or diameter, such as about 0.1 &mgr;m or less, including about 0.09 &mgr;m or less, about 0.075 &mgr;m or less and about 0.05 &mgr;m or less, primarily depending upon the wavelength of radiation employed. The preliminary contact openings <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> serve to define subsequently formed contact holes. Since the present invention facilitates forming the preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> more precisely, subsequently formed contact holes may also be more precisely formed, providing advantages over conventional systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25, a</cross-reference> second low k material layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be formed to any suitable thickness using any suitable technique over the substrate, including over the hard mask layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the exposed portion of the low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, another BCB layer is formed by spin on techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> A second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, such as a layer of silicon dioxide, is deposited over the second low k material layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> using suitable techniques, such as CVD techniques. The second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may alternatively include one or more of silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, boronitride, silicon boronitride and silicon carbide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> A second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is deposited over the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> subsequently serve as a trench mask for forming a trench over a plurality of contact holes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference>, the second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are patterned to define a trench mask over at least a portion of a device structure, active element or passive element, or the metal structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in this instance. Any suitable patterning technique may be used to define the trench mask in the second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. For example, standard photolithographic techniques may be used. In particular, the second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is exposed to radiation and developed to provide a patterned photoresist. The patterned photoresist is formed using electromagnetic radiation having a relatively small wavelength (for example, less than 365 nm). Either the exposed or unexposed portions of the second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are removed or developed to provide the patterned photoresist exposing a corresponding portion of the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in the trench region. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> The exposed portions of the second hard mask layer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are etched anisotropically to further form the trench exposing at least a portion of the second low k material layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The trench may be formed to have any desired cross-section, width or diameter, such as about 0.25 &mgr;m, about 0.18 &mgr;m, about 0.15 &mgr;m, about 0.13, about 0.1 &mgr;m, about 0.075 and/or about 0.05 &mgr;m. The width of the trench may depend on the resistivity of the conductive material used for creating an interconnect within the trench. The width of the trench is typically larger than the width of previously described preliminary contact opening <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The present invention facilitates monitoring and/or controlling the etching of the trench and thus facilitates more precisely forming the trench. Thus, the cross-section, width and/or diameter may be more precisely controlled, leading to improvements in chip quality and/or reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, exposed portions of the second low k material layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are removed in any suitable manner to define an opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> comprised of a trench or interconnect channel over at least one contact hole formed over metal structure <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Any suitable etch technique may be used to etch second low k material layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Conventionally, an etch-stop layer (e.g., layer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, Prior Art <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>) would be employed at this point in the dual damascene process. But the present invention facilitates etching the second low k material layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the low k material layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> without such an etch-stop layer. Thus, with the removal of the etch-stop layer, a simpler architecture for the integrated circuit is achieved. The second ultra-thin photoresist layer <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may then be stripped from the substrate, and the substrate may be optionally cleaned to remove residue from the opening <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</cross-reference>, processing substantially similar to that of Prior Art <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</cross-reference> is undertaken to complete the portion of the dual damascene process. Thus, through the use of scatterometry based monitoring and control of the etching in the dual damascene process illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, a simpler wafer architecture and more precise feature forming are achieved. It is to be appreciated that FIGS. <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> illustrate but one example dual damascene process, and that the present invention is not limited to improving the illustrated dual damascene process, but that the present invention can be employed to improve other, non-illustrated dual damascene processes. </paragraph>
