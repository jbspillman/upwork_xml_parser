<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to self-propelled, ground-working vehicles such as lawn mowers and, more particularly, to operator control systems for use with the same. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Various types of lawn mowers are known. For example, small, walk-behind mowers are in general use by both homeowners and professionals alike. At the other end of the spectrum are large, riding mowers adept at mowing correspondingly large and typically unobstructed areas. Between these two categories lies what are commonly referred to as &ldquo;mid-size&rdquo; mowers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Generally speaking, mid-size mowers are self-propelled units having a cutting width of approximately 36-60 inches. While they may be configured as either riding (including ride-on and ride-behind) or walk-behind units, walk-behind mowers potentially offer greater maneuverability. For example, walk-behind mowers are particularly efficient when mowing large lawns having numerous obstacles (e.g., trees, shrubs, flowerbeds, and the like) which necessitate intricate trimming, or when mowing lawns which may otherwise be ill-suited to high-speed riding mowers. Moreover, walk-behind mowers are often used in areas with steep slopes which may pose traction or tipping problems for riding mowers. Furthermore, mid-size, walk-behind mowers are also, in general, less expensive than riding mowers. While the present invention is directed to control systems for use with either riding or walk-behind vehicles, it will, for the sake of brevity, be described with respect to mid-size, walk-behind mowers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One type of control system known for use with mid-size mowers uses two rearwardly extending handles each equipped with a scissors-type lever. Each lever operatively controls one of two drive wheels typically located at or near the rear corners of the cutting unit. Where the levers are configured as &ldquo;normally engaged,&rdquo; actuating (e.g., squeezing) one of the drive levers causes disengagement and/or braking of the corresponding drive wheel, permitting the mower to turn about that wheel. Alternatively, the levers may be &ldquo;normally disengaged&rdquo; such that actuating (e.g., squeezing) one of the drive levers causes engagement of the corresponding drive wheel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While scissors-type lever control systems are more than adequate for their intended purpose, drawbacks remain. For instance, scissors-type levers, in general, may provide limited mechanical advantage in overcoming lever tension. Accordingly, when cutting a lawn with many trees, shrubs, or other obstacles that necessitate numerous turns, discomfort in the hands, wrists, and arms may occur. Scissors-type lever control systems may also be susceptible to variation in lever tension over the lever travel. Furthermore, depending on the position of each lever within its throw, the operator may not be able to grasp the respective lever with all fingers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Other systems are also known. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,511,367 to Powers et al. and 5,809,755 to Velke et al. disclose control systems having a generally transverse hand position. While addressing some of the above-identified problems, other issues with hand position and/or control actuation potentially remain. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Control systems of the present invention seek to overcome the above-identified drawbacks by providing operator control systems that combine natural hand positioning with conveniently located drive control levers. Control systems in accordance with the present invention further provide a hand position interior to the control system to reduce potential contact between the operator&apos;s hands and external objects during operation. The drive control levers of the present invention may additionally provide substantially constant tension throughout their range of motion, resulting in drive control lever forces which are more evenly distributed throughout the operator&apos;s hands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, an operator control system for a self-propelled vehicle is provided. The control system includes a handle assembly having a first hand grip and a second hand grip, wherein the first hand grip and the second hand grip extend generally upwardly and towards one another when the vehicle is in an operating configuration. The system further includes a first control lever associated with the first hand grip, wherein the first control lever is pivotable about a first pivot axis. Preferably, the first pivot axis is substantially parallel to a first grip axis of the first hand grip. A second control lever associated with the second hand grip is also included. The second control lever is pivotable about a second pivot axis, wherein the second pivot axis is substantially parallel to a second grip axis of the second hand grip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, an operator control system for a self-propelled lawn mower is provided having a handle assembly including a first hand grip defining a first grip axis and a second hand grip defining a second grip axis. The first grip axis and the second grip axis generally approach one another above the handle assembly when the mower is in an operating configuration. The system also includes a first control lever associated with the first hand grip, where the first control lever is pivotable about a first pivot axis, the first pivot axis being substantially parallel to the first grip axis. A second control lever associated with the second hand grip is also included. The second control lever is pivotable about a second pivot axis, wherein the second pivot axis is substantially parallel to the second grip axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, an operator control system for a self-propelled, walk-behind or ride-behind lawn mower is provided. The control system includes a handle assembly having a first hand grip having a first grip axis and a second hand grip having a second grip axis. The first grip axis and the second grip axis generally intersect above the handle assembly when the mower is in an operating configuration. Further, the first hand grip and the second hand grip each form ends of the handle assembly. A first control lever associated with the first hand grip is also included wherein the first control lever is pivotable about a first pivot axis. Further, a second control lever associated with the second hand grip is provided wherein the second control lever is pivotable about a second pivot axis. The first pivot axis is substantially parallel to the first grip axis and the second pivot axis is substantially parallel to the second grip axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The above summary of the invention is not intended to describe each embodiment or every implementation of the present invention. Rather, a more complete understanding of the invention will become apparent and appreciated by reference to the following detailed description and claims in view of the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the following detailed description of the embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows an operator control system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention as the latter may be incorporated on a self-propelled vehicle, e.g., a mid-size, walk-behind lawn mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. While, for the sake of brevity, the invention is herein described with respect to a particular mid-size, walk-behind lawn mower (hereinafter generically referred to merely as &ldquo;walk-behind mower,&rdquo; or, more generally, as &ldquo;mower&rdquo;), those of skill in the art will realize that the invention is equally applicable to other walk-behind mowers, ride-behind mowers (e.g., such as those utilizing sulkies), and conventional ride-on mowers as well as to most any other walk-behind, ride-behind, or ride-on self-propelled, ground working vehicle, e.g., skid-steer loader, aerator, snow thrower, tiller, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> While the general construction of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is not considered central to the invention, it will now be briefly described. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (shown primarily in broken lines) having a frame <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> supporting a prime mover, e.g., internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. A pair of transversely opposing, ground engaging drive wheels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> (only left wheel visible) may support the rear of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in rolling engagement with the ground. Each drive wheel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> may be powered by a hydraulic motor (not shown) which receives hydraulic power from a hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) under the control of various operator-controlled valves. The hydraulic pumps <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, in turn, may be separately powered by the engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. While not illustrated, other drive systems, e.g., gear or pulley driven systems, are also within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Operator controls, as further described below, permit independent control of the speed and direction of each drive wheel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, allowing control of mower speed and direction from a walking or riding position generally aft, e.g., behind, the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A pair of front swiveling caster wheels <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, which are preferably connected to forwardly extending frame rails <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, may support the front of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in rolling engagement with the ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> As used herein, relative terms such as &ldquo;left,&rdquo; &ldquo;right,&rdquo; &ldquo;fore,&rdquo; &ldquo;forward,&rdquo; &ldquo;aft,&rdquo; &ldquo;rearward,&rdquo; &ldquo;top,&rdquo; &ldquo;bottom,&rdquo; &ldquo;upper,&rdquo; &ldquo;lower,&rdquo; &ldquo;horizontal,&rdquo; &ldquo;vertical,&rdquo; and the like are from the perspective of one operating the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> while the mower is in an operating configuration, e.g., while the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is positioned such that the wheels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> rest upon a generally horizontal ground surface as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. These terms are used herein to simplify the description, however, and not to limit the scope of the invention in any way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Although the illustrated mower has the drive wheels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in the rear and the caster wheels <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in front, this configuration is not limiting. For example, other embodiments may reverse the location of the wheels, e.g., drive wheels in front and caster wheels in back. Moreover, other configurations may use different wheel configurations altogether, e.g., a tri-wheel configuration. These and other embodiments are possible without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A cutting deck <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may be mounted to a lower side of the frame <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> generally between the drive wheels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and the caster wheels <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. The cutting deck <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> includes one or more cutting blades (not shown) as known in the art which are operatively powered by the engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. During operation, power is selectively delivered to the cutting deck <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, whereby the blades rotate at a speed sufficient to sever grass and other vegetation passing underneath the cutting deck. The cutting deck <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> may optionally include deck rollers <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> to further support the cutting deck relative to the ground during operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the operator control system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may include a first hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a second hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. To support the operator control system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, one or more structural members such as arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may extend between the frame <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the control system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, e.g., the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may extend upwardly and rearwardly from the mower frame <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). While shown and described as arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, most any comparable structure is possible without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, plate and/or sheet metal structures may be used in place of, or in addition to, the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The suffixes &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;b&rdquo; are used throughout this description to denote various left and right side parts/features, respectively. However, in most pertinent respects, the parts/features denoted with &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;b&rdquo; suffixes are either substantially identical to, or mirror images of, one another. Therefore, such items may, where appropriate, be referred to generically or collectively without the suffix, e.g., &ldquo;hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>&rdquo; may refer to either or both hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. It is understood that, unless otherwise noted, the description of an individual part/feature, e.g., the description of a part/feature identified with an &ldquo;a&rdquo; suffix, also applies to the opposing part/feature, e.g., the part/feature identified with a &ldquo;b&rdquo; suffix. Similarly, the description of a part/feature identified with no suffix applies to both the corresponding left and right part/feature, e.g., to both the part/feature identified with the &ldquo;a&rdquo; suffix and the &ldquo;b&rdquo; suffix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> form ends of a continuous handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> which may also include a substantially transverse tube member or portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and curved portions <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. As the figures illustrate, the curved portions <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> and hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may result in a generally bull-horn-shaped handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The bull-horn shape of the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> yields hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> that are preferably generally inclined upwardly and towards one another. In other words, a first grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the first grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may approach a second grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the second grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at a point above the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Preferably, although not necessarily, the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> are generally straight and lie within a common plane (e.g., the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may be coplanar with the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). In embodiments where the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> do lie within the same plane, the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may intersect the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>at a point above the grip assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. While not limited thereto, the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of each hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be inclined at an angle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) of 30 degrees to 60 degrees and, more preferably, at an angle <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of 30 to 40 degrees, measured from a respective line <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> formed by the intersection of the plane of the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and a vertical plane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may also be inclined forwardly relative to a vertical plane passing through a lowermost portion of the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, e.g., passing through a lowermost portion of the first hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, as generally indicated in the figures (see e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>). While not limited thereto, some embodiments may be configured with the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> inclined forwardly from the vertical plane at an angle <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>) of between 30 degrees and 60 degrees and, more preferably, at an angle <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> between 30 degrees and 40 degrees. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As those of skill in the art will realize, the shape and orientation of the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, e.g., the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, provides the operator with comfortable hand positioning during operation (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Further, by positioning the operator&apos;s hands interior to the periphery of the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, e.g., inboard or interior to the curved portions <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, the chance of inadvertent contact between the hands and obstacles during operation may be reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> may attach to the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> in any number of ways. For example, the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> may be welded to the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Alternatively, the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> may be fastened to the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> using, for example, mechanical fasteners, adhesives, or the like. In still other embodiments, the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may be integrally formed with the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, e.g., the ends of arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> may form the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. In the case of the latter, the transverse tube portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>, the curved portions <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, or both, may be optional. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Various control devices are mounted on or in close proximity to the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. For example, a transmission lever <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be provided to allow drive parameter selection, e.g., forward speed, while a throttle <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may be provided to control engine speed. Other controls not central to the invention, e.g., starter, choke, etc., although not illustrated, may also be provided. A cover <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> may be further included to offer a more aesthetically pleasing appearance as well as to shield various moving parts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> To control power delivery to the drive wheels <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, the operator control system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> preferably includes a first control lever, e.g., a first drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and a second control lever, e.g., a second drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, as clearly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>. The drive control levers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are coupled to respective hydraulic pumps <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> via tie rods <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. When a drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is manipulated as described below, the corresponding tie rod <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> pivots a lever arm <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> on the pump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight>, manipulating a hydraulic valve (not shown) which controls hydraulic flow to the respective drive wheel motor (also not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Each drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> preferably has a shape similar to the corresponding hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4, e</cross-reference>.g., the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, similar to the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, may have a grip portion <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>defining a lever axis <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>substantially parallel to the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the respective hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Optionally, each drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may include a curved portion <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> having a shape that generally corresponds to the shape of the respective curved portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, e.g., curved portion <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>may have generally the same radius of curvature as the respective curved portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. While the grip portion <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is described and illustrated as straight, other shapes are also possible without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Each drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may pivotally coupled to the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (e.g., to the handle assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> or, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, to the arms <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>) via a pivot assembly <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the pivot assembly <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> permits pivoting of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> about an axis substantially parallel to the respective hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, e.g., the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>pivots about a pivot axis <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that is substantially parallel to the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The tie rod <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> is coupled to the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> at a tie rod pivot <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference>) located a predetermined distance from the pivot axis <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to provide the desired tie rod movement for a given drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> movement. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Because of the substantially parallel orientation of the pivot axis <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> to the axes <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight>, the lever axis <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> remains generally parallel to the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the respective hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> throughout the range of motion of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, e.g., the grip portion <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>remains parallel to its respective hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. As a result, the force required to manipulate each drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is substantially uniform throughout the travel of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Moreover, because the lever axis <highlight><bold>227</bold></highlight> of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is parallel to the axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the operator is able to grasp the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> with most, if not all, fingers (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) regardless of the particular position of the drive control lever within its travel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> To further improve operator comfort during mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> use, each drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may have a cross section defined by one or more curved surfaces. For example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary grip portion <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with a curved, e.g., convex or semi-cylindrical, surface <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> and a generally planar surface <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. Other embodiments may include a concave surface in place of the planar surface <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> such that the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> corresponds to the shape of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> when the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is proximate thereto. Other embodiments may vary the shape or the radius of curvature of the curved surface <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the curved surface <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> permits grasping by the operator without resulting in excessive pressure at any point along the operator&apos;s fingers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> also illustrates the range of motion of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. In this figure, the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is illustrated in solid lines in a forward position identified as &ldquo;F.&rdquo; Preferably, the drive control levers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are biased towards the forward position F. The forward position F corresponds to the respective hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) providing maximum hydraulic flow for forward motion of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Each drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may also be movable to a reverse position &ldquo;R&rdquo; by squeezing the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, e.g., drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, towards the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, e.g., hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The reverse position R corresponds to the respective hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) providing maximum hydraulic flow for reverse motion of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Each drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may also be movable to any position between the forward position F and the reverse position R. In some embodiments, the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, when in an intermediate or neutral position, e.g., a position identified as N in broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, may place the respective hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) in a static configuration. That is, when the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is in the neutral position N, differential flow output from the pump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> may be effectively terminated such that no driving power is delivered to the respective wheel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. In some embodiments, the neutral position N could configure internal valving of the respective hydraulic pump <highlight><bold>107</bold></highlight> into a cross-ported configuration such that the respective wheel <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> could freewheel without substantial hydraulic resistance. As a result, the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> could, when both levers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> are in the neutral position N, be moved without starting the engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, drive control systems in accordance with the present invention provide intuitive control of mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. For instance, incremental forward movement of both drive control levers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> from the neutral position N to the forward position F results in forward propulsion of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at incrementally increasing speed. Similarly, incremental rearward motion of both drive control levers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> from the neutral position N to the reverse position R results in incrementally increasing reverse speed. By manipulating the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>independently between the forward position F and the reverse position R, the operator can control both speed and direction of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. For example, while one drive control lever, e.g., <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, may be commanded for mower movement in a first direction at a first speed, the opposite drive control lever, e.g., <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, may be commanded for mower movement in the same or opposite direction at the same or different speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> Some embodiments of the present invention may optionally include a latching device, e.g., a neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, of which one configuration is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> permits the operator to temporarily lock the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in at least one predetermined position, e.g., in the neutral position N. By permitting locking of each drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> in the neutral position N, the operator may suspend operation and release one or more secondary levers, e.g., an operator presence control (hereinafter &ldquo;OPC&rdquo;) lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> further described below, without inadvertently stopping the engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> illustrate end views of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>showing the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> in various positions relative to the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>also preferably includes a neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> (see e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) which operates in a manner generally identical to that described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> In the embodiments illustrated herein, the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is pivotable about an end of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, e.g., about a latch pivot axis <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> which may be generally parallel and preferably coaxial to the grip axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), between a locked position (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>) and an unlocked position (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> may include a hook portion <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight> for capturing the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>when the latter is in the first or neutral position N as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. To disengage the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> from the locked position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, it may be manually pivoted about the pivot axis <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> in a direction <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> to the unlocked position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. While the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, may be configured with an outwardly opening mouth, other embodiments may utilize a neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> having an inwardly opening mouth as generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. To assist the operator with pivoting the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, thumb tabs <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> may be included. Optionally, a friction-reducing member/device, e.g., a roller <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, may be provided to assist with moving the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> past to the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> To provide rotational resistance to the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, a friction device (not shown) may be incorporated. For example, the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> may be fastened to the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>with a fastener between which one or more spring disc washers as known in the art are provided. By controlling the installation torque of the fastener, the axial clamping force applied to the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> by the spring washers may be varied, thus altering the neutral lock&apos;s resistance to rotational movement. Other friction devices may also be used without departing from the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Once the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> is moved to the unlocked position illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is free to move to the forward position F as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. A pivot limiting device, e.g., ear <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, may be included with the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> to prevent engagement of the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, e.g., rotation of the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> in the direction <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight>, when the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is in the forward position F. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates the relative locations of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the neutral lock <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> when the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is in the reverse position R. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Various embodiments of operator control systems in accordance with the present invention may further include one or more operator presence control (OPC) devices as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. OPC devices are typically configured to terminate mower operation, e.g., stop the engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, in some circumstances unless operator presence is detected. In the instant invention, the OPC device may be configured as one or more secondary or OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> positioned proximate the respective hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> opposite the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, e.g., aft of the hand grip. Like the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, each OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may comprise a generally straight gripping portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and a curved portion <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight>. The gripping portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> and the curved portion <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> have shapes that may generally correspond to that of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and the curved portion <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> in accordance with the present invention may operatively couple to an interlock switch <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> (as known in the art and diagrammatically represented in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) and manipulate it between an open configuration and a closed configuration. Generally speaking, mower, e.g., engine <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, operation is disabled when the interlock switch <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> is in its open configuration and allowed when the interlock switch <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> is in its closed configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are preferably biased towards a disengaged, normally open position identified as &ldquo;O&rdquo; in broken lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The open position O preferably corresponds to the interlock switch <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> being in its open configuration (mower disabled). To operate the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, at least one of the OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may be squeezed towards the respective hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> to a closed, e.g., engaged, position identified as &ldquo;C&rdquo; in solid lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. The closed position C preferably corresponds to the interlock switch <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> being in its closed configuration (mower enabled). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> In some embodiments, the OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may be movable between the open position O and the closed position C by pivoting about an OPC pivot <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> having a pivot axis <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> that is generally transverse to a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The gripping portions <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> may each, in some embodiments, define a secondary lever axis <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight> (see e.g., axis <highlight><bold>243</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) which is substantially parallel to the axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the respective hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> when the OPC lever is in the closed position C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Preferably, one OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is associated with each hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, e.g., OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>may be provided as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may further be configured such that they form a single lever. As a result, the operator may engage the interlock switch <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> with one OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, e.g., the interlock switch may be engaged by holding either one or both OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>in the closed position C (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>). However, should the operator release both levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, they will return to their open position O, opening the interlock switch <highlight><bold>249</bold></highlight> and thus disabling the mower from further operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Like the drive control levers <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the OPC levers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may be configured to assist in reducing operator fatigue. For example, the cross-sectional shape of at least the gripping portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> (see e.g., <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) may be configured to generally correspond to the exterior profile of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in this Figure, each hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may comprise a rigid or semi-rigid core portion <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> which, in one embodiment, is made from steel or aluminum. To provide more comfortable gripping, the core portion <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may optionally be surrounded, at least in part, by a gripping layer <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight>. While not limited thereto, the gripping layer <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> may preferably be made from a compressible material such as foam rubber. As <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates, the gripping layer <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> defines an outer radius <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may define a cross-sectional shape having a surface <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> which preferably conforms to a cross-sectional shape of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> when the OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is in the closed position C (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>). In the illustrated embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, the surface <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> is concave having an inner radius <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> generally equal in size to the outer radius <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. As a result, the OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> contacts the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> along most, if not all, of the surface <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may be further defined by a convex surface <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> having a radius <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the radius <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> of the convex surface <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> is less than the radius of the concave surface <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight>, e.g., the radii <highlight><bold>291</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> have different centers. This geometry yields a crescent-shaped cross-section as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. To avoid sharp edges and to provide a smooth transition to the gripping layer <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight>, the two surfaces <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> may blend together at a radius <highlight><bold>298</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> By providing an OPC cross-sectional shape as described above and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</cross-reference>, smooth transition zones from the edges of the gripping portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> of the OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> result. Also, the eccentric surfaces <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight> result in the OPC lever gripping portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> having a non-uniform thickness, e.g., being somewhat thicker near its middle than near its edges (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>). The thicker middle portion provides the operator with a protrusion to grip during operation while the thinner edges provide a gradual transition from the gripping portion <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> to the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. As a result, the transition from the OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> produces relatively few pressure points. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> As noted above, the embodiments described and illustrated herein are exemplary only. Other configurations are certainly possible without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> may have different cross-sectional shapes, e.g., an oval. When so configured, various corresponding surfaces, e.g., the surface <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> of the OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) and/or the surface <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight> of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> (See <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) may be reconfigured to correspond to the new cross-sectional shape of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The OPC lever <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may also be configured to pivot about an axis generally parallel to the axis <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) rather than about the transverse axis <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> (see also <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) described herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> In still other embodiments, an operator control system <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be configured such that a drive control lever <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is located aft of, i.e., behind, the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. The drive control lever <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may still pivot about a pivot assembly <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> having a pivot axis substantially parallel to an axis of the hand grip <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. Movement of the drive control lever <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> may reposition the tie rod <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> as described above. While not shown, neutral locks and OPC levers may be reconfigured to accommodate this revised drive control lever structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> While not illustrated, still other embodiments may have hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> configured to extend downwardly and outwardly rather than upwardly and inwardly. That is, the hand grips, e.g., hand grips <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, may couple to the mower <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at or near their uppermost end and extend downwardly and outwardly therefrom. However, such embodiments may still result in axes <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>(see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) that approach and/or intersect one another above the grip assembly <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described above. Those skilled in the art will recognize that many embodiments are possible within the scope of the invention. Other variations, modifications, and combinations of the various parts and assemblies can certainly be made and still fall within the scope of the invention. Thus, the invention is limited only by the following claims, and equivalents thereto. </paragraph>
