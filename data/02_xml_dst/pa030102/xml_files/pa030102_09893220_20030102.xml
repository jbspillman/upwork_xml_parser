<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to a multiple chamber semiconductor wafer processing system and, more specifically, the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for accessing a multiple chamber semiconductor wafer processing system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing systems that handle 200 mm wafers, the interface to the factory is a 25-wafer load-lock. The load-lock forms an entry and exit point for the IC manufacturing system. In use, a cassette carrying 25 wafers is placed into a load-lock and the air in the load-lock is removed to form a vacuum in the load-lock. The wafer cassette is vertically positioned in the load-lock to align a particular wafer with a wafer transport mechanism, e.g., a wafer transport robot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The time required to produce a vacuum in the load-lock is referred to herein as T<highlight><subscript>pump</subscript></highlight>. After processing within the IC manufacturing system, the processed wafer is returned to the cassette. When all the wafers have been processed and returned, the air in the load-lock is then let into the load-lock at a controlled rate in what is referred to as a vent operation. The time required to perform a vent operation is referred to herein as T<highlight><subscript>vent</subscript></highlight>. Once venting is complete, the cassette is removed from the load-lock. The maximum achievable load-lock throughput is represented as:

<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Load-locks are generally double-buffered by using a pair of parallel load-locks that feed wafers to a wafer processing system. As such, loading, pumping, venting, and unloading of one cassette is overlapped with processing of wafers from another cassette. Without double-buffering, no overlap is possible and the time required to pump and vent a load-lock can be almost as long as the wafer processing time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a semiconductor wafer processing system or cluster tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for 300 mm wafers comprising a plurality of process chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, and a transfer chamber <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>. The cluster tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is coupled to a factory interface <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The Fl <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> comprises a pair of single wafer load-locks (SWLLs) <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B, Fl transfer space <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> containing a wafer transport agent <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, and at least one load port (two are depicted as ports <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B). The Fl <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> may optionally comprise a wafer orientor, a pass-through slot, one or more cool down positions, a metrology station, or defect control station. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A tool transfer agent <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> (commonly referred to as a robot) accesses the chambers <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>and the load-locks <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B to move wafers amongst the chambers and load-locks. The SWLL <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B are used as the entry and exit points to the tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The load-locks <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B each retain only one wafer at a time during the pump/vent cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The Fl load ports <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B are supplied with wafer cassettes that hold up to 25 wafers each. When a transfer agent <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> having a single wafer transport blade is used in either the tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> or in the Fl <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, the SWLLs have two slots each. Using two slots enables a single blade robot (SBR) to wait for an SWLL to either pump or vent while being pre-positioned in front of the SWLL with a wafer on its blade. The robot then puts the wafer in an empty slot first before taking a wafer out of the SWLL. With two slots, the load and unload times are substantially decreased. However, the load-lock volume is increased to accommodate the second slot which increases pump and vent times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> When dual blade robots are used in both the tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the Fl <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, then only a single slot SWLL is used and load-lock volume is reduced. The second blade serves as a buffer that accepts a wafer from the SWLL before placing a new wafer from the other blade of the robot into the SWLL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Wafers from the Fl load ports <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A or <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B are directed toward either SWLL <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A or <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B depending upon which SWLL is available to be loaded. If both SWLLs are available, the wafer enters the nearest SWLL to the current position of the transfer agent <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Wafers leaving the transfer chamber <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are directed into either SWLL <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A or <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B depending upon which SWLL is available. If both SWLL are available, the wafer enters the one nearest the present position of the tool transfer agent <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The Fl <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> returns the wafer to the source cassette into its original position, i.e., preserving slot integrity. Wafers that enter the transfer chamber <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> through SWLL <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A are not restricted to exiting the transfer chamber <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> through SWLL <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A. Similarly, wafers from one cassette can enter either SWLL <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A or <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B depending on the load-lock availability. In other words, unless explicitly restricted by the system controller software, wafers from one cassette are not restricted from entering and leaving the tool via a particular load-lock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The fixed nature of the number of slots to either one or two can result in substantial transfer delays for wafers entering and leaving a cluster tool. Therefore, there is a need in the art for a method and apparatus to improve wafer throughput in semiconductor wafer processing systems that use load-locks. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a method and apparatus for transferring wafers to and from a semiconductor wafer processing cluster tool using a K-wafer load-lock (KWLL), where K is an integer that is greater than zero. Various methods are used to optimize the throughput of wafers through the KWLL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts a schematic representation of a KWLL <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> comprising K&plus;1 slots <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>through <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>K&plus;</subscript></highlight>1. Each slot <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> is intended to horizontally support and retain one wafer as the wafer is transferred from the factory interface (Fl) transfer agent <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> to the tool transfer agent <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. A pair of KWLLs <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are intended to replace both SWLL <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>B in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The KWLL <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> utilizes a variable number of K&plus;1 wafer slots assigned as inbound and outbound. Inbound slots are used to send up to K&plus;1 wafers into the cluster tool and the same physical slots, denoted as outbound, are used for receiving up to K&plus;1 wafers from the cluster tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The K&plus;1 slots are in the same volume that has to be pumped for wafers to go in and vented for wafers to go out of the tool. These K&plus;1 slots are supposed to accommodate up to K wafers when a single blade robots (tool&apos;s and Fl&apos;s transport agent) and up to K&plus;1 wafers when both the tool and Fl transfer spaces are equipped with dual blade robots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As shall be discussed below, using the KWLL <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, where 1&lt;K&lt;25, improves system throughput relative to using either an SWLL or a 25-wafer cassette-based load-lock. To facilitate increased throughput, the K-wafer load-lock pump and vent times may be matched to a given tool throughput, Fl process and load/unload time, and the number of wafers inside the tool. For example, it can be shown by simulation that for a wafer flow, </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>LoadPort&rarr;O&rarr;LL&rarr;(Etch, Etch, Etch)&rarr;LL&rarr;LoadPort </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> and using a 3-wafer slot load-lock (K&equals;2), offers an improvement in throughput of 22% over SWLL performance. In this simulation, it is assumed that the 3-slot load-lock has a volume that is double that of the SWLL and pump-vent times increase linearly with volume). In the above flow graph, O is an orient position in Fl having &ldquo;processing time&rdquo; of nine seconds, etch chambers have a processing time of 120 seconds each, and pump and vent time for the KWLL are assumed to be 30 seconds each. The scheduling algorithm used in both the tool and the Fl is reactive scheduling (as described below). As is described below, matching the scheduling algorithm, load-lock capacity, and its loading policy to the system&apos;s (Fl <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> plus tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>) configuration and parameters is the least expensive way to considerably improve the system&apos;s throughput. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In a system composed of a cluster tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, KWLL <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and Fl <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, both performance of each individual subsystem as well as their mutual interactions are important. Consider separately, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> using the KWLL of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the throughput bottleneck to be avoided must be the tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> because it is, by far, the most expensive component and should be utilized at all times, i.e., 100% utilization. That is, in no case are either the Fl or the KWLL to hinder the system&apos;s operation. KWLL <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be viewed as a &ldquo;gate&rdquo; large enough so that the cluster tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> never waits for another wafer from the Fl <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. If we denote by S<highlight><subscript>TOOL </subscript></highlight>and S<highlight><subscript>F </subscript></highlight>average throughputs of the cluster tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and its Fl <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, respectively, the S<highlight><subscript>TOOL</subscript></highlight>&lt;&lt;S<highlight><subscript>KWLL </subscript></highlight>and S<highlight><subscript>Fl</subscript></highlight>&lt;&lt;S<highlight><subscript>KWLL </subscript></highlight>and S<highlight><subscript>TOOL</subscript></highlight>&lt;S<highlight><subscript>Fl</subscript></highlight>&lt;S<highlight><subscript>KWLL</subscript></highlight>. In addition to throughput requirements, the system&apos;s dynamics must be such that the tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> never waits for wafers from the Fl <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. System dynamics are best indicated through the value of variance of pertinent steady-state variables. The variability of the system throughput is implied by the system configuration, slight randomness in the robot, the chamber, and the load-lock parameters, the execution of scheduling logic and the load-lock loading policy, and so on. </paragraph>

That is, if the tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has C<highlight><subscript>TOOL </subscript></highlight>wafers in it, additional unprocessed wafers need to wait either in the load-lock or in the Fl or in a cassette outside the system. It is the ratio of C<highlight><subscript>TOOL</subscript></highlight>/C<highlight><subscript>LLOCK </subscript></highlight>that determines the number of pump-vent cycles a load-lock needs to perform in order to fill-up the tool or to empty the tool of wafers belonging to a given product. There are two boundary effects of interest in wafer exchange from the Fl <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> into the tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and vice versa. One is when an empty tool starts filling up with wafers (up to C<highlight><subscript>TOOL </subscript></highlight>of them) in order to start processing. Another is when a tool is to be emptied of wafers that belong to a certain product; it takes approximately C<highlight><subscript>TOOL</subscript></highlight>/C<highlight><subscript>LLOCK </subscript></highlight>pumps and vents to empty the tool of wafers. A minimum number of pumps and vents to do this job can be found in order not to pump and vent empty load-locks more times than necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> There are two limiting cases here worth mentioning. In 200 mm wafer processing equipment, 25-wafer cassettes are placed into (usually dual-buffered) load-locks. Unprocessed wafers are taken from a cassette and, after visiting one or more process and/or metrology chambers, they are returned into the same position in the cassette they came from. Here, C<highlight><subscript>TOOL</subscript></highlight>/C<highlight><subscript>LLOCK </subscript></highlight>is always smaller than one (in many cases much smaller) so that there are no multiple pumps and vents in order to either fill-up or to empty the tool. The case is thus trivial. Put a cassette into a load-lock, wait until wafers are processed, and take the cassette out. Another limiting case is a single wafer load-lock (SWLL) deployed in 300 mm tools. Here C<highlight><subscript>TOOL</subscript></highlight>/C<highlight><subscript>LLOCK </subscript></highlight>&equals;C<highlight><subscript>TOOL </subscript></highlight>and thus C<highlight><subscript>TOOL </subscript></highlight>pumps/vents are needed in the transient period in order to fill/empty the tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Intuitively, there are two integers of interest here. First is a remainder, denoted by R and defined as </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>R:&equals;C<highlight><subscript>TOOL </subscript></highlight>mod C<highlight><subscript>LLOCK </subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> in the integer division of tool and load-lock capacities. The second integer of interest, denoted by D (stands for Divisor), is defined as, </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>D:&equals;C<highlight><subscript>TOOL </subscript></highlight>div C<highlight><subscript>LLOCK </subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> We are interested in cases when D&gt;0 and C<highlight><subscript>LLOCK</subscript></highlight>&gt;1. Note that D&plus;1 load-lock trips are needed before transient period is over. If R&equals;0, then D trips to the Fl robot space are needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Hence, the time to fill-up C<highlight><subscript>TOOL </subscript></highlight>chambers by using two single-wafer load-locks is given by </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>(<highlight><italic>D</italic></highlight>&plus;1)(<highlight><italic>T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>pump</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&plus;T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>vent</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&plus;T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>load</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>&plus;T</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>unload</subscript></highlight>)&equals;2(<highlight><italic>D</italic></highlight>&plus;1)/S<highlight><subscript>SWLL </subscript></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> where S<highlight><subscript>SWLL </subscript></highlight>is the throughput of single-wafer load-lock. When K-wafer load-lock is used, this time is given by </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>T<highlight><subscript>pump</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>(K)</superscript></highlight>&plus;T<highlight><subscript>vent</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>(K)</superscript></highlight>&plus;T<highlight><subscript>load</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>(K)</superscript></highlight>&plus;T<highlight><subscript>unload</subscript></highlight><highlight><superscript>(K)</superscript></highlight>. </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As already observed when comparing throughputs, the above sum for K-wafer load-lock can be considerably smaller than time needed to fill up the system of C<highlight><subscript>TOOL </subscript></highlight>chambers by using an SWLL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> There are two transient periods of interest here. First is when the tool is being loaded from empty to its steady-state. Second is when tool is being emptied from steady state. In either case, the logic (algorithms) used in bringing the wafers into the tool and removing them should satisfy the following set of constraints: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> 1. A load-lock should never return (i.e., from tool&apos;s robot space into the Fl robot space) with unprocessed wafers in it. The control logic should not be the cause of returning the unprocessed wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> 2. Minimize the number of times a load-lock either pumps or vents while empty. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> 3. Maximize the system throughput while satisfying the constraints on the length of stay of processed wafers in their respective chambers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Intuitively, the solution to this problem should depend on the type of wafer flow (i.e., serial, parallel, mixed, knotted), the number and type of chambers as well as on the number and type of robots. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In considering the solution satisfying the above criteria, essential to the solution is signaling (communication) between load-locks. For example, the system starts with an empty tool and loads K wafers into a first KWLL. The system signals that the system has C<highlight><subscript>TOOL</subscript></highlight>-K empty chambers to a second load-lock. The second KWLL is loaded with another K wafers and so on until the tool is filled with C<highlight><subscript>TOOL </subscript></highlight>wafers. The present invention uses a similar signaling between load-locks (i.e., handshaking) when the tool is being emptied as well as during the steady state operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts a method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> for transferring wafers in the Fl transfer space <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> using a single blade robot (SBR) as the transport agent. The method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> begins at step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> when a vent process is completed. At step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, the method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> queries whether there are any free slots in the KWLL. If the query is negatively answered, the method stops due to an error at step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>. Since this method operates using a single blade robot, the KWLL is supposed to only hold K wafers in K&plus;1 slots such that one slot is always available as a buffer. If no slots are available, an error is indicated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> If, at step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, the query is affirmatively answered, the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> where the method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> queries whether any processed wafers are in the KWLL. If the query is affirmatively answered, the method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> proceeds to step <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> where the method queries whether there are any unprocessed wafers in the Fl load port. If the query is affirmatively answered, the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> where the robot retrieves an unprocessed wafer from the Fl load port and is prepositioned in front of the KWLL. The robot then swaps the unprocessed wafer for a processed wafer and returns to step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. Steps <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight> are repeated until no processed wafers remain in the KWLL or no unprocessed wafers are available from the load port of the Fl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> If the query of either steps <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are negatively answered, the method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> proceeds to step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, the method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> queries whether all K&minus;1 slots are occupied by unprocessed wafers. If all K&minus;1 slots contain unprocessed wafers, the KWLL is deemed full and a pumping cycle is started at step <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>. If the query at step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> is negatively answered, the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> where the method queries whether any unprocessed wafers are in the Fl load port. If wafers remain in the load port, the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> to move an unprocessed wafer to the KWLL and then returns to step <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>. Steps <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight> fill any empty slots with wafers. If the query at step <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is negatively answered, then there are no more wafers available from the load port and the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> queries whether there are any unprocessed wafers in the KWLL. If the wafers are processed, or there are no wafers, the method stops at step <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>. If there are unprocessed wafers in the KWLL (although not all K&minus;1 slots are filled), the method proceeds from step <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> to step <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> to pump the KWLL to vacuum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The foregoing process ensures a controlled and efficient use of the KWLL to maximize throughput of wafers being transported from the Fl load port to the KWLL and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> depicts a flow diagram of a method <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> for controlling the movement of wafers into and out of a KWLL when the KWLL is either the source or the destination for the wafer. At step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight> the method queries whether the target chamber is the KWLL for a particular wafer. If the query, at step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, is negatively answered, the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight> wherein the method queries whether the KWLL is the source chamber for the wafer. If the query, at step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, is negatively answered, the method stops at step <highlight><bold>406</bold></highlight>. If the query, at step <highlight><bold>404</bold></highlight>, is affirmatively answered, then the method must decide whether the wafer that is leaving the KWLL is going to be sent to the Fl as the target space or the tool is the target space. As step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, the method queries whether the Fl is the target space for the wafer leaving the KWLL. If the query, at step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, is answered affirmatively, then the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> where the KWLL must be vented before the wafers can be moved from the KWLL to the Fl load port. At step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, the venting is finished and the wafers are loaded and unloaded. Additionally, in step <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, the processed wafer count is decremented by one for each wafer that is unloaded. At step <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight>, the vent is finished and the KWLL can be loaded from wafers within the load port of the Fl. As such, the KWLL will then be a target chamber for wafers coming from the Fl. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> If, at step <highlight><bold>408</bold></highlight>, the query is negatively answered, the method <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> proceeds to step <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>414</bold></highlight>, the method takes the unprocessed wafers from the load lock and places them in the tool and puts processed wafers into the load lock according to a scheduling algorithm for the tool. The method then decrements the unprocessed wafer count by one for each unprocessed wafer that is removed from the load lock. At step <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>, the method tests the unprocessed wafer count and the processed wafer count respectively to see if the KWLL is full of either processed or unprocessed wafers. If, at step <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, the method finds the wafer count of processed wafers equal to K&minus;1, the method deems the KWLL is filled with the processed wafers that are ready to be moved into the Fl load port. As such, the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> where the KWLL is vented. If, at step <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight>, the processed wafer count is not equal to K&minus;1, the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>418</bold></highlight>, the method queries whether there are more wafers in the tool. If there are not, the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and vents the KWLL.

<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> If, at step <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight>, the method finds the wafer count of unprocessed wafers is equal to K&minus;1, then the method deems the KWLL as being full of unprocessed wafers and ready to be pumped to vacuum such that the tool can access and remove the unprocessed wafers in step <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight>. If the unprocessed wafer count is not equal to K&minus;1, the method proceeds from step <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> to step <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> where the method queries whether there are unprocessed wafers in the Fl load port. If there are no wafers available in the load port, the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>432</bold></highlight> and pumps the KWLL to vacuum. However, if there are unprocessed wafers in the Fl load port at step <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, the query is answered affirmatively and the method <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> proceeds to step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> If, at step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, the KWLL is deemed the target chamber for the wafers, the query, at step <highlight><bold>402</bold></highlight>, is then answered affirmatively and the method <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> proceeds to step <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>, the method queries whether the Fl is the source space for the wafers that are being transferred to the KWLL. If the query, at step <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>, is answered affirmatively, the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>426</bold></highlight> where a wafer is placed from the Fl load port into the KWLL and the unprocessed wafer count is then incremented. The method <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> then proceeds to step <highlight><bold>428</bold></highlight> to determine when the unprocessed wafer count is equal to K&minus;1 and the KWLL is ready for pumping. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> If, at step <highlight><bold>424</bold></highlight>, the Fl is deemed not to be the source space, i.e., the wafers are coming from the tool.

The method then proceeds to step <highlight><bold>416</bold></highlight> to determine when the processed wafer count is equal to K&minus;1 such that the KWLL is deemed full and ready to be vented such that the wafers can be moved to the Fl load port. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> The foregoing method <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is used to efficiently move wafers from the Fl load port to the tool and from the tool to the Fl load port using the KWLL. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> For a given Fl and tool configuration and process and robot parameters, there are three additional variables that may affect the system throughput and cassette cycle time considerably. These are, </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> 1. Scheduling algorithms in the Fl and tool&apos;s robot space; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> 2. Load-lock capacity (maximum number of wafers that can be transported from one robot space to another); and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> 3. Load-lock loading policy (the rules and conditions under which pump and vent are initiated). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The above three variables interact in a complex manner and, for best system performance, a number of simulation experiments are needed before the load-lock capacity is decided and loading policy and scheduling algorithms are implemented. The &ldquo;wafer packing&rdquo; load-lock loading policy tries to maximize the number of wafers in the tool at any given point in time. Thus there is no waiting for processed wafers (in order for KWLL to go into vent) when there are wafers ready to be processed outside the tool. The term &ldquo;wafer packing&rdquo; is borrowed from a body of priority-based scheduling algorithm for cluster tools which have similar objective and behavior, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,928,389, issued Jul. 27, 1999 and 6,074,443, issued Jun. 13, 2000. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In general, the KWLL will be pumped if any of the following conditions hold true: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> 1. The load-lock is loaded with K unprocessed wafers (regardless of the conditions inside the tool); </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> 2. There are 0&lt;m&lt;K unprocessed wafers in the load-lock but no additional wafers in the Fl waiting to be moved into the tool; or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> 3. There are no unprocessed wafers in the load-lock, no wafers waiting to enter the load-lock, but there are wafers being processed in the tool that need to be moved into the Fl (i.e., empty the tool). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> And the KWLL will be vented if any of the following conditions hold true: </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is a flow diagram of the KWLL wafer-packing loading method <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> in steady state, i.e., after the KWLL has been filled with K wafers. At step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, the method <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> queries whether the KWLL is presently in the vacuum and is either empty or loaded with K processed wafers. This query is intended to test whether the KWLL is ready to leave the vacuum state and be vented. If the answer to the query, at step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, is negative, then the method <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> proceeds to step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> where the KWLL is deemed to be not in a vacuum. At step <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>, the KWLL waits for unprocessed wafers to be loaded into the KWLL and then the KWLL is pumped to vacuum. Once the vacuum is produced in the KWLL, the method <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> moves to step <highlight><bold>512</bold></highlight> wherein the unprocessed wafer are moved to the tool by the tools transport agent.

If there are no wafers waiting in the Fl, the method <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> proceeds to step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> where the KWLL is left in vacuum and awaits a call from the tool transfer agent to move processed wafers from the tool and into the KWLL. There is no reason why the KWLL should be vented because there are no wafers waiting to be moved into the tool from the Fl. After step <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>, the method <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> returns to step <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>.

<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> In a &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; loading method, the load-lock would wait for processed wafers to be loaded (from tool&apos;s robot space) in order to initiate a &ldquo;vent&rdquo; cycle. That is true, as long as there are wafers being processed by the cluster tool. As in the case with the wafer packing load method, the pump process is initiated to bring in new wafers (if there are any). If there are not any unprocessed wafers waiting in the Fl, the load-lock still may go into a pump cycle (this time empty) in order to remove processed wafers from the tool&apos;s robot space. In other words, the pump and vent cycles are initiated to &ldquo;react&rdquo; to the state of the tool and the Fl. </paragraph>

If the KWLL is not loaded with processed wafers, i.e., does not contain K wafers, the method <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> proceeds to step <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> where the KWLL waits for processed wafers to be loaded into the KWLL. After the processed wafers have been loaded into the KWLL, the method <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> returns to step <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. If, at step <highlight><bold>608</bold></highlight>, the KWLL is deemed to be loaded with processed wafers, the method proceeds to step <highlight><bold>612</bold></highlight> where the KWLL is vented. The method then proceeds to step <highlight><bold>614</bold></highlight> where the processed wafers are moved from the KWLL to the Fl. The method <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> then returns to step <highlight><bold>602</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> &ldquo;&ggr;-tolerant&rdquo; Load-lock Loading Policy </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In a &ldquo;wafer-packing&rdquo; loading method, the &ldquo;vent&rdquo; state is initiated whenever there are no unprocessed wafers in the KWLL. That is, KWLL begins a vent cycle either empty, partly loaded or fully loaded with processed wafers. If there are no wafers, the method will not wait. In the &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; loading method, the vent cycle is initiated only if the KWLL is filled with processed wafers (in steady state) or partially filled (when emptying the system). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> A Gamma-tolerant loading method establishes a threshold for waiting before initiating a vent cycle. This is best Illustrated on a single-wafer load-lock (SWLL) i.e., a KWLL with K&equals;1. Let T<highlight><subscript>travel</subscript></highlight>:&equals;T<highlight><subscript>vent</subscript></highlight>&plus;T<highlight><subscript>pump</subscript></highlight>&plus;T<highlight><subscript>load/unload </subscript></highlight>and let T<highlight><subscript>waiting </subscript></highlight>be the load-lock waiting time before a processed wafer is loaded (transferred from a chamber into the SWLL). Now if, T<highlight><subscript>travel</subscript></highlight>&lt;T<highlight><subscript>waiting</subscript></highlight>, a load-lock can be empty when a vent cycle begins, as well as bring a new (i.e., unprocessed) wafer from the Fl and still not be late to remove a processed wafer from of the tool. However, if T<highlight><subscript>travel</subscript></highlight>&gt;T<highlight><subscript>waiting</subscript></highlight>, it is not clear if an empty SWLL should initiate a vent cycle or not. The reason is that: 1) another load-lock may be available to remove the wafer, or 2) the difference &verbar;T<highlight><subscript>travel</subscript></highlight>&minus;T<highlight><subscript>waiting</subscript></highlight>&verbar; may be significant, or 3) even if the difference &verbar;T<highlight><subscript>travel</subscript></highlight>&minus;T<highlight><subscript>waiting</subscript></highlight>&verbar; is significant, the pending action (i.e., wait for a processed wafer or initiate a vent cycle with the SWLL empty) when executed would increase the throughput rather than adversely affecting the throughput. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> For a KWLL, the gamma tolerant loading method must take into consideration the number of wafers that can be loaded or unloaded from the KWLL during the waiting time T<highlight><subscript>waiting </subscript></highlight>and the number of wafers currently loaded in the KWLL. As such, if the travel time T<highlight><subscript>travel </subscript></highlight>is less than T<highlight><subscript>waiting </subscript></highlight>for one or more wafers, the KWLL can be used to load and unload wafers while awaiting a processed wafer to be ready for loading from the tool. Consequently, the travel time is now represented by T<highlight><subscript>travel</subscript></highlight>&equals;T<highlight><subscript>vent</subscript></highlight>&plus;T<highlight><subscript>pump</subscript></highlight>&plus;T<highlight><subscript>load/unload </subscript></highlight>(M), where M is the number of wafers that are to be loaded and unloaded into the KWLL during the period T<highlight><subscript>travel</subscript></highlight>. The number of wafers in the KWLL is represented as a wafer load level variable W<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>and must be greater than a threshold beta (&bgr;) to initiate a vent and pump cycle. &bgr; is set at a level that makes initiating the pump and vent cycle worth while. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> The idea behind a family of gamma-tolerant algorithms is to set a threshold value &ggr; (gamma) so that if the ratio T<highlight><subscript>waiting</subscript></highlight>/T<highlight><subscript>travel </subscript></highlight>is greater than &ggr; and the variable W<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>is greater than &ggr;, then load-lock should initiate a vent cycle, else it should wait for an additional wafer or wafers from the tool and then initiate a vent procedure. The value of gamma and beta is determined upon an exhaustive simulation of system throughput before being set in the cluster-tool control system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> depicts a flow diagram of a KWLL &ldquo;gamma-tolerant&rdquo; loading method <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight>. At step <highlight><bold>704</bold></highlight>, the method <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> initiates a pump cycle if any of the following conditions hold true at step <highlight><bold>702</bold></highlight>: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> 1. The load-lock is loaded with unprocessed wafers (regardless of the conditions inside the tool); or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> 2. There are no unprocessed wafers in the load-lock, no wafers waiting to be loaded into the load-lock, but there are wafers being processed in the tool that should be removed after being processed (i.e., empty the tool). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> and, at step <highlight><bold>708</bold></highlight>, the method <highlight><bold>700</bold></highlight> initiates a vent cycle if any of the following conditions hold true at step <highlight><bold>706</bold></highlight>: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> 1 T<highlight><subscript>waiting</subscript></highlight>/T<highlight><subscript>travel</subscript></highlight>&gt;&ggr;, W<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>&gt;&ggr; and there are unprocessed wafers in the Fl waiting to be loaded into the tool; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> 2. There are no unprocessed wafers in the Fl but the load-lock is completely filled with processed wafers waiting to be moved into the Fl robot space (i.e., emptying the tool); or </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> 3. There are no unprocessed wafers in the Fl, there are 0&lt;m&lt;K processed wafers in the load-lock, and no more wafers being processed in the tool (i.e., empty the tool). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Since tool configurations and parameters (e.g. number of chambers and chamber process time) tend to change as the process is altered to meet the needs of various products and device geometries, there is a need for being able to deploy various load-lock loading methods to match the configuration and scheduling algorithm for the highest throughput. Since the option should be possible in the same version of software, this is best accomplished by using a pull-down menu of various loading methods (e.g. reactive, wafer-packing, gamma-tolerant, and the like). Whenever there are changes in either system configuration or parameters or both, a throughput simulation program should be run and best loading policy for the given configuration and parameters should be established. That loading method should then be inserted into the tool&apos;s control system and software by &ldquo;point and click&rdquo;. Technically, the &ldquo;point and click&rdquo; insertion is accomplished by using a case statement, where each loading method is represented by a different case (the case is then chosen by passing an integer or a string from the user interface). For gamma-tolerant methods, once the policy is chosen as gamma-tolerant, the value of gamma is inserted from a separate field in the user interface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> While foregoing is directed to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow. </paragraph>
