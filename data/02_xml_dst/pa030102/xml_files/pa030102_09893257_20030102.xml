<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of hydraulic control systems for the swing drives of cranes, backhoes, power shovels, and related apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> For example, on a loader backhoe, there are a number of factors that reduce the performance of the swing system, including but not limited to air in the oil, inconsistent loads on the bucket, viscosity of the oil (temperature), and valve performance. These factors lead to control and performance issues such as backhoe oscillation, inconsistent stop control, and drift. Typically, swing control is accomplished by using an open circuit pump and a dedicated valve or sets of valves that are interposed between the pump and the hydraulic motors or hydraulic cylinders of the swing mechanism. Heretofore, such systems have proven to be complex in design and therefore expensive to manufacture. Thus, there is a need for swing control system that overcomes these deficiencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Thus, a primary objective of the present invention is the provision of an improved swing control system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A further objective of this invention is the provision of a swing control system that utilizes a closed circuit pump to directly control hydraulic cylinders for swing control, thereby eliminating the need for complex and costly intervening swing control valving. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A further objective of the present invention is to provide a simple, inexpensive, and improved swing control system for a loader backhoe or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A further objective of the present invention is a provision of a swing control system that is accurate, relatively insensitive to leakage, and reliable in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> These and other objectives will be apparent from the drawings as well as from the description and claims that follow. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a control system for the swinging of booms on backhoes, cranes, or similar material handling apparatus. This invention provides more direct control of the hydraulic swing cylinders and eliminates the need for additional complex valving and circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The control system of this invention is adapted for a material handling apparatus that includes a frame and a boom movably (usually pivotally or swingably) attached to the frame. A pair of double acting hydraulic cylinders on the frame connect in an opposing or inversely operating manner to the boom for swinging the boom with respect to the frame. The cylinders are hydraulically connected such that when fluid is supplied to one of the cylinders to extend its piston rod, that same fluid retracts the piston rod in the other cylinder, or vice-versa, to swing the boom with respect to the frame. The cylinders are directly controlled by a variable displacement hydraulic pump arranged in a closed circuit with the cylinders. The pump has a servo control associated therewith that is connected to a displacement varying means (such as a swashplate) disposed at least partially inside the pump, which establishes both the volume and direction of the flow of hydraulic fluid in the closed circuit. No separate swing control valve is required. The servo control on the pump is the sole means of controlling the cylinders.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the figures and the description that follows, like components are designated with like reference numerals. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> backhoe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> constitutes a material handling apparatus including a frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and an elongated boom <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> movably attached to the frame. Preferably the boom <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> pivotally or swingably attaches to the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> along a pivot axis or swing axis <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and secures for rotation with a swing bracket <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which in turn pivotally attaches to the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In order to understand the closed circuit swing control system of the present invention, it is first necessary to understand the conventional open circuit swing control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The conventional open circuit swing control system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, includes a uni-directional, variable displacement open circuit pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with a movable swashplate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The swashplate <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is connected to and controlled by a servo <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in a conventional manner to affect the fluid displacement of the pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a suction inlet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> fluidly connected to a reservoir <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The reservoir <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a relatively large capacity or volume for storing hydraulic fluid. This large volume is necessary because the circuit is open. The pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> must provide the whole circuit with pressurized fluid and the reservoir must be large enough to store that volume of fluid. The pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has an outlet or supply line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that is fluidly connected to a directional control valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which is also commonly referred to in the art as a swing control valve. An actuating means <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, such as a handle, solenoid, etc., is provided on the swing control <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Adjustable pressure compensating and pressure limiting valves <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, fluidly connect to the pump outlet or supply line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> as shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The swing control valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is a 3-position 4-way (port) valve, which is centered by springs <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to a central position wherein all of the ports <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are blocked. A drain line <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> fluidly connects port <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the reservoir <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Lines <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> fluidly connect a pair of hydraulic swing cylinders <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> respectively to the swing control valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Fluid enters the control valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> from the pump outlet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through a supply port <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The swing cylinders <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are double acting hydraulic cylinders whose construction is well known in the art and therefore will not be described in detail herein. However, suffice it to say that the swing cylinders <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> each include a piston and rod assembly slidably yet sealingly mounted in a cylindrical housing. The piston rod exits from the housing in a sealed fashion and the piston substantially seals against the interior wall of the housing to form two opposing pressurizable chambers, one hereinafter referred to as an upper chamber above the piston and another referred to hereinafter as a lower chamber around the rod. A hydraulic line <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> fluidly connects the port <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the swing control <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the upper chamber in cylinder <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. A hydraulic line <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> connects the lower chamber in cylinder <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> with the upper chamber in cylinder <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and thereby with line <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and port <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. A second hydraulic line <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> fluidly connects the lower chamber in cylinder <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> with the upper chamber in cylinder <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and thereby with line <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and port <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The piston rods of the cylinders <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are pivotally connected to the swing bracket <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> at points offset from the swing axis <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The other ends of the cylinders <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are pivotally connected to the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The conventional swing control system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> operates as follows. The pump <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> draws fluid from the reservoir <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, pressurizes it, and delivers it to the supply port <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the swing control valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through the supply line <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. If the valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is in the central position, no fluid is permitted to flow to or from the swing cylinders <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and the boom <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> generally maintains its present position. Internal leakage in the control valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> can cause the boom to drift from its intended position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> When the operator causes the actuating means <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to move the valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the top position in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, pressurized fluid can flow between the ports <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of the swing control valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Then the fluid flows through the upper chamber of cylinder <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> through line <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and into the lower chamber of cylinder <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> through line <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The fluid simultaneously forces the piston and rod assemblies of cylinders <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> to move inversely or in opposite directions. As a result, fluid is forced from the lower chamber of cylinder <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> into the upper chamber of cylinder <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, where it is likewise forced toward the port <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> through line <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The swing control valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> permits this fluid to return to the reservoir <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through the ports <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the drain line <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. The overall result of the swing control valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> being placed in the upper position is that the cylinder <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> extends and the cylinder <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> retracts, which swings the bracket <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the boom <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> attached thereto in a counter clockwise direction about the pivot axis <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. When the control <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is placed in the lower position, the fluid flows are reversed, as is the extension and retraction of the cylinders <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Thus, the bracket <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the boom <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> swing in a clockwise direction as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> By contrast, the closed circuit swing control system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The control system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a variable displacement closed circuit pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that is associated with the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the backhoe <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). More preferably, the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is mounted on the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and driven by the backhoe&apos;s engine (not shown). The fluid displacement or output of the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is determined by the angular position of a swashplate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The swashplate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is arranged so as to be permitted to go over center such that the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can displace more fluid in opposite directions within the closed circuit loop. A control servo <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> operatively connects with or preferably couples with the swashplate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> for controlling the angular position thereof. Thus, the control servo <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> controls the fluid displacement and output direction of the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> through closed circuit loop that includes system pressure lines <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> A fixed displacement charge pump <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is associated with the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and is connected with conventional circuitry (not shown) to make up any fluid losses that occur in the closed circuit hydraulic loop by drawing fluid from a relatively small reservoir <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The reservoir <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> in the closed circuit swing control system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) is considerably smaller than the reservoir <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) required in the open circuit swing control system. The reservoir <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> merely has to be large enough to hold make-up fluid for the closed circuit loop, and does not have to hold all of the fluid that usually resides in the closed circuit loop. A charge relief valve <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> is included downstream of the charge pump <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. The pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> has a case drain line <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> which routes the internal fluid leakage experience by the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to a case drain <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, as is conventional. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The system pressure lines <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> fluidly connect the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> directly to the hydraulic swing cylinders <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Thus the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, system pressure lines <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and the swing cylinders <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are arranged in a closed circuit hydraulic loop. System pressure line <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> directly connects the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to the swing cylinder <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. System pressure line <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> directly connects the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to the swing cylinder <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Again, lines <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> interconnect the cylinders so that their piston rods move inversely with respect to each other. The need for any intervening swing control valves like valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is avoided. The control servo <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is effectively the sole valve or means for controlling the cylinders <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In operation, the closed circuit swing control system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the present invention operates as follows. If the operator wants to swing the boom <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in a clockwise direction, the operator actuates the control servo <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> so as to move the swashplate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to an angular position that causes the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to displace a proportional volume of hydraulic fluid through the system pressure line <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to the swing cylinder <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The piston rod of the swing cylinder <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> extends proportionally and the swing cylinder <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> retracts inversely such that the swing bracket <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the boom <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> attached thereto swing in a clockwise direction. As another result of the movement of the piston rods of the cylinders <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, hydraulic fluid is forced from cylinder <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> through the system pressure line <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and returned to the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> If the operator wants the boom <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to swing in the opposite direction, the operator actuates the control servo <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> to move the swashplate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> to an angular position on the other side of its neutral or no-flow position. The pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> then displaces fluid in a counter-clockwise direction within the closed circuit loop. The pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> supplies pressurized fluid through system pressure line <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to the swing cylinder <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, causing its piston rod to extend and the piston rod of the cylinder <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to retract. The swing bracket <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the boom <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are thereby swung in a counter-clockwise direction. Hydraulic fluid forced out of the swing cylinders <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> returns to the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> through the system pressure line <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the swing cylinders <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are identical or at least equal in their functional operating parameters (effective volumes, piston areas, etc.). Therefore, the system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> does not require any special valves to adjust for any differential cylinder volume. The bi-directional system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> also eliminates the need for an intervening directional valve and provides direct control of the movement of the swing cylinders <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> by using the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that delivers energy to the system. System complexity is greatly reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Many of the control and performance problems in the open circuit swing control system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are linked to the swing control valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and its design. Because the closed circuit swing control system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> utilizes a closed circuit pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, the oil demand on the reservoir <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is limited to the case drain flow from the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. This is much less than the flow required with the conventional open circuit swing control system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The lower oil demand on the reservoir means that less air will be introduced into the system. Air typically causes adverse effects on the control of the system and system performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> As with any valve, the swing control valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has some inherent internal leakage. Because the swing control valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is not needed in the closed circuit swing control system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of the present invention, the leakage, and therefore the drift, is greatly reduced. Overall system responsiveness and hysteresis is improved by moving control of the system from the valve <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to the pump control servo <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The swinging of the boom <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is proportional to the fluid displacement of the pump <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> and the acceleration of the boom <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is proportional to the acceleration of the swashplate <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> caused by the stroking of the control servo <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The circuit of the present invention is less complex and therefore less costly to manufacture. Since there are fewer components which can fail, the closed control system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is more reliable than the open circuit system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The closed circuit swing control system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of this invention is also easier to install because it has fewer hydraulic connections. Fewer hydraulic connections also means that the circuit is less prone to leakage because each of the connections represents a possible point of leakage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Thus it can be seen that the present invention at least satisfies its stated objectives. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In the drawings and specification there has been set forth a preferred embodiment of the invention, and although specific terms are employed, these are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation. Changes in the form and the proportion of parts as well as in the substitution of the equivalents are contemplated as circumstances may suggest or render expedient without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. </paragraph>
