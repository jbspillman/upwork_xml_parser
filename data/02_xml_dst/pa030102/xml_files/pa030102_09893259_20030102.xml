<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to safety labels for fuel cans for heating chafing dishes, such as gel chafing fuel cans, e.g. Sterno&reg; type cans. More specifically, the present invention relates to labels for Sterno&reg; type chafing fuel cans that indicate the physical characteristics of the cans as they relate to temperature. The safety label provides information to the end user about the characteristics of the chafing fuel can through the use of a thermochromic ink that undergoes a sharp, reversible visible metachromism in response to a particular temperature change. The present invention also relates to a method of manufacturing labels for chafing fuel cans which utilize thermochromic inks to provide visual information about the physical characteristics of the as they relate to temperature. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Sterno&reg; type and other similar chafing fuel cans are well known. These can heating elements typically are used for the heating of food inside of chafing dishes. Such chafing fuel cans are typically aluminum cans that are approximately two to three inches in height and have a retractable or removable lid. When the lid is removed, an ethanol fuel, a gel fuel, or other fuel disposed therein is exposed. This fuel, when ignited, provides an invisible flame (such as those associated with burning ethanol) that is capable of reaching temperatures of up to 500&deg; F. (260&deg;&deg;C.). Chafing fuel cans of this type are popular with consumers because of their ability to continuously heat food products in chafing dishes, coffee carafes, or other containers over extended periods of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One problem with such chafing fuel cans of this type is that they may be associated with burn injuries. Such injuries are sometimes caused because the invisible nature of the fuel. Users are often unable to determine whether or not the fuel is actually burning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Moreover, burn injuries may also occur after the flame of the heating element is extinguished. For example, several minutes after the flame is extinguished, the surface temperature of such chafing fuel cans often remain elevated to the point where skin burns can still occur. Users who are unaware that the flame was recently extinguished, may handle the can prematurely and thereby burn themselves. Furthermore, burn injuries associated with chafing fuel cans may also occur because the user is unaware of the level of the fuel inside of the can. The fuel disposed in such chafing fuel cans burns extremely hot at and above the surface level of the fuel in the can. However, just below the surface level of the fuel, the temperature of the chafing fuel can is low enough for the user to safely handle the can&apos;s exterior. Therefore, if the user is unaware of the level of the surface of the fuel within the chafing fuel can, accidental burn injuries may occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Another problem associated with the such chafing fuel cans is that there is currently no visual representation of the temperature at which the chafing can burns. The United States Food and Drug Administration requires that hot food be kept at or above 140&deg; F. in open air chafing dishes in order to be in the heated &ldquo;safe zone.&rdquo; When chafing dish food is kept above this temperature, a substantial amount of harmful bacteria is killed. Therefore, it would be advantageous to know whether or not the chafing fuel can is burning at or above 140&deg; F. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Due to the inherent dangers associated with any such lighted chafing fuel cans, it would be desirous to design a safety label for such cans that is capable of providing information to the user about the temperature characteristics of the chafing fuel can. Such a safety label would prevent many burn injuries associated with such cans. Currently, no safety labels for Sterno&reg; and other type chafing fuel cans are available that are capable of providing this type of information to the user. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The invention satisfies the needs noted here by providing a safety label that is capable of visibly providing users of Sterno&reg; and other type chafing fuel cans with a variety of information about the current physical characteristics of the cans as they relate to temperature. Thus, safety labels made in accordance with the invention will work to prevent burn injuries associated with chafing fuel cans by providing a visual indication of the actual elevated temperatures present with the cans. The visual indication on the present safety label is achieved through the use of a media such as an ink or paint with thermochromic materials dispersed therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thermochromic materials that undergo sharp, reversible visual metachromism in response to temperature changes are known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,028,118 issued to Nakasuji et al. discloses such a material. Typically, these materials contain, as indispensable components, an electron-donating, chromatic organic compound, a compound having a phenolic hydroxyl group, and a compound selected from the group consisting of higher aliphatic monatomic alcohols and higher aliphatic monatomic acid alcohol esters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with a fundamental aspect of this invention, there is provided a safety label for use with Sterno&reg; and other type chafing fuel cans. The safety label contains at least one portion that includes media with thermochromic material dispersed therein. The media with thermochromic materials is capable of reversibly undergoing visible metachromism as it is exposed to increased temperatures, and returning to its original color as the temperature decreases, thereby permitting use as a safety indication of increased temperatures.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Accordingly the invention satisfies the needs noted above by providing a safety label for Sterno&reg; and other type chafing fuel cans that is capable of visually providing information to the user about the physical characteristics of the chafing can. Therefore, labels made in accordance to this invention may be marketed to consumers as &ldquo;safety&rdquo; labels due to the fact that they can work to prevent serious burn injuries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The safety indicating features of the chafing fuel can labels are provided through thermochromic materials disposed in a media such as printing inks or paints. Such materials are capable of exhibiting a sharp and reversible visual metachromism at temperatures within a range of &minus;40&deg; F.(&minus;40&deg; C.) and 500&deg; F. (260&deg; C.). For example, a preferred range is 120&deg; F. (49&deg; C.) to 130&deg; F. (54&deg; C.). The thermochromic material is formed form (A) an electron-donating, chromatic organic compound; (B) a compound containing a phenolic hydroxyl group; (C) a compound selected from the group consisting of higher aliphatic monovalent acid alcohol esters. This basic thermochromic material is then microencapsulated and dissolved or dispersed in printing ink or other media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>, the method of producing safety labels <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for chafing fuel cans includes applying informational indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> such as words or symbols on the label substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> using a non-thermochromic material <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. These indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be an indication of warning or they may provide information. The indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are then covered by a media with thermochromic materials <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> dispersed therein. Preferably the media with the thermochromic material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is of opaque color as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>show the safety label <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in operation on a chafing fuel can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. According to its intended use, the safety label <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is placed on a chafing fuel can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Typically, the can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> contains gelled ethanol or some other type of fuel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. When the fuel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is ignited with a match <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or other flame means for ignition, the fuel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> burns with invisible flames <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. As the fuel <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> burns, the heat from the chafing fuel can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can reach temperatures of up to 500&deg; F. (260&deg; C.). As these temperatures are approached, the thermochromic materials <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> dispersed throughout the media undergo a sharp reversible visual metachromism thereby rendering the media invisible and simultaneously revealing the underlying words of warning <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that were previously covered by the media with the thermochromic material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. This, in turn, provides a visual indication of the elevated temperature of the chafing fuel can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As shown in the different embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f, </italic></highlight>the informational indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that are chosen can be placed on the label <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a variety of different locations. Moreover, these indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can provide various types of safety and other information to the user of the chafing fuel can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> indicating that it is time to replace the can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> because the fuel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has been consumed can be placed on the label <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> vertically using media with non-thermochromic material <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The informational indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are then covered by media with thermochromic materials <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> disposed therein, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>. In this embodiment, the safety label <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will indicate the level of the fuel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. When the fuel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is ignited, the thermochromic materials <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> within the media will undergo the visual metachromism at and above the level of the fuel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> thereby indicating where a user can safely handle the exterior of the chafing fuel can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Moreover, as the fuel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is consumed, the user will know when to replace the chafing fuel can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with a fresh one. Additionally, as a further modification to this embodiment as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, another or second thermochromic material <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may be used on the label <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to cover the informational indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. (Although depicted for visual clarity in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>f </italic></highlight>as a different color from the thermochromic material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, preferably, the second thermochromic material <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> should be of the same color of the first thermochromic material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>.) The second thermochromic material <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> may be selected such that it undergoes reversible metachromism at a temperature that is different than that of the first thermochromic material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. In this manner, different portions of the label <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will undergo metachromism at different temperatures, thereby revealing the informational indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at different times as necessary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> For example, at 49&deg; C. the first thermochromic material could reveal the warning message &ldquo;HOT&excl; CAUTION&excl;&rdquo; After one hour into the burn cycle, the temperature may reach 182&deg;&deg;C. At that point, the second thermochromic material could reveal the message &ldquo;EXTREMELY HOT&excl;&rdquo;. Moreover, if desired, a third or even a fourth thermochromic material may be utilized on the label. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In yet a further embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, the location of the informational indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the safety label <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will work to provide specific current temperature information at which the chafing fuel can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> then burns. When heating food in chafing dishes and other heated containers, it is important to make sure that the food maintains a temperature of at least 140&deg; F. When foods are kept at this temperature, the United States Food and Drug Association indicates that the food is within a heated &ldquo;safe zone&rdquo; for consumption. Therefore, the informational indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>which span horizontally across the top of the safety label <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will indicate to a user of the chafing fuel can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> that the foods being warmed in the associated chafing dish (not shown) are being held at a safe temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In yet another embodiment, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, a safety label <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> according to the invention is produced by applying the informational indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the label substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> using a media with a thermochromic material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> disposed therein. The next step is to apply a non-thermochromic media to the label substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The non-thermochromic media is applied to the label substrate <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in such a way that it abuts the outline <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the informational indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> but does not cover it. Preferably, the media containing the thermochromic material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the non-thermochromic media <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are substantially the same color. Therefore, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, when the safety label <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is exposed to increased temperature, the informational indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> applied with the thermochromic material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> undergoes a visible metachromism rendering them invisible. When this happens, the outline <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the informational indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> where the media with the thermochromic material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> abuts the non-thermochromic media is visible. In this manner, the information about the chafing fuel can is visually conveyed to the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In still a further embodiment, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the informational indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are applied directly to the surface of the chafing fuel can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the informational indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is covered up with media <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that includes a thermochromic material dispersed therein. When the fuel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is ignited by a match <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or similar flame source, an invisible flame <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> raises the temperature of the chafing fuel can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. As the temperature of the chafing fuel can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is raised, the media with the thermochromic material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> disposed therein undergoes a visible metachromism thereby revealing the informational indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Additionally, an obvious variation of the invention, (not shown), would be to combine the embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight>In this embodiment, the informational indicia <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> would be applied directly to the chafing fuel can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> using a media with a thermochromic material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> disposed therein. The next step would be to apply a non-thermochromic media <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> directly to the chafing fuel can <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> such that the non-thermochromic media <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> abuts the outline <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the media with the thermochromic material <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. </paragraph>
