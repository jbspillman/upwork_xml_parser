<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a method of processing a semiconductor device having topographical features therein. More specifically, the process of the present invention is directed to providing means for electrical interconnection capability to a semiconductor device without introducing debris into topographical features resulting from such processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The continuing decrease in size of semiconductor devices, which include semiconductor wafers, semiconductor chips, ceramic substrates, patterned film structures and the like, have resulted in increased failure rates due to shorts and other defects in the electrical pattern disposed upon the semiconductor device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> As indicated above, it is the ever increasing miniaturization of semiconductor devices that has created these problems. Specifically, a major cause of increased electrical failures has been the inability to remove debris from topographical features due to the inability of traditional solvents from penetrating therein to remove debris that disturbs the resulting electrical conductivity on and between semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The preparation of electrical interconnection of a semiconductor device requires that an electrically conductive layer be disposed in topographical features of the semiconductor device so that electrical conductivity paths can be later introduced thereon. However, as those skilled in the art are aware, the electrically conductive layer must be removed from those portions of the semiconductor device, principally the surface, where no electrical conductivity is desired. This is accomplished by chemical mechanical polishing. However, this polishing step oftentimes results in the deposition of debris into the typographical surfaces. Indeed, a discussion of this problem is set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 6,126,853. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the prior art, the removal of unwanted conductive material after formation of seed layers and other such materials by chemical mechanical processing, which resulted in the deposition of debris into topographical features, was accomplished by utilizing wet chemical cleaning processes of the type set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5,972,124. Unfortunately, as semiconductor devices have become smaller and smaller, even reaching the nanometer size, the ability of conventional cleaning solvents to penetrate into such topographical features has markedly diminished. As such, prior art processes are incapable of providing satisfactory processing of the most recently developed semiconductor devices to provide those devices with electrical interconnection capability. There is therefore a strong need in the art for a new process of providing electrical interconnection of semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> A new process has now been developed which permits electrical interconnection of semiconductor devices even when the semiconductor devices themselves are of such small size and possessed of such high aspect ratios that conventional cleaning materials cannot penetrate into topographical features thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention a process of providing a semiconductor device, having topographical features with electrical interconnection capability, is provided. In this process an electrically conductive seed layer is deposited thereon. This is followed by the deposition of a layer of a sacrificial material which is soluble in liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide. The semiconductor device is thereupon polished with a chemical mechanical polish to remove the unwanted seed layer material and the sacrificial material from all but the topographical features of the semiconductor device. The sacrificial material is then removed from the topographical features of the semiconductor device by contacting the device with liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor devices, which include semiconductor wafers, semiconductor chips, ceramic substrates, patterned film structures and the like, are provided with topographical features in order to provide electrical conductivity in and among such devices. The topographical features are employed to provide conduits into which electrically conductive materials, usually metals, can be disposed to provide electrical conductivity. Those skilled in the art are aware that metal or other electrically conductive seed layers provide an excellent foundation upon which an electrically conductive metal may be plated or otherwise introduced. Indeed, the recent growth in importance of electroless plating, which results in the deposition of metals into topographical features such as vias, trenches, indentations and the like is evidence of this observation. The subsequent removal of deposited material from planar and other surfaces, upon which electrical conductivity is undesired, however, has been the source, in the prior art, of problems insofar as their removal has led to debris falling into topographical features causing electrical failures of the semiconductor device. The process of the present invention overcomes this serious defect in prior art processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The process of the present invention is best understood by reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 5</cross-reference>. In these figures a semiconductor device, designated by reference numeral <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, is provided. The device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which is constructed of a semiconductor material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, e.g. silicon, is provided with a topographical feature. That is, the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> includes a trench <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In a first step the semiconductor material <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is coated with a seed layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of an electrically conductive material, usually a metal. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the seed layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, whose purpose is to cover topographical features, not only forms a layer on topographical features of device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, e.g. trench <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, but, in addition, covers non-topographical portions, such as surface <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, of device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. It is the removal of seed layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> from non-topographical features that requires that this layer be subjected to chemical mechanical polishing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In order to overcome problems associated in the prior art with debris falling into trench <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> during chemical mechanical polishing, in which surface <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is planarized, the next step in the process of the present invention is filling topographical features with a sacrificial material <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Sacrificial material <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is limited by the requirement that it be soluble in liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide. In a preferred embodiment the sacrificial material <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is insoluble in aqueous media. More preferably, the sacrificial material <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is a perfluoroacrylate, a paraffin wax, nylon, polybutene, polydimethylsiloxane, copolymers of dimethyl siloxane and methyl methacrylate and mixtures thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> upon completion of the deposition of the sacrificial material <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. The device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is thereupon planarized to remove the seed layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> disposed upon surface <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This is accomplished by standard chemical mechanical polish processing, the method of which is well known in the art. In the course of this planarizing step the sacrificial material <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, disposed on surface <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, is also removed. However, in addition to the desirable retention of the seed layer in trench <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the sacrificial material <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> also remains therein, as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Although it is the retention of sacrificial material <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> in trench <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that ensures that no debris, which is produced in the planarizing step, can deposit therein, the sacrificial material must be removed without disturbing the seed layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Thus, in a subsequent step, the sacrificial material <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is removed by contact with liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide. The result of this step is depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with a seed layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> disposed in trench <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, free of any debris. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In an optional final step of the process of the present invention, electrical conductivity in the semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is provided by disposing, such as by plating, an electrical conductive material, preferably an electrically conductive metal, of which copper is preferred, in the topographical features in which the electrically conductive seed layer <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is disposed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The step of contacting semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide requires an apparatus that permits retention of the carbon dioxide in the liquid or supercritical state during contact of the device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> with liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide. Such a suitable apparatus is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The apparatus includes a process chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> which includes a sacrificial material removal zone <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> wherein a semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is disposed. The process chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is surrounded by heated jacket <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and contains, optionally, a stirring mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Additionally, the chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contains inlet line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, outduct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and thermocouple <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The inlet line <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> contains a high pressure pump system <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which is connected to a carbon dioxide source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for supplying liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide to process chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Thermocouple <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is also connected to heat controller <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which controls and monitors the temperature of the sacrificial material removal zone <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A reservoir <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may also be provided for collecting and purifying liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide that may exit process chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through outduct <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. This carbon dioxide may then be recycled into process chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through duct <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> to form a closed system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The carbon dioxide source <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> contains pressurized carbon dioxide. Indeed, as stated above, and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the carbon dioxide is further pressurized by high pressure pump <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Typically, the liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide is prepressurized to a pressure in the range of between about 1,000 psi and about 6,000 psi. More preferably, the carbon dioxide is prepressurized to a pressure in the range of between about 2,000 psi and about 5,000 psi. Even more preferably, the carbon dioxide is pressurized to a pressure of about 3,000 psi before entering process chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> through inlet conduit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The processing step of sacrificial material removal is conducted in accordance with the thermodynamic conditions extant in processing chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The pressure in processing chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is in the range of between about 1,000 psi and about 6,000 psi, more preferably, a pressure of between about 2,000 psi and about 5,000 psi and, most preferably, a pressure of about 3,000 psi. The temperature in processing chamber <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is in the range of between about 40&deg; C. and about 100&deg; C., more preferably, a temperature in the range of between about 40&deg; C. and about 70&deg; C. and, most preferably, a temperature of about 40&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> To ensure effective removal of the sacrificial material from semiconductor device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the device is exposed to the aforementioned thermodynamic conditions for between about 2 minutes and about 2 hours. More preferably, the time period of exposure of device <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide, under the above-identified conditions, is about 3 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Another optional feature of the sacrificial material removal step, which helps ensure uniform exposure to the carbon dioxide fluid, is providing stirring of the liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide. This is depicted in the apparatus, where stirring is provided, by stirring mechanism <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In those cases where this optional feature is provided, stirring occurs at a rate of between about 500 rpm and about 2,500 rpm. Preferably, stirring occurs at a rate of about 1,000 rpm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The above embodiments are given to illustrate the scope and spirit of the present invention. These embodiments will make apparent, to those skilled in the art, other embodiments and examples. These other embodiment and examples are within the contemplation of the present invention. Therefore the present invention should be limited only by the appended claims. </paragraph>
