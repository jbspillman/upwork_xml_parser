The system includes one or more light sources, each light source directing light to one or more features and/or gratings on a wafer.

<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to semiconductor processing, and in particular to a system and method for developing a real time etch image employing scatterometry analysis. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the semiconductor industry, there is a continuing trend toward higher device densities. To achieve these high densities there have been, and continue to be, efforts toward scaling down device dimensions (e.g., at sub-micron levels) on semiconductor wafers. In order to accomplish such high device packing densities, smaller and smaller feature sizes are required. This may include the width and spacing of interconnecting lines, spacing and diameter of contact holes, and the surface geometry, such as corners and edges, of various features. The dimensions of and between such small features can be referred to as critical dimensions (CDs). Reducing CDs, and reproducing more accurate CDs facilitates achieving higher device densities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The process of manufacturing semiconductors, or integrated circuits (commonly called ICs, or chips), typically consists of more than a hundred steps, during which hundreds of copies of an integrated circuit may be formed on a single wafer. Each step can affect the CDs of the ICs. Generally, the manufacturing process involves creating several patterned layers on and into the substrate that ultimately forms the complete integrated circuit. This layering process creates electrically active regions in and on the semiconductor wafer surface. One of the steps employed in manufacturing a semiconductor is an etch step, where selected portions of a layer (e.g., unprotected oxide layer) are removed from a wafer. Such an etch step may comprise a multi-step process that may be performed many times during the fabrication of a semiconductor. Thus, the size, shape and isolation of the electrically active regions, and thus the reliability and performance of integrated circuits employing such regions depend, at least in part, on the precision with which etching can be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Developing a precise etching process, where parameters including, but not limited to, chemical formulae, heat, time, pressure, light angles, and the like, are varied, can be a tedious, time and resource consuming undertaking, that may, ultimately, produce a process in which there is an incomplete understanding of the cause and effect relationships between certain etching process results and certain etching process parameters. Such uncertainty may arise due to the conventional method for characterizing an etch process. Conventionally, an etch process is characterized after the process is complete. Such characterization may include breaking open a wafer after it has been etched and examining results like profile, CDs, depths of trenches, height of features and so on. Based on the post etch examination, one or more etch parameters (e.g., chemical formulae, heat, time, pressure, light angles) may be adjusted, and the etch/break/examine cycle repeated until an acceptable etch result is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Unfortunately, these types of end-point detection methods can be problematic for several reasons. For example, the effect of changing an etch parameter may not be discovered until the etch/break/examine cycle has been repeated numerous times. Furthermore, understanding the effect of changing etch parameters may require such parameters to be changed substantially in isolation, which can lengthen the etch process characterization procedure. In addition, post-fabrication detection/quality control data do not provide a user with real-time information related to the device being fabricated. Post-fabrication data may only allow an estimation or a projection as to what adjustments are needed to correct the fabrication errors and/or flaws. Such estimations and/or projections concerning necessary adjustments may lead to continued or recurring fabrication errors. Moreover, such a lengthy adjustment process may cause subsequent fabricated wafers to be wasted in the hopes of mitigating etch process errors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Visual inspection methods employed in characterizing etch trim processes have been important in both production and development of integrated circuits. Visually inspecting etched wafers is well-known in the art. While visual inspection techniques may be simple to implement, they are difficult to automate. Further, visual techniques employing scanning electron microscopes (SEM) and atomic force microscopes (AFM) can be expensive, time-consuming and/or destructive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Due to the extremely fine patterns that are exposed on the photo resist, controlling the etching process, whereby oxide and/or other conductive or insulating layers are removed, is a significant factor in achieving desired critical dimensions. Achieving greater precision in etch processes can result, for example, in achieving more precise CDs (e.g., desired lengths and widths between layers, between features and within features). Thus, an efficient system, and/or method, to more quickly and more accurately characterize etch processes is desired to facilitate manufacturing ICs exhibiting desired critical dimensions. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a system that facilitates characterizing an etching process involved in semiconductor manufacturing. An exemplary system can employ one or more light sources arranged to project light onto one or more features and/or gratings on a wafer, and one or more light sensing devices (e.g., photo detector, photodiode) for detecting light reflected and/or refracted by the one or more features and/or gratings as the features and/or gratings are being etched. Thus, the effects of changing one or more etch parameters (e.g., chemical formulae, heat, time, pressure, light angles) can be studied in-situ, with a resulting increase in the understanding of the cause/effect relationship between changing an etch parameter and the resulting etched wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A grating is usually divided into a large number of sufficiently thin planar grating slabs to approximate an arbitrary profile. During etching, the light reflected from the one or more features and/or gratings is indicative of at least one parameter of etching processes (e.g., percent completion of etching) that can be measured to determine whether desired profiles, depths, critical dimensions (CDs), and so on are being achieved and to determine whether adaptations to the etching process being characterized should be undertaken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> One or more etching components can be arranged to correspond to a particular wafer portion. Alternatively, one or more etching components can be employed to etch various wafer portions. The etching components may be, for example, a gas plasma apparatus employed in reactive ion etching. It is to be appreciated that any suitable etching components may be employed with the present invention. For example, components including, but not limited to those employed in performing a main etch, a trim etch (e.g., etch step before main etch (e.g., descum etch), a PR trim and/or a BARC (breakthrough anti-reflective coating) etch) may be employed in accordance with the present invention. The etching components are selectively driven by the system to etch away oxide and/or other materials (e.g., in a polysilicon) at a desired location, at a desired rate, to a desired depth and/or to a desired width. The etching process is monitored by the system by comparing the etch results (e.g., CDs (space between features and/or gratings), depth, height, profiles) on the features and/or gratings on the wafer to desired results. Data gathered during such monitoring can be employed to gain an understanding of the results of changing one or more etch parameters (e.g., chemical formulae, heat, time, pressure, light angles). Similarly, data gathered during such monitoring can be analyzed to determine whether further adaptations to the etch process are desired. As a result, more optimal etching process characterization is achieved which can reduce the time and expense of producing an etch process that can subsequently be employed to produce high quality integrated circuits. Additionally, and/or alternatively, data concerning etch process conditions that resulted in favorable and/or unfavorable CDs can be stored to facilitate reproducing favorable etch process conditions for subsequent portions of the wafer being etched and/or for subsequent wafers. In one example of the present invention, the data that is gathered is analyzed using machine learning techniques to facilitate more quickly and more accurately adapting the etch process being characterized and to facilitate more quickly and more accurately adapting subsequent etch processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> One aspect of the present invention provides a system for characterizing an etch process. The system includes an etching component that can etch at least one portion of a wafer and an etch component driving system for driving the etching component. The system includes a grating fabricating component operable to fabricate gratings on the wafer and a system for directing light toward gratings located on the wafer. The system further includes an etch monitoring system operable to measure etching results from light reflected from the gratings and a processor operatively coupled to the etch monitoring system and the etch component driving system. The processor receives etching result data from the measuring system and analyzes the etching result data by comparing the measured etching result data to stored etching result data to produce a real-time image of the etching results and, in one example of the present invention, to compute suggested adaptations to the etch process being characterized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for characterizing an etch process. The method includes logically partitioning a wafer into one or more portions. The method then establishes one or more gratings to be etched on the wafer, etches the wafer, and directs an incident light onto the gratings and collects light reflected from the grating. The reflected light is measured to determine one or more etching results associated with the grating (e.g., CDs, depth, profile). The method includes computing suggested adjustments for etching components by comparing scatterometry signatures associated with the measured etching results to scatterometry signatures associated with stored etching results and employing the signatures to compute the adjustments to the etch process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects of the invention are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed and the present invention is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and novel features of the invention may become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings.</paragraph>

Thus, non-linear training systems/methodologies (e.g., back propagation, Bayesian, fuzzy sets, non-linear regression, or other neural networking paradigms including mixture of experts, cerebella model arithmetic computer (CMACS), radial basis functions, directed search networks and function link networks) may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for characterizing an etch process is illustrated. Such etch processes may be employed, for example, to remove hardened photoresist. While the illustrations associated with this application primarily depict etching occurring directly under one or more etch components, it is to be appreciated that directional etches may also be characterized by the present invention. In plasma etching systems, specific gases are fed into the reaction chamber. There, the plasma creates reactive species from those gases. The etch rate is generally proportional to the concentration of the reactive species. Thus, conventional techniques may employ indirect measurements, including analyzing the reacted gases, to determine etching progress. But such techniques do not provide direct information concerning etch results (e.g., CDs, depths, profiles) being achieved on a wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> operative to direct a light <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> at a wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> that is going to be etched or that is in the process of being etched. The etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be a standalone device and/or can also be distributed between two or more cooperating devices and/or processes. The etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can reside in one physical or logical device (e.g., computer, process) and/or be distributed between two or more physical or logical devices. The etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may include one or more components that are located inside a process chamber and/or one or more components that are not located inside a process chamber. The etch components <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be employed, for example, in dry-etching techniques where the mechanism of etching has a physical basis (e.g., glow-discharge sputtering, ion-milling), a chemical basis (e.g., plasma etching), and a combination of bases (e.g., reactive ion etching (RIE), ion-enhanced etching). The etch components <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be operatively connected to the etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> to supply data concerning current operating characteristics (e.g., temperature, pressure, formula). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The light <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be generated by many different light sources, and in one example aspect of the present invention the light <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is generated by a frequency-stabilized laser. The etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may direct the light <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> at substantially all of the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and/or at selected portions of the wafer. By way of illustration, in one example aspect of the present invention, the light <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be directed at selected portions of the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, where such portions provide data sufficient to generate scatterometry signatures. A light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> reflected from the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is collected by the etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, which may then employ scatterometry techniques to analyze the reflected light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to determine one or more etch results achieved on the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. For example, the width of lines may be analyzed. Other parameters including, but not limited to horizontal etch rate, vertical etch rate, etch-rate percent uniformity and isotropic versus anisotropic effects may also be analyzed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that the surface of the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, including features, can both reflect and refract the light <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, so that the light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> can be a complex reflected and/or refracted light. The scatterometry analysis can include comparing one or more scatterometry signatures associated with the reflected light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> to one or more scatterometry signatures stored in a signature data store <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Such signatures may be generated, for example, by combining phase and intensity information associated with the reflected light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. As etching progresses, light reflecting from a wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may produce various signatures. The sequence in which such signatures are generated can be employed to determine the rate at which etching is progressing, which can in turn be employed to characterize the etch process. For example, at a first point in time T<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, light reflected from the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may produce a signature S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> that indicates that lines with a first width W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> have been produced. Similarly, at a second point in time T<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, light reflected from the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may produce a signature S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> that indicates that lines with a second width W<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> have been produced and at a third point in time T<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, light reflected from the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may produce a signature S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> that indicates that lines with a third width W<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> have been produced. Analyzing the sequence of signatures, and the time required to produce transitions between such signatures can facilitate determining whether etching is progressing at an acceptable rate. Furthermore, analyzing the sequence of signatures can be employed to establish cause/effect relationships between adaptations made to etch parameters (e.g., time, temperature, direction, pressure, formula) and etch results (e.g., profile, CDs, depth, etch rate). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Adaptation information can be generated from such sequence analysis to produce suggestions concerning adaptations to be made to one or more etch parameters. For example, a suggestion that one or more reactive ion etching formulae be altered to affect the etching rate based on the signature sequence analysis may be generated. Thus, rather than the conventional etch/break/examine sequence, the present invention facilitates gathering real-time data concerning an etch process, which provides advantages over such conventional systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The signature data store <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can store data in data structures including, but not limited to one or more lists, arrays, tables, databases, stacks, heaps, linked lists and data cubes. The signature data store <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can reside on one physical device and/or may be distributed between two or more physical devices (e.g., disk drives, tape drives, memory units). Analyses associated with the reflected light <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and/or the signatures stored in the signature data store <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be employed to suggest adaptations to one or more etching components <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. It is to be appreciated that the etching components <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can include, but are not limited to, etching components associated with descum etch steps performed before a main etch, PR trim etch steps, BARC (breakthrough anti-reflective coating) etch steps and main etch steps. It is to be further appreciated that the etching components <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> can be employed to remove exposed regions of a positive photoresist mask and/or unexposed regions of a negative photoresist mask using techniques like reactive ion etching, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The precision with which resist portions are removed to create fine line patterns and the resulting precision in the distance between the remaining portions corresponds to the precision with which desired profiles, depths, CDs, etc. are achieved. Therefore, the precision of the processing performed by the etch components <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is directly related to the feature sizes and CDs that can be achieved on the wafer <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Gathering real time etch process data facilitates determining the effect of controlling the etch components <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and thus facilitates more quickly and more accurately determining desired etch component <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> adaptations that will result in higher quality ICs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is illustrated directing a light <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> at a wafer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and receiving back a reflected light <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. The etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can be a standalone device and/or can also be distributed between two or more cooperating devices and/or processes. The etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> can reside in one physical or logical device (e.g., computer, process) and/or be distributed between two or more physical or logical devices. The etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may include one or more components that are located inside a process chamber and/or one or more components that are not located inside a process chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The reflected light <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> will be affected by factors including, but not limited to the chemical properties of the wafer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and/or the layers on the wafer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the size, shape and location of features on the wafer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, the size, shape and location of gratings on the wafer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and the size, shape and location of spaces between such features. By way of illustration, different materials that may be etched, (e.g., refractory metal silicides, polycides, aluminum, aluminum alloys, polysilicon, silicon nitride and silicon dioxide) may have different chemical properties that affect the reflected light <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. By way of further illustration, a gap D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> between a first feature <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> and a second feature <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> is illustrated. The first feature <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> is illustrated as having an oxide layer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> substantially covered by a hardened photoresist layer <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the second feature <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> is illustrated as having an oxide layer <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> substantially covered by a hardened photoresist layer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. One or more etching components <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are illustrated operatively connected to the etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Such operative connection facilitates the etching components <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> providing information concerning operating parameters (e.g., temperature, formula, angle, direction, pressure) associated with the etch components <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The etch components <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, which may be one or more of a variety of etch components known in the art can be employed to remove oxide that is not protected by the hardened resist layers <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Thus, portions of the oxide layer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may be removed as a result of etch processes associated with the etch components <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The rate at which the oxide layers <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> are removed and the precision with which they are removed can produce one or more measurable etch results (e.g., CDs, depth, profile) that can be analyzed via the reflected light <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The gap D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and/or the geometry of the layers <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> and/or the relationships between the geometry of the layers <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> can be measured by the etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to determine cause/effect relationships between operating parameters (e.g., temperature, formula, angle, direction, pressure) associated with the etch components <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and results achieved on the wafer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. For example, a signature associated with the gap D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the geometry of the layers <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> may indicate that a first set of operating parameters produced a first etch result. Furthermore, the results may indicate that further adaptation of the operating parameters of the etching components <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be desired. Thus, information operable to determine suggested adjustments to the etch components <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be generated by the etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> As etching of the wafer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> progresses, light reflecting from the wafer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and/or the features <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> may produce various signatures. The sequence in which such signatures are generated can be employed to determine the rate at which etching is progressing. Similarly, the sequence in which such signatures are generated can be employed to determine cause/effect relationships between adaptations to the etch components <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and etch results monitored on the wafer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> By way of illustration, at a first point in time T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, light reflected from the wafer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and/or the features <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> may produce a signature S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that indicates that the gap D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has reached a first measurement. At that point in time T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, an adaptation may be made to one or more of the etch components <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Thus, at a second point in time T<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, light reflected from the wafer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and/or the features <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> may produce a signature S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> that indicates that the gap D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has reached a second measurement, and thus a direct correlation can be made between the adaptations to the etch components <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and the sequence of signatures &lcub;S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&rcub;. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> To determine the optimal adaptation to be made at the point in time T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the etch process that leads to the conditions at T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be replicated, and then a different adaptation may be made at the second first point in time T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Then at a second second point in time T<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, light reflected from the wafer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may produce a signature S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> that indicates that the gap D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has reached a third measurement. Thus, the difference sequence of signatures &lcub;S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>,S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>&rcub; and &lcub;S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>,S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>&rcub; can be employed to determine the optimal adaptation at time T<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> in the etch process being characterized. Such real time imaging of the etch results provides advantages over the conventional etch/break/examine sequence. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, measurements that may affect signatures generated by a scatterometry system associated with characterizing an etch process are illustrated. Controlling such measurements (e.g., gate width and thickness, linewidth and thickness) can be important to reliable and efficient operation of an integrated circuit. For example, both gate delay and drive current are proportional to the inverse of the gate length. Thus, gate lengths should be tightly controlled across chips and wafers to facilitate correlating and sequencing signals. A wafer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is illustrated with two features <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. The feature <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> is illustrated with an oxide layer <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and a hardened photoresist layer <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the feature <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> is illustrated with an oxide layer <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and a hardened photoresist layer <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. While the oxide layers <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> are separated by a distance D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, this distance may, for example, be too small for reliable operation of the integrated circuit being fabricated on the wafer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> or to allow for the creation of a subsequent intervening feature in the gap measured by D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A desired critical dimension for the distance between the oxide layer <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and the oxide layer <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> may be the distance D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. For example, a gap of size D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> may be required to facilitate fabricating a subsequent feature that will reside between the features <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. Lithography sufficient to harden the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> and the photoresist layer <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> may have been achieved in earlier fabrication steps, but such precise lithography may go to waste if precise etching of the features <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> can not be achieved. For example, sophisticated lithography may have produced the hardened photoresist <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> with a desired width of D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Similarly, sophisticated lithography may have produced the hardened photoresist layer <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> with have a desired width of D<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, which should suffice to facilitate etching the oxide layers <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> if precise etching control is possible. But if precise etching control is not possible, then the distance D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may be maintained, and reliable operation may not be achieved and/or the intervening feature may not be able to be created. While the distances D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through D<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are illustrated as horizontal distances, it is to be appreciated that distances in other directions (e.g., vertical distances D<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, angular distances, etc), may also be analyzed in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Thus, the present invention facilitates generating information concerning the distances D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the resulting topographies of resist and oxide layers. A scatterometry-based real time image of the features <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> can be employed to characterize an etch process, and to determine the desirability of adaptations to one or more etch parameters (e.g., temperature, formula, angle, direction, pressure). Such information, generated, at least in part, in response to in situ reflected light being analyzed by scatterometry techniques can be employed to generate process history data that can be employed to adapt future etch processes that are characterized by machine learning techniques that have access to such history data, thus providing advantages over conventional systems. For example, one or more signatures associated with the wafer <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and/or the features <highlight><bold>370</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> can be generated. At a first point in time T<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a signature S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be generated that indicates that desired critical dimensions have not been achieved. Thus, an etching process may be adapted in an attempt to achieve the desired critical dimension. Then, at a second point in time T<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a signature S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may be generated that indicates that although the desired critical dimensions have still not been achieved, that progress toward the desired critical dimensions have occurred. Thus, the adaptation undertaken at T<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be identified as a beneficial adaptation. The etching process may then be continued until a later point in time T<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, when a signature S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> indicates that the desired critical dimensions have been achieved. Thus, a cause and effect relationship between the adaptation at T<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the signature sequence &lcub;S<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, S<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>&rcub; may be determined. But the signature S<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> may have indicated that the adaptation to the etching process produced a movement away from desired critical dimensions. Thus, the adaptation at T<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be identified as an undesirable adaptation and future etch processes may not attempt the same adaptation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is illustrated monitoring an etch process <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> being applied to a wafer <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>, whereupon one or more features <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> are being etched. While features <highlight><bold>470</bold></highlight> are illustrated, it is to be appreciated that gratings may also be analyzed in accordance with the present invention. It is to be appreciated that the etch process <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> may be performed by etching components associated with etch steps performed before a main etch (e.g. descum etch), PR trim etch steps, BARC (breakthrough anti-reflective coating) etch steps and main etch steps and that the etching components may provide feedback data concerning current operating conditions (e.g., time, temperature, heat, pressure, angle, direction) to the etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The etch process <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> can be monitored by the etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, for example, to acquire scatterometry signatures associated with the widths DX and DY and the effect of one or more adaptations to the etch process <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> on the widths DX and DY and/or the rate of change of DX and/or DY based on the adaptations. Retrieving a real time image of the etch profile via in-situ retrieval and/or analysis of information concerning direct measurements of the widths DX and DY, and/or similar information from one or more gratings, and producing adaptation data that can be employed to adapt the etch process <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, and/or other etch processes, facilitates achieving more precise CDs and thus provides advantages over conventional systems. By way of illustration, conventional laser reflectance monitoring methods do not provide in situ etch rate information. By way of further illustration, in laser interferometry methods, the laser must be focused on an open flat region, thus prime wafer real estate is sacrificed for the testing area. Also, such laser interferometry methods may only provide information on a limited area of the wafer surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5, a</cross-reference> wafer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is illustrated. The wafer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>, at a step A in an IC manufacturing process, initially is not covered with layers of oxides and/or resists. At a step B in the manufacturing process, the wafer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is covered with an oxide layer <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. The oxide layer <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> is employed in constructing one or more features on the wafer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. At a later step C in the manufacturing process, a resist layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is deposited on top of the oxide layer <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. The resist layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> is employed to enable selective removal of portions of the oxide layer <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>, thus facilitating constructing one or more features on the wafer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. The ability to precisely control the selective removal facilitates achieving desired feature profiles and leads to improvements in IC quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, at a step D in the manufacturing process, the wafer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> (with the oxide layer <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> and the resist layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight>) is exposed to a light source <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> through a reticle <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight>. The reticle <highlight><bold>506</bold></highlight> facilitates exposing only selected portions of the resist layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> to light from the light source <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight>. Portions of the resist layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> that were exposed to light from the light source <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> may be developed and hardened, while portions of the resist layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> not exposed to the light from the light source <highlight><bold>508</bold></highlight> may not develop, and may remain susceptible to removal by various processes. At a subsequent step E in the manufacturing process, the non-hardened portions of the resist layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> may be removed, exposing portions of the oxide layer <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight>. At step E, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the resist layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> has had two sections removed, leaving three areas of resist. The precision with which the resist portions can be removed, and the resulting precision in the distance between the remaining portions can be important to achieving desired feature profiles, by providing precise fields to be etched. Gathering a real time image of the resist as it is processed facilitates characterizing an etch process. Rather than employing a conventional etch/break/examine cycle, real time images of the resist <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> may be employed to determine whether an etch process is producing desirable results and thus may similarly be employed to determine whether adaptations to the etch process are desired. Such real time image analysis and resulting adaptations can be made at an earlier point in time than is possible in the conventional etch/break/examine cycle, and thus advantages in speed, accuracy and causation (e.g., cause/effect) may be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Thus turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, portions of the oxide layer <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> that are not covered by hardened portions of the resist layer <highlight><bold>504</bold></highlight> can be etched away by one or more etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) at a later manufacturing step F. Etching away precise amounts of the oxide layer <highlight><bold>502</bold></highlight> from precise locations facilitates achieving desired feature profiles. For example, a feature <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> can be separated from a feature <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> by a space <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight>. Precise etching can facilitate controlling the shape and/or size of the feature <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> to facilitate controlling the shape and/or size of the space <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> between the feature <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> and the feature <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>, which can lead to increases in packing densities and improved feature profiles. Similarly, the feature <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> can be separated from a feature <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> by a space <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight> whose size and/or shape can likewise be precisely controlled. Conventionally, the image produced by the features <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> and the spaces <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight> may not be examined until the end of the etching process. Thus, intermediate results that may affect the quality of the IC may not be examined. By providing real time imagery of the features <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> and the spaces <highlight><bold>716</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>718</bold></highlight>, such intermediate results may not be ignored, with resulting increases in IC quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Although three features <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>714</bold></highlight> are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, it is to be appreciated that a greater or lesser number of features can be etched by systems employing the present invention. The present invention facilitates determining whether a feature profile (e.g., the sloped portion on the right side of feature <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight>) matches a desired feature profile and thus facilitates generating feedback information that can be employed to suggest adaptations to the etching process being characterized by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> presents a feature <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> with a multi-slope profile fabricated on a wafer <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. Etch techniques for constructing the feature <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>, including multi-layer techniques are known in the art, but characterizing and/or monitoring such techniques may involve the conventional etch/break/examine cycle. Thus, intermediate adjustments that may facilitate higher quality profiles may not be made. Thus, the etching techniques may benefit from in situ monitoring, which facilitates producing real-time imagery to facilitate understanding the etch processes involved in creating the feature <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight>. By way of illustration, the angle <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> may vary depending on the angle <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight>. As angle <highlight><bold>808</bold></highlight> becomes more acute, the feature <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> may benefit from the angle <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> being more acute. Similarly, the angle <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> may depend on the angle <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight>. As the angle <highlight><bold>810</bold></highlight> becomes more acute, feature <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> may benefit from the angle <highlight><bold>806</bold></highlight> becoming more obtuse. Thus, by monitoring signatures associated with light reflected from the feature <highlight><bold>802</bold></highlight> and/or the wafer <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> during the fabrication process, etch processes that affect subsequent dependent angles may be better understood. Thus, adapting the etch process in response to real time imagery associated with preceding controlling angles, which may vary from feature to feature, or wafer to wafer due to intra-wafer variations and/or wafer to wafer variations, provides advantages over conventional systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> presents a feature <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> with a multi-slope profile fabricated on a wafer <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. The geometry of the feature <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is more complicated than the geometry of a rectangular feature, for example. Thus, more complicated etch techniques may be required to fabricate the feature <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. Techniques for constructing the feature <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> are known in the art, but such techniques, which may have been developed through the conventional etch/break/examine cycle may benefit from in situ monitoring, which facilitates producing real-time feedback that can be employed to better understand, and thus adapt the fabrication process. By way of illustration, the angles <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> may vary depending on the height of the feature <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. As the feature <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> becomes taller, the feature <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> may benefit from the angle <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> being more obtuse and the angle <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> being more obtuse. Thus, by monitoring signatures associated with light reflected from the feature <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> and/or the wafer <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> during the fabrication process, etching parameters (e.g., time, temperature, pressure, direction, angle) that affect fabricating dependent angles may be adapted in response to developing controlling parameters (e.g., height), which may vary from feature to feature, or wafer to wafer due to intra-wafer variations and/or wafer to wafer variations, for example. Being able to monitor a variation during fabrication (e.g., height of feature <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>) facilitates adapting an etching process to account for intermediate results that may not be observable through conventional methods. Additionally and/or alternatively, data collected while monitoring the formation of the feature <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> can be employed to facilitate reproducing and/or adapting process conditions in subsequent fabrication processes employed to create features similar to feature <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight>. Thus, adaptive learning techniques can be employed to improve semiconductor feature manufacture, providing advantages over conventional systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates a system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> for producing a real time image of a profile that can be employed in characterizing an etch process. The system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> operates to monitor one or more etch components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> and a wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> whereupon one or more features and/or gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> are located in order to understand etch processes and thus to facilitate mitigating fabricating poorly etched features and wafers. An etching process characterizing system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>, a processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> and an etch component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> work cooperatively to control the etch components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> and to provide feedback information concerning the etch component <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> operating parameters (e.g., temperature, formula, angle, direction, pressure). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> The etch components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> are coupled to and controlled directly by the etch component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>. The etch component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> receives information and/or instructional commands from the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> determines the content and type of information transmitted to the etch component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> according to its analysis of data received from and collected by the characterizing system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>. Thus, through the interaction of components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>, the system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> has the ability to generate real time images of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> and thus to facilitate altering subsequent etch processes for the same wafer and/or for subsequent wafers. In addition, by communicating measurements relating to recently etched features/wafers to the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> can control the etching component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>, which can thus regulate the one or more etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> to facilitate obtaining more precise and improved etching processes. Thus etching errors can be mitigated and higher packing densities and smaller feature sizes can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> includes one or more etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> that are selectively controlled to facilitate controlled etching of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. One or more target light sources <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> project light onto respective portions of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. A portion of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> may have one or more gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> and/or features located on that portion. Light reflected and/or refracted by the one or more gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> is collected by one or more light detecting components <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight>, and processed by an etching process characterizing system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> to measure at least one parameter relating to the etching of one or more features and/or the one or more gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight>. For example, spaces between portions of the grating <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> and spaces between the gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> can be measured and compared to desired critical dimensions (CDs). The reflected light is measured with respect to the incident light in order to obtain the various parameters relating to the gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The characterizing system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> includes a scatterometry system <highlight><bold>1075</bold></highlight>. It is to be appreciated that any suitable scatterometry system may be employed to carry out the present invention, and such systems are intended to fall within the scope of the claims appended hereto. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A light source <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> (e.g., a laser) provides light to the one or more target light sources <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> via the characterizing system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the light source <highlight><bold>1090</bold></highlight> is a frequency-stabilized laser, however, it will be appreciated that any laser or other light source (e.g., laser diode or helium neon (HeNe) gas laser) suitable for carrying out the present invention may be employed. One or more light detecting components <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight> (e.g., photo detector, photo diodes) collect light reflecting from the one or more gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight> and/or the one or more features being etched. The characterizing system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> may also process the measured light data into a data form compatible with or understandable to the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> is operatively coupled to the characterizing system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> and receives the measured etching parameter data from the characterizing system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> records the acceptability of etching measurements associated with the respective portions of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> by examining measured etch results and comparing such measured etch result values to stored acceptable and unacceptable etch result values. The etch result values may be associated with one or more signatures stored, for example, in a memory <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>. In determining the acceptability and/or progress of an on-going and/or recently completed etch process, the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> may also determine to what extent, if any, adjustments to the etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> may affect subsequent etch processes. Upon making the determination, the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> may provide suggested adaptations to the etch process. In one example of the present invention, the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> transmits this information to the etch component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight>, which then makes one or more adjustments to the etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> for a subsequent iteration of the etch process characterization method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As described above, the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> is also coupled to the etching component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> that directs and controls the one or more etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>. The etching component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> is controlled, at least in part, by the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> to selectively vary the operation of the respective etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>. Each respective portion of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> is associated with a corresponding etching component <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> monitors the etching of one or more features and/or one or more gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight>, and selectively regulates the etching of each portion via the corresponding etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight>. The transmission and relay of information between the characterizing system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>, the etch component driving system <highlight><bold>1060</bold></highlight> and the etch components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> facilitates receiving effective feed back information (e.g., real time imagery coupled with operating parameters that produced the image) that in turn facilitates improving IC quality by more quickly and more accurately characterizing etch process that facilitates adapting such etch processes to produce more precisely etched features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>, or central processing unit, may be any of a plurality of commercially available processors. The processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> is programmed to monitor, control and operate the various components within the system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> in order to carry out the various functions described herein. The manner in which the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> is programmed to carry out the functions relating to the present invention will be apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art based on the description provided herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> A memory <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight>, which is operatively coupled to the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>, is also included in the system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> and serves to store, among other things, program code executed by the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> for carrying out operating functions of the system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> as described herein. For example, the memory <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> can hold patterns to which observed data can be compared. The memory <highlight><bold>1050</bold></highlight> also serves as a storage medium for temporarily storing etching parameter data such as etching progress values, etching progress tables, component coordinate tables, grating sizes, grating shapes, scatterometry information, etch measurements (e.g., CDs, depth, profile info) and other data that may be employed in carrying out the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A power supply <highlight><bold>1080</bold></highlight> provides operating power to the system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight>. Any suitable power supply (e.g., battery, line power) may be employed to carry out the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, one aspect of the present invention is shown. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates the system <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> being employed to measure the etching of a particular portion of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. The target light source <highlight><bold>1020</bold></highlight> directs a light <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> incident to the surface of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. The angle of a reflected light <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>, reflected from the surface of the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight> will vary in accordance with the evolving dimensions of the gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight>, and/or with the evolving dimensions of one or more features being etched in the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. Thus, by comparing the evolving dimensions of the one or more features and/or gratings <highlight><bold>1015</bold></highlight>, cause/effect relationships between etch process operating parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure, time, formula, direction, angle) and etch results can be understood and stored. The one or more light detecting components <highlight><bold>1025</bold></highlight> collect the reflected light <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> and transmit the collected light, and/or data associated with the collected light, to the characterizing system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight>. The characterizing system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> collects the reflected light <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>, and/or related data, in accordance with scatterometry techniques. The characterizing system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> then provides the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> with the data corresponding to the etching characteristics associated with the wafer <highlight><bold>1010</bold></highlight>. The data may include, for example, information relating to the dimensions of etched areas relative to, or independent of, dimensions of unetched areas, and/or surface characteristics as well as other measurements relating to the etch process. In one example of the present invention, such relationships may be employed in linear and/or non-linear machine learning techniques to adapt etch processes characterized by the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The etch process characterizing system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> may provide direct, real-time measurements to the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight>, as opposed to measurements taken according to pre-determined system schedules and measurements taken post-fabrication as is customary in conventional systems. Providing direct, real-time feedback to the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> facilitates selective adaptation of etch processes and improved etching precision over conventional methods and/or apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Turning now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, another aspect of the present invention is shown. In addition to the methods described above, a wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> may be logically partitioned into grid blocks to facilitate identifying positions or locations associated with characterizing the etch process. Obtaining such positions or locations may facilitate determining to what extent, if any, etch process parameter adjustments are necessary. Obtaining such information may also assist in determining problem areas associated with etch processes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> illustrates a perspective view of a chuck <highlight><bold>1230</bold></highlight> supporting the wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, whereupon one or more features and/or gratings may be formed. The wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> may be divided into a grid pattern as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Each grid block (XY) of the grid pattern corresponds to a particular portion of the wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>, and each grid block is associated with one or more gratings and/or one or more portions of one or more gratings. The grid blocks are individually monitored for etch results and etching parameters associated with each grid block may similarly be individually monitored and/or recorded which facilitates establishing cause/effect relationships. It is to be appreciated that the size and/or shape of gratings can be manipulated to facilitate analyzing different etch results. For example, for a particular layer in an integrated circuit, a CD relating to a width between features may be important. Thus, the gratings can be patterned to optimize analyzing the width between features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, one or more gratings in the respective portions of the wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> (X<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>Y<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>. . . X<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>, Y<highlight><subscript>12</subscript></highlight>) are monitored for CDs produced during the etch process using reflected light, the characterizing system <highlight><bold>1070</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) and the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>). Exemplary CD measurements produced during etching for each grating are shown. As can be seen, the CD measurement at coordinate X<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>Y<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>is substantially higher than the CD measurement of the other portions XY. It is to be appreciated that the wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> may be mapped into any suitable number of grid blocks, and any suitable number of gratings may formed on the wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight>. Although the present invention is described with respect to one etching component <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> corresponding to one grid block XY, it is to be appreciated that any suitable number of etching components <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight> corresponding to any suitable number of wafer portions/grid blocks may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> is a representative table of CD measurements taken for the various grid blocks that have been correlated with acceptable CD values for the portions of the wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> mapped by the respective grid blocks. As can be seen, all the grid blocks, except grid block X<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>Y<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, have CD measurements corresponding to an acceptable CD table value (T<highlight><subscript>A</subscript></highlight>) (e.g., are within an expected range of etching measurements), while grid block X<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>Y<highlight><subscript>6 </subscript></highlight>has an undesired CD table value (T<highlight><subscript>U</subscript></highlight>). Thus, the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> has determined that an undesirable etching result exists at the portion of the wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> mapped by grid block X<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>Y<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>. Accordingly, the processor <highlight><bold>1040</bold></highlight> may suggest one or more adaptations for at least an etching component <highlight><bold>1030</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>,<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, which corresponds to the portion of the wafer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> mapped at grid block X<highlight><subscript>7</subscript></highlight>Y<highlight><subscript>6</subscript></highlight>, to attempt to produce an acceptable CD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> The measurements illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and the corresponding determinations illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> can be employed together to produce a real time image of the acceptability of an etch process. Thus, rather than waiting until the end of a conventional etch/break/examine sequence, an etch process being characterized through such real-time imagery may be examined and/or terminated at an earlier point in time, producing time savings over conventional systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> illustrates an exemplary scatterometry system collecting reflected light. Light from a laser <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> is brought to focus in any suitable well-known manner to form a beam <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight>. A sample, such as a wafer <highlight><bold>1504</bold></highlight>, is placed in the path of the beam <highlight><bold>1502</bold></highlight> and a photo detector or photo multiplier <highlight><bold>1506</bold></highlight> of any suitable well-known construction. Different detector methods may be employed to determine the scattered power. To obtain a grating pitch, the photo detector or photo multiplier <highlight><bold>1506</bold></highlight> may be mounted on a rotation stage <highlight><bold>1508</bold></highlight> of any suitable well-known design. A microprocessor <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight>, of any suitable well-known design, may be used to process detector readouts, including, but not limited to, angular locations of different diffracted orders leading to diffraction grating pitches being calculated. Thus, light reflected from the sample <highlight><bold>1504</bold></highlight> may be accurately measured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> In view of the exemplary systems shown and described above, methodologies that may be implemented in accordance with the present invention will be better appreciated with reference to the flow diagram of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. While for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodology of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is shown and described as a series of blocks, it is to be understood and appreciated that the present invention is not limited by the order of the blocks, as some blocks may, in accordance with the present invention, occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other blocks from that shown and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating one particular methodology for carrying out the present invention. At <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>, general initializations are performed. Such initializations can include, but are not limited to, establishing pointers, allocating memory, setting variables and establishing communication channels. At <highlight><bold>1610</bold></highlight>, a grid map of a plurality of grid blocks &ldquo;XY&rdquo; is created. At <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight>, etching results are measured from various wafer portions mapped by the respective grid blocks XY. At <highlight><bold>1630</bold></highlight>, a determination is made concerning whether all grid block measurements have been taken. If the determination at <highlight><bold>1630</bold></highlight> is NO, then processing returns to <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight>. If the determination at <highlight><bold>1630</bold></highlight> is YES, then at <highlight><bold>1640</bold></highlight>, determined etching result values are analyzed and compared against stored etching result values for the respective portions of a wafer. In an alternative example of the present invention, the determination at <highlight><bold>1630</bold></highlight> may concern whether a sufficient number of grid blocks have been measured to facilitate valid analysis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>1650</bold></highlight>, a determination is made concerning whether etching values are unacceptable. If etching values are acceptable, then processing continues at <highlight><bold>1660</bold></highlight> where a determination is made concerning whether desired CDs have been achieved. If desired CDs have been achieved, then processing can conclude. Otherwise, processing continues at <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight>. If unacceptable values are found at <highlight><bold>1650</bold></highlight>, processing proceeds to <highlight><bold>1670</bold></highlight> where a determination is made concerning whether further adaptation to the etching process being characterized is warranted. By way of illustration, the unacceptable values may indicate that portions of the wafer and/or the entire wafer being processed have been damaged to such an extent that further adaptations to the etch process are unwarranted. By way of further illustration, analysis of the unacceptable dimensions may indicate that a simple adaptation is appropriate. At <highlight><bold>1680</bold></highlight>, one or more suggestions for adaptations to the etching components may be computed. The present iteration is then ended and the process returns to <highlight><bold>1620</bold></highlight> to perform another iteration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> Turning now to FIGS. <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the concept of scatterometry and how it is employed in the present invention is discussed. Scatterometry is a technique for extracting information about a surface upon which an incident light has been directed. Scatterometry is a metrology that relates the geometry of a sample to its scattering effects. Scatterometry is based on the reconstruction of the grating profile from its optical diffraction responses. Information concerning properties including, but not limited to, dishing, erosion, profile, thickness of thin films and critical dimensions of features present on the surface can be extracted. The information can be extracted by comparing the phase and/or intensity of the light directed onto the surface with phase and/or intensity signals of a complex reflected and/or diffracted light resulting from the incident light reflecting from and/or diffracting through the surface upon which the incident light was directed. The intensity and/or the phase of the reflected and/or diffracted light will change based on properties of the surface upon which the light is directed. Such properties include, but are not limited to, the chemical properties of the surface, the planarity of the surface, features on the surface, voids in the surface, and the number and/or type of layers beneath the surface. In the present invention, the intensity and/or phase of the reflected and/or diffracted light will be examined as it relates to critical dimensions desired on the wafer being etched. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Different combinations of the above-mentioned properties will have different effects on the phase and/or intensity of the incident light resulting in substantially unique intensity/phase signatures in the complex reflected and/or diffracted light. Thus, by examining a signal (signature or stored value) library of intensity/phase signatures, a determination can be made concerning the properties of the surface. Such substantially unique phase/intensity signatures are produced by light reflected from and/or refracted by different surfaces due, at least in part, to the complex index of refraction of the surface onto which the light is directed. The complex index of refraction (N) can be computed by examining the index of refraction (n) of the surface and an extinction coefficient (k). One such computation of the complex index of refraction can be described by the equation:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>N&equals;n&minus;jk,</italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> where j is an imaginary number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> The signal (signature) library can be constructed from observed intensity/phase signatures and/or signatures generated by modeling and simulation. By way of illustration, when exposed to a first incident light of known intensity, wavelength and phase, a first feature on a wafer can generate a first phase/intensity signature. Similarly, when exposed to the first incident light of known intensity, wavelength and phase, a second feature on a wafer can generate a second phase/intensity signature. For example, a line of a first width may generate a first signature while a line of a second width may generate a second signature. Observed signatures can be combined with simulated and modeled signatures to form the signal (signature) library. Simulation and modeling can be employed to produce signatures against which measured phase/intensity signatures can be matched. In one exemplary aspect of the present invention, simulation, modeling and observed signatures are stored in a signal (signature) library containing over three hundred thousand phase/intensity signatures. Thus, when the phase/intensity signals are received from scatterometry detecting components, the phase/intensity signals can be pattern matched, for example, to the library of signals to determine whether the signals correspond to a stored signature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> To illustrate the principles described above, reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 through 22</cross-reference>. Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, an incident light <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is directed at a surface <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, upon which one or more features <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> may exist. The incident light <highlight><bold>902</bold></highlight> is reflected as reflected light <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The properties of the surface <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, including but not limited to, thickness, uniformity, planarity, chemical composition and the presence of features, can affect the reflected light <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. The features <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> are raised upon the surface <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>. The phase and intensity of the reflected light <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> can be measured and plotted, as shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference>. The phase <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight> of the reflected light <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight> can be plotted, as can the intensity <highlight><bold>962</bold></highlight> of the reflected light <highlight><bold>904</bold></highlight>. Such plots can be employed to compare measured signals with signatures stored in a signature library using techniques like pattern matching, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, an incident light <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> is directed onto a surface <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> upon which one or more depressions <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> appear. The incident light <highlight><bold>912</bold></highlight> is reflected as reflected light <highlight><bold>914</bold></highlight>. Like the one or more features <highlight><bold>906</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>) may affect an incident beam, so too may the one or more depressions <highlight><bold>916</bold></highlight> affect an incident beam. Thus, it is to be appreciated that scatterometry can be employed to measure features appearing on a surface, features appearing in a surface, and properties of a surface itself, regardless of features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, complex reflections and refractions of an incident light <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight> are illustrated. The reflection and refraction of the incident light <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight> can be affected by factors including, but not limited to, the presence of one or more features <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight>, and the composition of the substrate <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> upon which the features <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight> reside. For example, properties of the substrate <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> including, but not limited to the thickness of a layer <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, the chemical properties of the layer <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, the opacity and/or reflectivity of the layer <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, the thickness of a layer <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>, the chemical properties of the layer <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>, the opacity and/or reflectivity of the layer <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>, the thickness of a layer <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight>, the chemical properties of the layer <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight>, and the opacity and/or reflectivity of the layer <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight> can affect the reflection and/or refraction of the incident light <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight>. Thus, a complex reflected and/or refracted light <highlight><bold>942</bold></highlight> may result from the incident light <highlight><bold>940</bold></highlight> interacting with the features <highlight><bold>928</bold></highlight>, and/or the layers <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight>. Although three layers <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight> are illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, it is to be appreciated that a substrate can be formed of a greater or lesser number of such layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</cross-reference>, one of the properties from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference> is illustrated further. The substrate <highlight><bold>920</bold></highlight> can be formed of one or more layers <highlight><bold>922</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>926</bold></highlight>. The phase <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> of the reflected and/or refracted light <highlight><bold>942</bold></highlight> can depend, at least in part, on the thickness of a layer, for example, the layer <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight>. Thus, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, the phase <highlight><bold>952</bold></highlight> of the reflected light <highlight><bold>942</bold></highlight> differs from the phase <highlight><bold>950</bold></highlight> due, at least in part, to the different thickness of the layer <highlight><bold>924</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Thus, scatterometry is a technique that can be employed to extract information about a surface upon which an incident light has been directed. The information can be extracted by analyzing phase and/or intensity signals of a complex reflected and/or diffracted light. The intensity and/or the phase of the reflected and/or diffracted light will change based on properties of the surface upon which the light is directed, resulting in substantially unique signatures that can be analyzed to determine one or more properties of the surface upon which the incident light was directed. Using scatterometry in the present invention facilitates a relatively non-invasive approach to characterizing an etch process by producing, for example, real time profile images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> Described above are preferred embodiments of the present invention. It is, of course, not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methodologies for purposes of describing the present invention, but one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many further combinations and permutations of the present invention are possible. Accordingly, the present invention is intended to embrace all such alterations, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
