<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A conventional tape measure generally includes a case and a reel of the tape is received in the case. An end of the tape can be pulled out from the case and marks are printed on the tape so as to measure a distance between two points. A lock and rewind switch is located on a front surface on the case in order to hold or fix the tape. This is especially convenient for the users to check the marks on the tape. However, the conventional tape measure lacks of light or illumination device so that the tape measure is not used in a dark area. There could not have enough illumination device at each of the two points to be measured so that when the users use the tape measure in the dark, the users have to prepare a torchlight to see the marks on the tape. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a tape measure which comprises a case having a reel of tape received therein and a slot is defined in a front surface of the case so that the tape is pulled from the slot. A lock and rewind switch is pivotally connected to the case and a light is engaged with the front surface of case and located above the slot. A light switch is connected to a rear surface of the case and electrically connected to the light. A space is defined in the case for receiving a battery therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The primary object of the present invention is to provide a tape measure that has a light connected to the case so as to assist the users to see the marks on the tape in dark. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention will become more obvious from the following description when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings which show, for purposes of illustration only, a preferred embodiment in accordance with the present invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the tape measure of the present invention comprises a case which is composed of a first part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a second part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which is to be matched with the first part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by bolts. A reel of tape <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is mounted to a shaft extending from an inside of the first part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a slot <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> defined in a front surface of the case so that the tape <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is pulled from the slot <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A recess <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is defined in a front surface of the first part <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a lock and rewind switch <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is pivotally received in the recess <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and a aperture <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is defined through the case so that a light <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is engaged with the aperture <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of case. The light <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is located above the slot <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. A light switch <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is connected to a recess <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> defined in a rear surface of the case and electrically connected to the light <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> by wires <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. A space <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is defined in the case so as to receive a battery <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> therein which powers the light <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The case has a recess <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> defined in a top thereof and a leveling device <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> is received in the recess <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A plurality legs <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> extend from a bottom of the case such that when the legs <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are put on a ground, the user may check the level by checking the bulbs in the leveling device <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the light <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> turns on by pulling the light switch <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and the marks on the tape <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be seen clearly in dark. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> While we have shown and described the embodiment in accordance with the present invention, it should be clear to those skilled in the art that further embodiments may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
