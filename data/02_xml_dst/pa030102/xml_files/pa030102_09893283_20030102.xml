<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">This invention relates to a keyboards with a track operation key, comprising a track located at a proper position of the keyboard. In the track, there is an operation key that can move along the track, and there is also a sensor used to detect the displacement of the operation key and then converting to the motion displacement value that can control the curser movement on the screen. Therefore, through moving the operation key in the track it becomes feasible to control the cursor&apos;s motion directly. For the track and the operation key, they can be set in vertical or horizontal so as to operate the cursor vertically or horizontally. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a keyboard with a track operation key, particularly a track that has an operation key located in the keyboard, to control the displacement of the cursor by moving the operation key in the track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventional keyboards used on computers is to input data to files. Since windows have been widely used in personal computers, every computer has had a mouse to control the movement of the cursor. There is a kind of mouse with a rolling ball on the bottom. Through moving the mouse deriving a relative movement of the rolling ball, the cursor is controlled to move on the screen. Another kind of mouse is provided with a rolling axis implemented the center of the mouse. The cursor movement is controlled by the rolling axis. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Obviously, mouse and keyboards are individual devices. In practical operation, it is needed to move the hand from the keyboard to the mouse, and even is needed to reach the mouse and the cursor&apos;s position. Therefore, the operation speed will be decreased significantly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> However, most modern keyboard designs has leaded to multimedia keyboard. It means that adding extra keys on the keyboards makes the application on the Internet and MP3 feasible. However, there has not been a designation of keyboard with a cursor controller implemented, so that a keyboard with a track operation key is designed to make the keyboard more efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A main object of this invention is to provide a keyboard implemented with a track operation key locating in a proper position on the keyboard. In the track, there is an operation key that can move along the track and a sensor that can detect the motion of the operation key along the track that can be converted into the displacement of the cursor of the screen. Therefore, the movement of the cursor can be controlled directly through moving the operation key in the track. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> For the keyboard with a track operation key of the invention, the track and the operation key can be set vertically to control the moving of the cursor vertically. They can also be set horizontally to control the moving of the cursor horizontally. If the track and the operation key are set vertically and horizontally simultaneously, the moving of the cursor can be controlled vertically and horizontally.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the keyboard with track operation key in this invention includes a keyboard <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. At a proper position of the keyboard <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has a track <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, set on the top of the keyboard <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> horizontally. In the track <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, there is an operation key(<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>) which can move along the track <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the track <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, there is a sensor ( not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) used to detect the displacement value of the operation key <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> moving in the track <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and then convert to the displacement that can control the cursor movement on the screen. In this embodiment, the operation key <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> moves horizontally to operate the displacement of the cursor horizontally. It&apos;s possible to convert the horizontal movement of the operation key <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into a vertical movement, but that is not so smoothly on the operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, another embodiment of this invention has a vertical track <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and an operation key <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. It will be more proper to operate the vertical movement through the track <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the operation key <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Of course, it will be even more useful that the horizontal track <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the operation key <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be located on the top of the keyboard <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the vertical track <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the operation key <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> located on side of the keyboard <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> simultaneously to operate the moving of the cursor horizontally and vertically. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> When the operation key moves to a particular position, we can use another control key, or design the control key in the operation key to set the position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> For sensing and converting the operation keys <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in order to convert the displacement of the operation keys <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> into cursor movement are known to people who are familiar in the art, which is not the feature of this invention, so that no further description will be presented in this speicfication. </paragraph>
