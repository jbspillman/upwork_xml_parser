<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A seamless mouse comprising a base, with an embedding unit at the rear of the base, a coupling unit in it, a pair of activating troughs near its front, a touch switch in the activating trough, to receive command from the touch operation; and a top cover, at the rear of the top cover and opposite the embedding unit being a joining pin to insert into the embedding unit for fastening purpose, inside it and opposite the coupling unit being a coupling post to couple with the coupling unit, at its front and opposite the activating trough being a driving lever, and extending from the top cover itself being the formation of at least one push key. When the top cover is assembled to the base, the joining pin is fastened to the embedding unit, the coupling post is fastened to the coupling unit. When the push key is pressed, the driving lever activates the touch switch in the activating trough, to serve the function of the mouse. Furthermore, the mouse appears to have no seam, and its radial push key will have better control and operation performance. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a seamless mouse, particularly to a mouse which top cover involves the information of radial push keys, so that there is no more clearance between the push key and the top cover, meanwhile, its radial key may have better control and performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Background of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The conventional mouse comes in two types, either two keys or three keys. Either mouse has its keys and its top cover separately produced before they are assembled. Therefore, there shall be some joining seam existing between the push key and the top cover. Furthermore, it has limited length of push key, so the user does not have a good feeling and sense of control. Accordingly, the existing weakness needs improvement. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The primary objective of this invention is to provide a seamless mouse, which comprises a base. At the back of the base is an embedding unit, inside it is a coupling unit, at its front is a pair of activating troughs, inside the activating trough is a touch switch. The mouse further comprises a top cover. At the rear of the top cover and opposite the embedding unit is a joining pin to insert into the embedding unit for fastening purpose, inside it and opposite the coupling unit is a coupling post to couple with the coupling unit, at its front and opposite the activating trough is a driving lever, and extending forward from the top cover itself is the formation of at least one push key. When the top cover is assembled to the base, the joining pin is fastened to the embedding unit, the coupling post fastened to the coupling unit. When the push key is pressed, the driving lever touches the touch switch in the activating trough, to serve the function of the mouse. Furthermore, its appearance involves no seam showing the push keys, and its radial push key will have better control and performance.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a seamless mouse <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the invention comprises a base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, with an embedding unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> at the back of the base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a coupling unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at its center, a pair of activating troughs <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> at its front, and a touch switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the activating trough <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> to receive the command from the touch operation; a top cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, at the rear of the top cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and opposite the embedding unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is a joining key <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to insert in the embedding unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, at the middle and opposite the coupling unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is a coupling post <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to mount onto the coupling unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, with a driving lever <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> at its front and corresponding to the activating trough <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, the top cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> itself extending forward to form at least one push key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When the top cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is assembled to the base <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a joining key <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is joined with the embedding unit <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and the coupling post <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is coupled to the coupling unit <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When the push key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is pressed, the driving lever <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> activates the touch switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in the activating trough <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the key <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of this seamless mouse <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is an extension from the top cover <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> itself, forming a radial key, thus there is no need a clearance between a conventional push key and the top cover itself. Therefore, this invention is not only capable of achieving the functions of a mouse, but it involves no seam, so it has an appearance with a sense of value. Particularly, the radial push key can have better control and operation performance. </paragraph>
