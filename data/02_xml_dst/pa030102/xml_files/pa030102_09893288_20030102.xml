<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A rotational sensor system for detecting rotational velocity and rotational direction of a rotating member, such as a vehicle axle, including a tone ring mounted to the rotating member. The system includes a pair of active sensors mounted adjacent to the tone ring and spaced from one another, which, when activated, produce an electric signal in response to movements in the tone wheel. A processor receives the electric signals from the sensors and generates a signal indicative of rotational velocity and rotational direction of the rotating member. Also, preferably, an output signal is created that uses square waves with different amplitude levels for the signal highs and lows depending upon the direction of rotation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to speed sensing devices for rotating equipment and, in particular, to a speed sensing device that also detects rotational direction of the rotating equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Vehicle wheel speed sensor systems are well known. Rotational speed is used for numerous measurement devices and control systems, including vehicle speedometer readings, vehicle cruise control feedback, and vehicle antilock braking system feedback. Wheel speed sensors can be mounted in any of several locations, such as in wheel bearing assemblies, and in the differential. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Speed sensor systems typically operate by means of a target mounted to rotated with the rotating equipment. This target is paired with, and is separated from, a stationary sensor by an air gap. The stationary sensor generates a signal when the target rotates past it. There are indices around the periphery of the target. The number of times the indices pass by the sensor, or the frequency of signals generated, in a given period of time, is then converted to a rotating speed and passed on to the appropriate measurement device or control system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Vehicle wheel speed sensing systems are typically grouped into two types, active sensor systems and passive sensor systems. Passive sensors do not require a power supply in order to operate. In a passive sensor system, the stationary sensor is a permanent magnet that projects a magnetic field into the air gap. The stationary sensor detects a change in the magnetic field&apos;s reluctance caused by the moving target, typically a toothed wheel made of ferrous material, as it passes through the magnetic field. The output of the passive sensor is a raw analog signal that varies greatly with the rotational speed of the vehicle wheel. The output of the passive sensor is also susceptible to false signals when the wheel is subjected to vibration. In addition, passive sensors are limited to a close clearance air gap of about 1 to 2 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Active sensor systems represent the next generation technology to be utilized in vehicle wheel speed sensing devices. Active sensor systems typically utilize one of two technology devices, which are well known in the art as Hall Effect devices or Magneto-Resistive devices. The two technologies have been found to be comparable in terms of performance. Active sensor systems require a power supply to operate and are further divided into two categories, back-biased sensors and non back-biased sensors. Back-biased sensors generate the magnetic field from the stationary sensor, while the moving target, or encoder, is constructed of ferrous material, as in the passive sensor system. Non-back biased sensors, conversely, generate the magnetic field from the encoder. Because the magnetic field is generated from the moving target, non back-biased stationary sensors do not need magnets, require correspondingly fewer components and are thus smaller than back-biased stationary sensors. Sensors installed in either back-biased or non back-biased form detect the frequency of the changes in voltage of the magnetic field, and direct the output to the appropriate measurement device or control system. The output of the active sensor, in either back-biased or non back-biased form, is a high quality digital signal that varies between fixed values and is not affected by the rotational speed of the wheel. Active sensor control systems are smaller than passive sensor control systems, can function at zero and near zero rotational speed, are immune to false signals due to vibration, and are capable of having a greater air gap than passive stationary sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A drawback to the above mentioned systems is that while they can measure rotational velocity, they do not measure the direction of rotation. But, for rotational detection relating to vehicle wheels, direction detection is becoming important in addition to the common measurement of wheel rotational velocity. This need is arising due to improvements in existing as well as new features being proposed for vehicles, including anti-lock braking, traction control, vehicle stability control, electric park brake, electro-hydraulic braking, adaptive cruise control, integrated chassis control, and in-vehicle navigation. Furthermore, due to market pressures to reduce the cost of vehicles, such a system capable of detecting both rotational velocity and direction need to perform the functions required, in harsh environmental conditions, accurately and reliably, and yet for minimal additional cost. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In its embodiments, the present invention contemplates a rotational sensor system for detecting rotational velocity and rotational direction of a rotatable member rotatable in a forward and in a reverse rotational direction about an axis of rotation. The rotational sensor system includes a rotatable element adapted to operatively engage and rotate with the rotatable member about the axis of rotation, with the rotatable element having a generally circular periphery that includes means, spaced about the periphery, for creating magnetic field variations, first sensor means, adjacent to the periphery, for sensing variations in a magnetic field and producing an electric signal in response thereto, and second sensor means, adjacent to the periphery and circumferentially spaced about the periphery from said first sensor means, for sensing variations in a magnetic field and producing an electric signal in response thereto. The system also includes means for generating a magnetic field, means for receiving the electric signals from the first sensor means and second sensor means and detecting a phase shift between the signals from the first sensor means and the second sensor means, and means for generating an output signal indicative of rotational velocity and rotational direction of the rotatable element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention further contemplates a rotational sensor system for detecting rotational velocity and rotational direction of a rotatable member rotatable in a forward and in a reverse rotational direction about an axis of rotation. The rotational sensor system includes a rotatable element adapted to operatively engage and rotate with the rotatable member about the axis of rotation, with the rotatable element having a generally circular periphery that includes means, spaced about the periphery, for creating magnetic field variations, first sensor means, adjacent to the periphery, for sensing variations in a magnetic field and producing an electric signal in response thereto, and second sensor means, adjacent to the periphery and circumferentially spaced about the periphery from said first sensor means, for sensing variations in a magnetic field and producing an electric signal in response thereto. The system also includes means for generating a magnetic field, means for receiving the electric signals from the first sensor means and second sensor means and detecting a phase shift between the signals from the first sensor means and the second sensor means, and means for generating an output signal indicative of rotational velocity and rotational direction of the rotatable element. The system further includes means for generating an output signal including a series of square waves having frequencies corresponding to the rotational velocity of the rotatable element and having amplitudes that are in a first range when the rotatable element is rotating in the forward direction and in a second range when the rotatable element is rotating in the reverse direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a relatively simple rotation sensing system that can detect rotational velocity, including near zero and zero rotational velocity, as well as rotational direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Another object of the present invention is to provide a rotational velocity and direction sensing system with a simple and reliable signal for its output protocol. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the present invention is that more information about a rotating member is reliably provided by the sensing system while minimizing the complexity of the system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the present invention is that it is relatively simple, meets functional requirements for measuring rotational velocity, even down to zero velocity, as well as rotational direction, while operating fast and reliably in harsh vehicle environments.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> vehicle wheel speed sensor system is shown generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which detects the rotational velocity of a rotating member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as it rotates about its axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The axis of rotation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has a forward and a reverse direction of rotation, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Mounted to the member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and oriented to rotate about the axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with the member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, is a tone ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The tone ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is generally circular, made of a ferrous material, and includes a series of teeth <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> protruding from and spaced about its periphery <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The sensor system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also includes a sensor assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, which includes a first <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a second <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> Hall effect sensor. Both sensors are mounted adjacent to but spaced from the periphery <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and teeth <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The radial distance between the tone ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is called the air gap. The sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are oriented to project inwardly toward the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, with the second sensor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> spaced circumferentially about the periphery <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from the first sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Mounted adjacent to the sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and on the opposite side from the tone ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is a biasing magnet <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. This sensor assembly <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is thus a back biased configuration. The sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to an electronic control unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which receives the output from the sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Both sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are further electrically connected to a power supply (not shown) that supplies power to operate the sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, an alternate embodiment of the wheel speed sensor system <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is shown. In this embodiment, a magnetically encoded target wheel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, rather than a tone ring, is mounted to the rotating member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> about the axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. About the periphery <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the target wheel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is a series of alternately magnetically encoded teeth <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The two Hall sensors <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, of the sensor assembly <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, are mounted adjacent to and spaced from the teeth <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> of the target wheel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>. In this way, no magnet is needed to mount behind the two sensors <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. Thus, the sensor assembly <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is a non-back biased configuration. The output signals, however, produced by the sensors <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are essentially the same as with the back biased configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Again, the sensors <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1126</bold></highlight> are electrically connected to the electronic control unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> third embodiment of the present invention is shown. In this embodiment, wheel speed sensor system <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes a target wheel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, as is shown in the second embodiment, that is mounted to the rotating member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> about the axis of rotation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Two separate Hall effect sensors <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> are mounted a predetermined distance from the target wheel <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and from each other. The sensors <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> are each connected to an electronic control unit <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, which processes the output signal from each of the sensors <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>, as they relate to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the operation of the wheel speed sensor system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be described. Although the operation of this system is being described in reference to the first embodiment, it is equally applicable to either of the other two embodiments. Power is supplied to the sensors when it is desired to measure the rotational velocity and direction of the rotating member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As the member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> rotates, thus causing the teeth to pass by the Hall effect sensors <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the sensors detect the frequency of the changes in voltage of the magnetic field, and produce raw analog signals. An example of how these signals might look with the member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> rotating in the forward direction is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. A first analog signal <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is output from the first sensor <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and a second analog signal <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is output from the second sensor <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, with this second signal <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> being phase shifted from the first. This phase shift allows the direction of rotation to be determined. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the analog signal shows the first signal high threshold <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> occurring just prior to the second signal high threshold <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, and of course the same with the low thresholds. If the second signal high threshold occurs just prior to the first signal high threshold, then this would indicate a reverse rotational direction. Once these raw analog signals <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are received by the control unit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, they can then be processed to produce a rotational velocity and direction signal protocol that is easy to read, accurate and reliable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, an example of the protocol of the output signal will be discussed. The first two square waves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> shown fluctuate between a forward high amplitude <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and a forward low amplitude <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, indicative of forward rotation. The rotational velocity is based upon measuring the time between consecutive rising edges, or falling edges, of the square waves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The second two square waves <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> show an example of the signal for a reverse rotational direction. The reverse high amplitude <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and reverse low amplitude <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> values are both higher than the forward amplitudes <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, but preferably have the same difference in amplitude between the high and low values of the respective waves. Further, the reverse low amplitude <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is sufficiently higher than the forward high amplitude so that there is a dead band <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> between the amplitudes of the waves for the forward direction and that for the reverse direction. The direction of rotation is then based upon determining the amplitude for either the high <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> or the low <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> amplitudes of the square waves <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Error protection is provided by including the dead band <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> between the signal levels for the forward rotation and the signal levels for the reverse rotational direction. With these signals, then, both the rotational velocity and the direction of rotation can be easily and reliably determined. This protocol produces a simple and unique signal for determining rotational direction in addition to the rotational velocity. Rather than encode a direction indicator at the beginning of a signal, this protocol changes the amplitude of levels for the square waves that are used to measure the rotational velocity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the provisions of the patent statutes, the present invention has been described in what is considered to represent its preferred embodiment. However, it should be noted that the invention can be practiced otherwise than as specifically illustrated and described without departing from its spirit or scope. For example, the present invention could be utilized in numerous types of rotating equipment and, therefore, is not limited solely to applications in motor vehicles. </paragraph>
