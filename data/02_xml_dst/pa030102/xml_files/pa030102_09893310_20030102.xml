<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a commercial convection oven having an easily tuneable high pressure airflow pattern. The convection oven has a duct with nozzles that extend into a cooking chamber. Each nozzle is positionable between an open position and a closed position in order to tune the airflow pattern within the cooking chamber while maintaining a desired static pressure within the duct. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Conventional commercial convection ovens have one or more fans which circulate the air within the oven cavity. The airflow within the oven cavity is highly turbulent but characterized by a circulation pattern evident in the oven&apos;s baking performance. A distinct and often undesirable pattern is seen on the cooked food product. In areas of the oven cavity where the airflow is too low, the food product will be raw or uncooked. Conversely, in areas where the airflow is too high, the food product will be burned or overcooked. In such situations, it is desirable to tune the convection oven so that a uniform airflow is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Many conventional commercial convection ovens having low pressure systems are tuned by attempting to produce a single flow pattern having a uniform flow and temperature distribution within the oven cavity. However, the tuning of conventional convection ovens is difficult, and often a trial and error process, for several reasons. First, convection ovens are used to cook different types and quantities of food products having a variety of sizes, shapes and cooking requirements. Second, the airflow pattern within the oven cavity is highly unpredictable because the energy is stored in the form of velocity rather than pressure. Third, air may not flow through the oven cavity in a uniform pattern depending on the direction and magnitude of the surrounding flow. Accurately tuning a conventional convection oven with a low pressure system is extremely difficult for these reasons. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is apparent that there is a need for a convection oven with a tuneable airflow pattern within the oven cavity to provide a uniform airflow pattern for an even cooking process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is also apparent that there is a need for a convection oven wherein the energy is stored in the form of pressure rather than velocity to provide a predictable airflow pattern. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention to provide a duct distribution system to produce a high pressure airflow within a cooking chamber of a convection oven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is another object of this invention to provide a high pressure airflow that is easily tuneable to a predictable direction and defined pattern to provide a uniform airflow within a cooking chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The above objects and other objects of this invention are accomplished with a duct distribution system for a convection oven having a blower plenum, positioned adjacent and in communication with a cooking chamber, and a duct. In preferred embodiments of this invention, a high pressure convection blower produces a high pressure airflow at about 800 cubic feet per minute (&ldquo;cfm&rdquo;) at about 2 inches to about 3 inches of static pressure. For other convection ovens having a cooking chamber with a different volume, the high pressure airflow may vary accordingly. For example, the high pressure airflow may range from about 400 cfm to about 1600 cfm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The duct is connected to the blower plenum and in communication with the cooking chamber. In the preferred embodiments of this invention, the duct extends along at least a portion of the outer back wall and/or a side wall of the convection oven. Preferably, at least a portion of the duct has a plurality of nozzles extending into the cooking chamber. Each nozzle is moveable between an open position and a closed position to tune the airflow pattern within the cooking chamber. In other preferred embodiments of this invention, a plurality of apertures, for example slots, are positioned on at least a portion of the duct. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the static pressure within the duct is at least 0.5 inch H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O or at least about 250%, preferably at least about 300% of a theoretical dynamic pressure. The relatively high level of static pressure in the duct allows the airflow though the nozzles into the cooking chamber to be precisely tuned to a definite airflow pattern. Tuning the airflow according to this invention involves closing the nozzles in areas where the airflow into the cooking chamber is too high, and opening the nozzles in areas where the airflow into the cooking chamber is too low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one preferred embodiment of this invention, an inlet baffle is positioned between the cooking chamber and the blower plenum. The inlet baffle has a plurality of apertures to provide communication between the cooking chamber and the blower plenum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The high pressure airflow and duct distribution system in accordance with this invention can be used in any type of convection oven including, but not limited to, gas-fired convection ovens and electrically-fired convection ovens. Further, the gas-fired convection ovens may use a direct-fired combustion system and/or an indirect-fired combustion system having a heat exchanger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The convection oven further comprises a gas combustion system mounted with respect to the blower plenum to produce or generate combustion products. In preferred embodiments of this invention, the combustion products move into a heat exchange element comprising a plurality of heat exchange tubes. The heat exchange tubes are mounted within the blower plenum and with respect to the high pressure blower. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As the combustion products move through each heat exchange tube, heat is transferred from within the heat exchange tube to a volume of the blower plenum by conduction. Further, the high pressure blower produces a high pressure airflow across the heat exchange tubes to transfer heat from the heat exchange tubes to the high pressure airflow through convection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The combustion products collect in a header which is connected to an inducer having an inducer fan that draws or induces the combustion products into the inducer. The inducer has a valve which is moveable between an open position and a closed position. In the open position, the combustion products move through the inducer to ambient air through a vent connected to the inducer. Thus, the combustion products do not enter the duct and the convection oven operates as an indirect-fired combustion system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the closed position, the combustion products are in communication with the cooking chamber. Thus, the convection oven operates as a direct-fired combustion system and the combustion products directly contact the food product in the cooking chamber during the cooking process.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Convection oven <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, may be any type of convection oven including, but not limited to, a gas-fired convection oven or an electrically-fired convection oven. Further, the gas-fired convection oven may use a direct-fired combustion system and/or an indirect-fired combustion system having a heat exchanger. Preferably, but not necessarily, convection oven <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is a commercial convection oven having a combustion system switchable between a direct-fired combustion system and an indirect-fired combustion system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Convection oven <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> comprises a cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Preferably, cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has at least one rack for supporting a food product during the cooking process. Cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can have dimensions to accommodate any type, quantity and/or size of food product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> blower plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is positioned adjacent and in communication with cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A convection blower <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is mounted within blower plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In other preferred embodiments of this invention, a second convection blower is mounted within blower plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In one preferred embodiment of this invention, convection blower <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is a high pressure convection blower having backward inclined fans to produce an airflow of about 800 cubic feet per minute (&ldquo;cfm&rdquo;) at about 2 inches to about 3 inches of static pressure. It is apparent that convection blower <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may have any suitable fan configuration known to those having ordinary skill in the art. In another preferred embodiment of this invention, wherein convection oven <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a different volume, the high pressure airflow may vary accordingly. For example, the high pressure airflow may range from about 400 cfm to about 1600 cfm. High pressure blower <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is driven by a motor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight>. In one preferred embodiment of this invention, motor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> has about &frac18; horsepower (&ldquo;hp&rdquo;) to about 1 hp, preferably about &frac34; hp. It is apparent to those skilled in the art that any reversible motor with suitable hp may be used. It is also apparent to those skilled in the art that other means may be used to drive high pressure blower <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to produce the required airflow for this invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is connected to blower plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and in communication with cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. In one preferred embodiment of this invention, duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> extends along at least a portion of the back wall <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and/or a side wall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of convection oven <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Preferably, a plurality of nozzles <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> extend from at least a portion of an inner wall of duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> into cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. In another preferred embodiment of this invention, a plurality of apertures, for example slots, are positioned on at least a portion of duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so that duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in communication with cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Nozzles <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are moveable between an open position and a closed position to tune the airflow pattern within cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In order to maintain the desired static pressure or back pressure within duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, the total area of openings in duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, i.e. the number of nozzles <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the open position, should remain constant throughout the tuning process. Thus, the relative static pressure within duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> remains high to properly control the airflow pattern into cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In one preferred embodiment of this invention, nozzles <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> are arranged along duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a vertical orientation to correspond with the racks within cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, allowing the airflow through nozzles <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to properly contact the food product. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the static pressure within duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is at least 0.5 inch H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O or at least about 250%, preferably at least about 300% of a theoretical dynamic pressure. The theoretical dynamic pressure is calculated as the product of the cross-sectional area of duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the airflow rate through duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Energy stored as static pressure is converted to velocity energy when air flows through nozzles <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> into cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The relatively high level of static pressure in duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> allows the airflow though nozzles <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> into cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to be precisely tuned to a definite airflow pattern. Tuning the airflow according to this invention involves closing nozzles <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in areas where the airflow into cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is too high, resulting in areas of food product that are overcooked, and opening nozzles <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in areas where the airflow into cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is too low, resulting in areas of the food product that are undercooked. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In one preferred embodiment of this invention, an inlet baffle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is positioned between cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and blower plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Inlet baffle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> to provide communication between cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and blower plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Preferably, but not necessarily, inlet baffle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has at least one air return <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>) that corresponds with the positioning of high pressure convection blower <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> within blower plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In other preferred embodiments of this invention, blower plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has at least one air return <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, convection oven <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> may be any type of convection oven including, but not limited to, a gas-fired convection oven or an electrically-fired convection oven. In one preferred embodiment of this invention, convection oven <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> further comprises a gas combustion system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> mounted with respect to blower plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. Gas combustion system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> produces or generates combustion products. The term &ldquo;combustion products&rdquo; as used throughout this specification and in the claims includes, but is not limited to, heat and combustion gas fumes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Gas combustion system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> comprises a gas manifold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having at least one gas outlet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, preferably at least three gas outlets <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. A gas supply <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> supplies gas, for example natural gas, to gas manifold <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, a burner <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is attached to each gas outlet <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. As gas is distributed through gas outlets <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and into burners <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the gas burns or combusts to generate combustion products. The combustion products move into a heat exchange element <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> connected to each burner <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Heat exchange element <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is mounted within blower plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and with respect to high pressure blower <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Preferably, heat exchange element <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is mounted adjacent high pressure blower <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> within blower plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In the preferred embodiments according to this invention, heat exchange element <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> comprises a plurality of heat exchange tubes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. Preferably, each heat exchange tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has an outer diameter of about 0.75 inch. At least one heat exchange tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is preferably connected to each burner <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of gas combustion system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. As the combustion products move through each heat exchange tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, heat is transferred from within heat exchange tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to a volume of blower plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by conduction through heat exchange tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Further, high pressure blower <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> produces a high pressure airflow across heat exchange tubes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to transfer heat from heat exchange tubes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the high pressure airflow through convection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Heat exchange tubes <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are connected to a header <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Header <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is mounted within blower plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and in communication with gas combustion system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The combustion products are collected from each heat exchange tube <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in a volume of header <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and are drawn into an inducer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> connected to header <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A valve (not shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>), positioned within inducer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, is moveable between an open position and a closed position. In the open position, the combustion products induced into inducer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are in communication with the ambient air through a vent <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> connected to inducer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Thus, the combustion products do not enter duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and convection oven <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> operates as an indirect-fired combustion system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In the closed position, the combustion products induced into inducer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are in communication with cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Thus, convection oven <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> operates as a direct-fired combustion system. In a direct-fired combustion system, the combustion products directly contact the food product in cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> during the cooking process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, high pressure convection blower <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> pressurizes the air within the distribution duct system which comprises duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and blower plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. High pressure convection blower <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> generates a high pressure airflow across heat exchange element <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Heat is transferred from heat exchange element <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to the air flowing through blower plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by conduction and convection. The heated air is forced into duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The air within duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is pressurized to a static pressure of at least 0.5 inch H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O, preferably at least 1.0 inch H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O. The specific magnitude of static pressure within duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> determines the jet velocity of airflow leaving nozzles <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Too much static pressure within duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> results in airflow with a high velocity that will overcook or burn the food products in cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Low static pressure within duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> results in a weak airflow through cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and slow cook times. Further, the relatively high level of static pressure compared to the velocity pressure produces airflow through nozzles <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> having a predictable direction and amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> The airflow forced through nozzles <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> by the back pressure in duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is adjusted or tuned to create a very precise and defined airflow pattern within cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The tuning process of airflow through cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> consists of closing nozzles <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> corresponding to areas or portions of the food product which appear overcooked and opening nozzles <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> corresponding to areas or portions of the food products which appear undercooked. The number of nozzles <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the open position after the tuning process should equal the number of nozzles <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> in the open position before the tuning process in order to maintain the desired static pressure within duct <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The air is forced out of cooking chamber <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> through the plurality of apertures <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> in inlet baffle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by high pressure convection blower <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Preferably, high pressure blower <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> induces the air into blower plenum <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through air return <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> where the air is forced across heat exchange element <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and recirculated through the duct distribution system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> While in the foregoing specification this invention has been described in relation to certain preferred embodiments, and many details are set forth for purpose of illustration, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that this invention is susceptible to additional embodiments and that certain of the details described in this specification and in the claims can be varied considerably without departing from the basic principles of this invention. </paragraph>
