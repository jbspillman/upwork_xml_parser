<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for automatically calibrating gas sensors. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Gas detectors protect life and property. In an industrial setting, gas detectors typically use remote sensors so that the presence of any hazardous gas, flammable, or toxic, may quickly be detected at a remote location of a facility or process. The presence of a hazardous gas is reported to a control room. The concentration of the gas is typically analyzed by computer, and alarms are automatically activated when the concentration of the gas exceeds certain preset values. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A major problem in any detection and alarm system is reliability. For the detection and alarm system to be safe, the operator must frequently check and calibrate each sensor. Calibration must be done quite frequently in order to insure the accuracy of the sensors. A large number of sensors are typically installed on a fixed gas detection site, so that calibration is an ongoing, time consuming process. Because sensors for a number of hazardous gases which are lighter than air, such as methane, hydrogen, etc. are sited high above the floor or ground, e.g., beneath the roofs of garages, inside skylights, inside silos, etc., applying calibration gas to these sensors to adjust the scaling can be hazardous to maintenance personnel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> One method for reducing the time, effort, and risk of calibrating sensors, which is usually performed monthly, was by &ldquo;remote calibration&rdquo;, or &ldquo;rem-cal.&rdquo; This entailed installing long &frac18; inch internal diameter tubes for delivering calibration gas directly to each sensor, using an adapter to direct the gas into the sensing head. Plastic tubing from each sensor led down to conveniently located calibration stations, usually mounted at eye level adjacent to the monitoring box. This type of monitoring box is described in Ketler, U.S. Pat. No. 66,169,488, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. This monitoring box is also referred to as a Dxcalibar box. As many as 16 tubes, connecting to as many sensors, are organized into a terminal bracket such that each tube was labeled as to the particular sensor it served. Each tube also had its own hose barb adapter for easily applying gas from portable zero and span gas tanks to any selected sensor, via a flexible hose leading to a gas tank which is the source of the zero and span calibration gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The old style calibration process comprised applying zero gas (air) for about two minutes. The gas application time varied, depending upon the length of tubing, i.e., separation, between the sensor and the rem-cal station. The gas flowed through the tubing toward the sensors at about 100 feet per minute. A multimeter was used to monitor the analog electrical signal from the sensor, which was accessible inside the attending Dxcalibar box. When the zero setting became visibly stable, i.e., not changing with time, the technician adjusted the zero potentiometer on the remote calibration circuitry, also within the Dxcalibar box, so that the precise zero signal level, normally 4.00 ma, was viewed on a hand-held multi-meter. The zero gas was then turned off by a hand valve and then span (upscale) gas from the adjacent tank was applied for two minutes. Again, when the sensor stabilized at the high level condition, the span adjustment potentiometer was adjusted so that the signal read the proper gas concentration (e.g., 25 ppm carbon monoxide) as designated by the calibration certificate supplied with the calibration gas tank, presumably with accuracy traceable to the National Bureau of Standards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Remote calibration, using tubes to route calibration gas to sensors offered major benefits in reduced time for calibration and safer working conditions for personnel. However, this process still required the use of a trained technician, and there was the possibility of errors occurring if the timing were cut short by a careless technician or if the meter readings and adjustments were imprecise. Indeed, if the pot adjustments were made prematurely, i.e., before the sensor signal stabilized, the result could be an improperly adjusted, inaccurate, sensor, which could note be relied upon to detect life threatening gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Traditionally, assuming 15 minutes of labor for manually calibrating only one sensor, a facility with 100 sensors could spend 300 worker-hours or more each year for monthly calibrations. Moreover, since sensors are usually sited in hard to reach places, the tedious and risky lifts and ladders needed to approach sensors for calibration are avoided, thus eliminating a safety hazard. Additionally, often vehicles or stored materials must be moved to gain physical access to the sensors. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the present invention to overcome the aforesaid deficiencies in the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a method for automatically calibrating gas sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, two calibration gas tanks, one for zero gas and one for span gas, are sited adjacent to each remote calibration tube termination station. Calibration gas is automatically controlled using two computer controlled solenoid valves. The computer monitors the sensors and controls the on/off states of the two (zero and span gas) solenoid valves through existing conventional telemetry. The computer also makes all needed corrections and adjustments, all without human intervention. The extra cost of the dedicated gas tanks and solenoid control panel is quickly offset by the saving in human labor and, more importantly, by the extra safety afforded by eliminating human errors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The sensors monitored by the system of the present invention need not all be of one type. For a mix of sensors, e.g., CO, CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and CH<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, one set of tanks can be custom mixed to cover all three sensor types. Multiple calibration runs are programmed to cover all sensor types. The system of the present invention is capable or calibrating virtually any sensor array, whether in a cluster or strung out linearly, such as in a tunnel. Automatic calibration of tunnel sensors is particularly useful because of the inconvenience and high cost of diverting traffic while calibrating manually.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> AutoCal Description and Operation </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The gas sensor calibration of the present invention, AutoCal (or &ldquo;AC&rdquo;), is controlled by AutoCal/SW software (or &ldquo;AC/SW&rdquo;,) a software program which runs on a PC under Windows-95, -98, -2000 or -NT. It operates in conjunction with Millennia-DX (or &ldquo;M-DX&rdquo;), a monitoring and control software package developed by Rel-Tek for data acquisition and alarm generation product programs used mainly in the mining and transit industries. AC/SW and M-DX &ldquo;talk&rdquo; back and forth, with AC/SW directing the AC procedure, while M-DX logs all data and communicates with the remote AC panel which interfaces with the cal-gas tanks and sensors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> AC/SW runs as a background task behind M-DX, timing its auto-calibration (or &ldquo;ac&rdquo;) event scheduling based on the PC&apos;s software calendar and clock. When calibration time is at hand, the AC/SW sends a message to M-DX&mdash;which is monitoring a large number of gas sensor signals for alarm conditions&mdash;to disable all alarms for all sensors connected to the AC panel which are to be calibrated. The AC/SW communicates to the AC panel at the field location near the sensors over a telemetry link to open the SPAN-gas solenoid valve. A pressure transducer at the remote panel monitors the gas pressure supply, the status of which is continuously telemetered to the computer. If the calibration gas pressure drops below a preset threshold, the AC/SW aborts the ac procedure and prints a message on the computer screen to notify the operator. If the pressure is sufficiently high, indicating ample gas supply, the ac procedure continues, with the upscale span calibration gas (usually a gas concentration of 50% of the full scale range of the sensor) flowing through the manifold of flow restricting orifices , then through the connected tubing, arriving at each sensor, and then entering each sensor&apos;s gas detection module. Following a timed duration, or whenever the farthest sensors are determined by the computer to have stabilized at the span calibration gas value, the computer sets the new span value in its digital calibration data bank to precisely the value of the span calibration gas concentration, usually within 12-bit resolution (i.e. &plus;/&minus;0.024% of the sensor range.) The computer then issues control commands to the AC panel to shut off the span solenoid and open the ZERO-gas solenoid valve. Again the gas pressure is verified to be sufficient, before progressing. The ZERO-gas (i.e. gas having no upscale component) flows through the manifold of orifices and tubing, pushing ahead of it any SPAN-gas remaining in the tubing, and finally arriving at the sensor. After a timed period, or whenever the zero level is determined to be stable, the computer proceeds to set the zero values in its digital data bank to the same 12-bit resolution. Should the calibration gas pressure fall below the preset minimum during any portion of the forgoing procedure, the entire AC event is aborted, a failure report is generated, and sensors are returned to their pre-test status. To terminate the AC procedure, the AC/SW notifies the M-DX to send a command to the AC panel to shut off the ZERO-gas solenoid valve. The computer then returns the newly calibrated sensors to their normal operational status, and the alarming functions are reactivated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The computer generates a final report stating the results of the auto-calibration event, including the time and date, the span and zero values for each sensor before and after gases were applied, and listing any sensors which tested badly (i.e, which did . not demonstrate the expected movement between span and zero, or which were unstable.) Failed sensors are automatically disabled (i.e. removed from gas alarming service) and are flagged in the final report for special maintenance attention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A real time graphical display of the progress of the AC procedure is available in M-DX software graphics. This depicts the values and trends of up to 16 sensors at a time, indicating the transient changes and stabilization of each sensor for viewing by management. Graphs may be printed out for hard copy reference. Also, the AC test data of all sensors is logged to hard drive throughout the procedure, so this historical information is available for offline viewing and printout. An 8-sensor auto-calibration graphic is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. This depicts eight purposely decalibrated sensors, tracking through a complete AC procedure&mdash;SPAN followed by ZERO gas delivery and computer adjustments. An immediate rerun&mdash;not part of the AC procedure&mdash;is shown to prove the calibration effectiveness of the forgoing AC procedure, wherein all eight previously processed sensors reach precisely the same SPAN and ZERO levels, albeit through differing transient paths, and thus requiring no further adjustments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> It is important that the span testing be done first, followed by the zero testing; as it is better to leave the gas supply tubing filled with ZERO-gas after test than with upscale SPAN-gas, the latter requiring purging, thus a second and wasteful usage of ZERO-gas. Performing span testing first and zero testing last leaves the tubing nicely purged with ZERO-gas at the end of the test. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Timed periods for each gas component flow (whether 8, 16 or more sensors are involved) is typically 10 minutes, although this depends on the length of cal-gas delivery tubing involved (approximately 100 ft per minute flow rate) and the response speed of the sensor under test. A complete AC procedure with 200 ft sensor ranges can take about 20 minutes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> AC scheduling can be flexibly programmed to occur at virtually any time of calendar day, see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Multiple groups can be identified to be processed at different times. Pressure threshold can be entered, as well as the gas flow time and gas concentration parameters. In the event the user wishes to run an immediate recalibration&mdash;as following sensor replacement or an alarm incident&mdash;the &ldquo;Cal Now&rdquo; button can be selected which will start the AC procedure immediately. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The gas sensor calibration system of the present invention uses off the shelf software designed for gas calibration to control the entire calibration process. The software automatically turns calibration gas on and off to groups of sensors at predetermined intervals. The adjustments are then made at the computer, not at the sensor. If the sensor cannot be calibrated, the system alerts the user to permit further investigation of the cause of the problem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In a typical arrangement, such as a bus maintenance facility, 32 carbon monoxide sensors are sited throughout the facility and electrically monitored in a conventional manner. Two 16 channel Dxcalibar boxes and two 16-channel AutoCal control stations, complete with calibration gas tanks, tubing, and a PC running the software are also provided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> When the automatic calibration system of the present invention is run, the computer temporarily disconnects the sensors form the alarms and plant controls and then precisely orchestrates the admission of zero and span calibration gas to individual sensors or to groups of sensors. Calibration gas stored in two pressure tanks and controlled by solenoid vales is directed through tubing leading form the safe ground level calibration station to the sensors, which can be up to or more than about 150 feet away in hazardous locations. Digital communication with the computer assures proper flow and calibration adjustments, and then generates full documentation for records. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The system of the present invention provides automatic scheduling and documentation, which saves time and effort while providing the information needed. Each sensor is regularly tested for proper operation, providing confidence that the gas detection system is operating properly. Bad sensors are identified and reported. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The Figures show a typical AutoCal equipment arrangement, but these examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not mean to be limiting. Sensors are not shown in the Figures, but are sited throughout the facility. A calibration gas tube is connected to each sensor using a permanently installed adapter fitting which directs any calibration gas flowing through the tube directly into the sensing head of the sensor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference> illustrate a stationary version of the automatic calibration system of the present invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</cross-reference> is the right hand version and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</cross-reference> is the left hand version. Two calibration gas tanks, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, for zero gas and span gas, respectively are secured to a wall. Hoses, <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, connect the tanks to solenoid valves, S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. In this illustration, the zero gas tank is connected to valve S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and the span gas tank is connected to valve S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Zero gas and span gas are fed through the solenoid valves to a plurality of hose barb manifolds <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> for delivering calibration gas to each sensor. A compression clamp <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is provided to clamp the gas delivery tubing <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> to the hose barb manifold <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows the arrangement of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in greater detail. A pressure sensor <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> senses pressure in the calibration gases from the solenoid valves S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to the hose barb manifolds <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. This pressure sensor is preferably equipped with an LED or other device that indicates when the pressure sensor is operational. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the display <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can include a mixture of several types of sensors in the groups. In this illustration, CO&equals;carbon monoxide, and GB&equals;methane. Other types of hazardous gases, of course, can be monitored by this system. While the Figure shows two groups, any number of groups can be used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Section <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> identifies the calibration gas concentration. The pressure check <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> defines the pressure test and level for aborting. The pressure sensor <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> identifies the particular gas to be used in the pressure test. The measurement delay <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> shows the time lapse for zero and span gas flow. The minimum range <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> shows the minimum sensor movement to zero. Any day of the week can be chosen for the test to be run, as shown at <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, as well as the week of the month <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The alarm control display <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> defines whether an error message is to be displayed on the screen if a failure occurs. A silent audio alarm <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is provided for notification of a failures; this can play a warning signal over a loudspeaker.

<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a portable automatic calibration system wherein the gas tanks, <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, are installed on a cart with wheels <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> so that the tanks can be wheeled to any desired location. Hoses <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, connect the span gas tank <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> and the zero gas tank <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to a gas control panel <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. Low pressure calibration gas is fed through tube <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to a manifold adapter <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> containing hose barb manifolds, <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Tubing <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> carries the calibration gas to remotely located sensors. Power and control come from a Dxcalibar box <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> to the gas control panel <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A companion computer program in the central monitoring PC contains software for implementing and documenting the Automatic Calibration (Auto Cal) procedure. On a scheduled time and date, the computer invokes the auto cal procedure, logically disconnecting the alarm functions for the sensors, and commencing by introducing span gas into the sensor calibration tubing manifold. The software provides for a prescribed waiting time, generally on the order of two to three minutes, for the gas to travel the 100 feet or so to each sensor, and for the sensors to register the span gas value in a stable fashion. The computer then detects the raw digital value being transmitted to each sensor and assigns the calibrated values to the proper sensor configuration registers. After a time out period, the computer then terminates the span gas flow and opens the zero gas flow into the manifold. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> There is another prescribed wait time for the zero gas to traverse the distance and register on the sensor. After that the computer assigns the calibrated zero values to the sensor registers and turns off the calibration gas flow, thus completing the calibration process. Once the calibration process is completed, the PC documents the time and date of calibration, along with any unusual changes or problems that were detected, in a calibration report. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The hose barbs on the calibration gas manifold contain flow restrictions, which is essential to provide equal flow over all 16 tubes. Without these flow restrictions, a tube with the least flow resistance will receive excess calibration gas, while a tube with a higher flow resistance will receive less gas flow. Since the gas flow and sensor output stabilizing time period is identical for all sensors, the sensor having the least flow may be inadequately stabilized at the end time when the sensor signal values are accepted. This would result in inaccurate calibration and possibly create an unsafe condition. Alternatively, the time period would have to be extended to provide sufficient stabilization time for the slowest, or highest resistance, path. This problem is solved by the present invention by providing passive, constant flow orifices in each path, such that the variable portion of the resistance, i.e., sensor to sensor, would be an insignificant variation when the constant resistance and variable resistance are combined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an inexpensive way of implementing flow resistance inexpensively. Each hose barb on the flow manifold has a blockage with a tiny capillary hole (e.g., about 0.010 inch in diameter) installed. Several methods can be used to implement this capillary blockage, including potting shut and drilling. The preferred method is to embed a 0.010 inch diameter wire in a drop of epoxy or other similar material placed in the barb fitting. The fitting is held with the thin, open end downward, and the liquid resin forms a bubble at the low opening of the barb, The protruding portion of the wire and resin bubble are ground off, and then the wire is extracted, leaving behind a precise capillary orifice of the 0.010 inch wire diameter. This technique can be used for T barbs as well as straight through barbs, although installing the wire with a right angle pull through is somewhat tedious. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> The backpressure created by the capillary hose barb, when wall mounted in a 16 barb wide manifold, created and maintained a near equal and constant flow of calibration gas to each of the 16 sensors when calibrated simultaneously. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates the hose barb fittings and how they are prepared. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows a standard, off the shelf hose barb fitting. The barb fitting can be made of any suitable material, such as brass, plastic, or the like. To prepare the capillary hole in the barb, one or two drops of liquid resin, such as epoxy, are placed into the top of the barb. Any excess resin drips though the barb, leaving a bubble <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> at the bottom. A wire <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having the desired dimensions of the capillary hole is immediately placed through the barb and the bubble. The wire can be made of any relatively rigid material, such as iron, copper, and the like. A thin film of lubricant is preferably applied to the wire to prevent its sticking to the resin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> After the resin has hardened, the epoxy bubble and external wire are ground flush, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</cross-reference>. The wire is extracted as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>D, leaving a hole having a consistent capillary length and diameter <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. Filter material <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is preferably inserted into the barb housing to prevent dust from entering and plugging the capillary hole, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates 16 calibrating gas tubes <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> made of plastic or other suitable material. In this illustration, the tubes are approximately &frac34; inch long with an internal diameter of &frac18; inch. Of course, the size of the tubing is not crucial to the present invention and is provided merely by way of illustration. A pneumatic plug <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> leads to the supply of calibration gas. Each calibration gas tube <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> is equipped with a T barb fitting <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> with a capillary hole in the center barb opening. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> These T barb fittings can be conventionally available T barb fittings which have been provided with a capillary hole in the center barb opening. FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>F illustrate one embodiment for forming a capillary opening in a T barb. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A, a</cross-reference> looped wire <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is inserted into a side opening of the T barb <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> shows inserting a &ldquo;J&rdquo; hooked wire into the center opening of the T barb <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> as far as possible. The looped wire catches the &ldquo;J&rdquo; hook as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>C, and the looped wire and &ldquo;J&rdquo; hooked wire are extracted to that they both exit the side opening of the T barb <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight>. The central part of the T barb containing the wire is then dipped into a liquid resin such as epoxy and the resin drained, leaving a bubble of resin <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The external bubble is ground off to form a T-barb as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>E, The wire is then extracted, leaving a capillary hole <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> in the resin. </paragraph>

In this illustration, there are <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> hose barbs <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> for 16 sensor tubes. </paragraph>

The gases pass through computer controlled solenoid valves <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, through a pressure verification <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>, and then through a gas supply manifold <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> fitted with 16 hose barbs. Semi-rigid plastic tubes <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> carry the gas to each of 16 sensors <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Automatic calibration eliminates the costly technical labor and the inevitable human errors of manual calibration, wherein the sensors may not be fully stabilized when calibration adjustments are made, and where sensor adjustments can be anything but precise. Or, as frequently occurs, troublesome false alarms are activated during calibration, because the calibrating personnel failed to disable them properly prior to starting the tests. Automatic calibration takes care of all these eventualities without human concern. Using gas delivery tubing to each sensor eliminates the risk of sending personnel to the remote sensor locations which may be high overhead , inside a silo, above moving conveyors, or the like. AC can be scheduled for weekend and night hours (unfavorable for personnel) to avoid having to disable essential gas alarming functions during critical production times. AC performs automatically, so there is never a missed calibration event&mdash;and attending fines&mdash;where federal/state safety or environmental codes are involved. AC provides reliable documentation of the AC results as a verification of sensor conditions and calibration parameters encountered for archival records which can be made available for inspection if ever needed. AC uses large tanks of calibration gas, typically sufficient for a year of monthly or even weekly calibrations, thus avoiding the inconvenient depletion and frequent reordering of costlier, portable tanks used for manual calibration. The initial cost of AC is incidental compared with the savings in labor and other costs associated with manual calibration, usually paying back its investment in less than a year&apos;s time. </paragraph>
