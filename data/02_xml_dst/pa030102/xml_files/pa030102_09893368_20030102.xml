<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to center beam rail road cars and to lading securement apparatus for those rail road cars. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Center beam rail road cars, in cross-section, generally have a body having a flat car deck and a center beam web structure running along the longitudinal center-line of, and standing upright from, the deck. The center beam structure is carried on a pair of rail car trucks. The rack, or center beam structure, has a pair of bulkheads at either longitudinal end. The bulkheads extend transversely relative to the rolling direction of the car. The lading supporting structure of the body includes laterally extending deck sheets or bunks mounted above, and spanning the space between, the trucks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The center beam web structure is typically in the nature of an open frame truss for carrying vertical shear and bending loads. It stands upright from the deck and runs along the longitudinal centerline of the car between the end bulkheads. This kind of webwork structure can be constructed from an array of parallel uprights and appropriate diagonal bracing. Typically, a center sill extends the length of the car, and the posts extend upwardly from the center sill. Most often, a top truss assembly is mounted on top of the vertical web and extends laterally to either side of the centerline of the car. The top truss is part of an upper beam assembly, (that is, the upper or top flange end of the center beam) and is usually manufactured as a wide flange, or wide flange-simulating truss, both to co-operate with the center sill to resist vertical bending, and also to resist transverse bending due to lateral horizontal loading of the car while travelling on a curve. The center beam thus formed is conceptually a deep girder beam whose bottom flange is the center sill, and whose top flange is the top truss (or analogous structure) of the car. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Center beam cars are commonly used to transport packaged bundles of lumber, although other loads such as pipe, steel, engineered wood products, or other goods can also be carried. The space above the decking and below the lateral wings of the top truss on each side of the vertical web of the center beam forms left and right bunks upon which bundles of wood can be loaded. The base of the bunk often includes risers that are mounted to slant inward, and the vertical web of the center beam is generally tapered from bottom to top, such that when the bundles are stacked, the overall stack leans inward toward the longitudinal centerline of the car. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Lading is most typically secured in place using straps or cables. Generally, the straps extend from a winch device mounted at deck level, upward outside the bundles, to a top fitting. The top fitting can be located at one of several intermediate heights for partially loaded cars. Most typically, the cars are fully loaded and the strap terminates at a fitting mounted to the outboard wing of the upper beam assembly. Inasmuch as the upper beam assembly is narrower than the bundles, when the strap is drawn taut by tightening the winch, it binds on the upper outer comer of the topmost bundle and exerts a force inwardly and downwardly, tending thereby to hold the stack in place tight against the center beam web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Each bundle typically contains a number of pieces of lumber, commonly the nominal 2&Prime;&times;4&Prime;, 2&Prime;&times;6&Prime;, 2&Prime;&times;8&Prime; or other standard size. The lengths of the bundles vary, typically ranging from 8&prime; to 24&prime;, in 2&prime; increments. The most common bundle size is nominally 32 inches deep by 49 inches wide, although 24 inch deep bundles are also used, and 16 inch deep bundles can be used, although these latter are generally less common. A 32 inch nominal bundle may contain stacks of 21 boards, each 1-&frac12; inch thick, making 31-&frac12; inches, and may include a further 1-&frac12; inches of dunnage for a total of 33 inches. The bundles are loaded such that the longitudinal axes of the boards are parallel to the longitudinal, or rolling, axis of the car generally. The bundles are often wrapped in a plastic sheeting to provide some protection from rain and snow, and also to discourage embedment of abrasive materials such as sand, in the boards. The bundles are stacked on the car bunks with the dunnage located between the bundles such that a fork-lift can be used for loading and unloading. For bundles of kiln dried softwood lumber the loading density is typically taken as being in the range of 1600 to 2000 Lbs. per 1000 board-feet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Existing center beam cars tend to have been made to fall within the car design envelope, or outline, of the American Association of Railroads standard AAR Plate C, and tend to have a flat main deck that runs at the level of the top of the main bolsters at either end of the car. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,951,575, of Dominguez et al., issued Aug. 28, 1990, a center beam car is shown that falls within the design envelope of plate C, and also has a depressed center deck between the car trucks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In center beam cars having a top truss with cantilevered truss wings extending transversely outboard from the top chord, the typical method of securing the lading, namely the bundles of lumber, in place is to fasten an array of cables, or webs, to the outboard wings of the top truss, to run the cable or web outboard about the lading, and then to anchor each cable, or web at deck level using a winch device. The winches and cables (or webs) are usually spaced along the car on pitches corresponding to the longitudinal pitch between the various upright posts of the center beam, typically on about 4 ft centers. If the car is not fully laden, the cables, or webs, can typically be hooked to attachment fittings at lower heights on the center beam posts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In some types of center beam cars, and in some types of bulkhead flat cars that do not have center beams, or center partitions, the cables or webs have one end anchored on one side of the deck, and the web or cable is thrown clear over the lading to the other side of the car, and then a winch on the other side of the car is used to tighten the cable or web in place at the given longitudinal station. In some cases a spacer, or load spreader bracket is placed between the cable and the lading at the outer top comer of the lading where the cable by itself might otherwise dig into the lading when tightened. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present inventors prefer webs as opposed to cables, such as were formerly more commonly used. The webs tend to be made of woven nylon (t.m.) or polyester, or PVC, and can be obtained, typically in <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> inch wide bands, although other widths are available. Typically the winch device has a spindle with a gear on one end that co-operates with a pawl. The spindle has a central slot through which the web can be wrapped, and then a bar is fed into an eye at the end of the spindle, and the end of the web is spooled up until tight. The pawl discourages the gear from turning in the loosening direction. &frac34; drives are also used to tighten the web. The square for the &frac34; drive can also be in the spindle, near the eye. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It has been suggested that these webs can withstand significant tensile loads, possibly as much as 20,000 lbs. in tension. The webs tend to be portable, and moderately expensive to replace. As such, they are quite attractive to thieves since a web band of this nature can be put to many household, cottage, or other uses not necessarily intended by the rail car manufacturer or operator. The webs are all the more attractive for unintended purposes if they are particularly long, as is the case when the web is of sufficient length to be passed entirely about the load from one side of the car to the other. Aside from their attractiveness to thieves, the webs may also be susceptible to needless damage during loading and unloading of the railroad cars, and when stowed for an empty return passage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> When the cars are being returned empty, the straps are typically tightened directly between the center beam and the winch, and remain exposed to the weather. Also, in remaining exposed, the webs may attract the attention of opportunistic thieves in a way that they might not otherwise do if stored out of sight. It would be advantageous to have an apparatus that permits the webs to be collected in a fashion suitable for storage, such as a reel, and a storage compartment that may keep the reeled up webs out of sight during empty operation of the cars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> A flat deck center beam car, whether having inclined risers and tapered posts or a fully planar horizontal deck with vertically sided posts will typically have a main deck height of approximately 41 inches above top of rail. Yard personnel working adjacent to the car may find this to be a convenient working height, like a tall work bench. It may not be a convenient height to climb without a ladder or footstep. In such a situation it may be advantageous to have a reeling mechanism for spooling the webbing that is located near or at the side sill. As such, a person standing adjacent to the rail car may be able to operate the mechanism without ascending the deck. In this position it would be advantageous to have a reeling mechanism, and a storage mechanism that is located in, or movable to, a position clear of the deck so that it does not obstruct loading or unloading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> By contrast, for a dropped deck center beam car having a depressed central deck portion the medial deck height may be of the order of 20 to 30 inches above top of rail, and may tend to be mounted relatively easily without the need for a ladder. Further, if the end portions are raised to a height of 50 to 60 inches above top of rail, it may be easier first to ascend the medial portion of the deck, then to ascend the end portions of the deck and to work from deck level rather than working from trackside. In such a situation, a reeling mechanism and storage boxes placed in the space between the posts of the center beam may be advantageous. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The description which follows, and the embodiments described therein, are provided by way of illustration of an example, or examples of particular embodiments of the principles of the present invention. These examples are provided for the purposes of explanation, and not of limitation, of those principles and of the invention. In the description which follows, like parts are marked throughout the specification and the drawings with the same respective reference numerals. The drawings are not necessarily to scale and in some instances proportions may have been exaggerated in order more clearly to depict certain features of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> In terms of general orientation and directional nomenclature, for each of the rail road cars described herein, the longitudinal direction is defined as being coincident with the rolling direction of the car, or car unit, when located on tangent (that is, straight) track. In the case of a car having a center sill, whether a through center sill or stub sill, the longitudinal direction is parallel to the center sill, and parallel to the side sills, if any. Unless otherwise noted, vertical, or upward and downward, are terms that use top of rail TOR as a datum. The term lateral, or laterally outboard, refers to a distance or orientation extending cross-wise relative to the longitudinal centerline of the railroad car, or car unit, indicated as CL-Rail Car. The term &ldquo;longitudinally inboard&rdquo;, or &ldquo;longitudinally outboard&rdquo; is a distance or orientation relative to a mid-span lateral section of the car, or car unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> A center beam railroad car is indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>generally as <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It is carried on railroad car trucks <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in a rolling direction along rails in the generally understood manner of railcars. Car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a longitudinal centerline <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> lying in a longitudinal plane of symmetry, indicated generally as <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> which intersects the kingpin connections of trucks <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that aside from fittings such as hand grabs, ladders, brake fittings, and couplers, the structure of car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is symmetrical about the longitudinal plane of symmetry, and also about a transverse plane of symmetry <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> at the mid-length station of the car. In that light, a structural description of one half of the car will serve to describe the other half as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The structure of a center beam car, such as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, is analogous to a deep beam having a tall central structure to approximate the web of a beam, or a web-like structure or truss assembly, a wide flange at the bottom, and a wide flange at the top. In the case of railroad car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the central web-work assembly is indicated generally as <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and runs in the longitudinal direction (that is, the rolling direction of the car), the top flange function is served by a top truss assembly <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and the lower flange function is performed by a lower flange assembly in the nature of a lateral support structure <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, upon which cargo can be placed, and that extends laterally outward to either side of the car center line <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In detail, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has at its lowest extremity main center sill <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, in the nature of a fabricated steel box beam that extends longitudinally along the centerline of car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> throughout its length, having couplers <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) mounted at either end. Cross bearers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extend outwardly from center sill <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to terminate at a pair of longitudinal left and right hand side sills <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that also run the length of the car. In the car illustrated, cross members in the nature of cross-bearers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and cross-ties <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> extend laterally outward from center sill <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on approximately 4 ft centers. Decking <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is mounted to extend between cross-bearers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and cross-ties <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> providing a shear connection between adjacent cross members when side loads are imposed on the car. Decking <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> has deck sheeting lying flush, or roughly flush, with the top flange of main center sill <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, roughly <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> inches above top of rail. Tapered risers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are mounted above the cross members to form the base, or lower, upwardly facing, lading interface of a bunk for carrying loads, the upper surfaces of risers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> lying substantially in a common plane. That is, although the deck is considered to be conceptually planar, there is a longitudinal camber of the deck structure generally, but for which the upper surfaces of risers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> lie in a common plane. When car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is fully loaded, the deck structure will tend to deflect toward a true planar condition. Risers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are tapered so that loads stacked thereupon will tend to lean inwardly toward the center-line of car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The combined structure of center sill <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, cross-bearers <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, cross-ties <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, and side sills <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and decking <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> provides a wide, lower beam or lower flange assembly extending laterally outward from the longitudinal centerline of car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> At either end of car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> there are vertically upstanding fore and aft end bulkheads <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> which extend from side to side, perpendicular to the central longitudinal plane <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Running the full length of car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> between end bulkheads <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is an array <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of upright posts <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>. Array <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is reinforced by diagonal braces <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. As also shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>array <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of posts <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (and <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>) is surmounted by an upper beam assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and deep beam top chord assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. An open framework top truss <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is mounted above, and connected to deep beam top chord assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Truss <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has lateral wings <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> that are mounted to extend outboard from the central plane of car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a cantilevered manner. Truss <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> has longitudinal stringers <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and cross members <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Each of posts <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> has a central web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> that lies in a vertical plane perpendicular to the plane <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> is tapered from a wide bottom adjacent main center sill <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to a narrow top. The wide bottom portion is about 13&frac12; inches wide, and at the top portion the inward taper is such as to yield a 6 inch width of section at the junction of top chord assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and top truss <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. At the outboard extremities of web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> there are left and right hand flanges <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> that each lie in a longitudinal plane inclined at an angle &agr; defined (from the vertical) by the slope of the taper of web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>&agr; (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) is roughly 1.45&deg;. At the top of each post <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> has been trimmed back to a pair of tabs <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> at the ends of flanges <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. This yields a seat, socket, relief, or rebate in the nature of a generally U-shaped notch or slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> into which top chord assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> can seat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> A horizontal cross-section of post <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may generally have an H-shape, with web <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> extending laterally between flanges <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. Post <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>, by contrast, although tapered in a similar manner to post <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, has a horizontal cross-section of a U-shaped channel, with its web being the back of the U, and the flanges being a pair of legs extending away from the back. Each diagonal member <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (or <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>) has a first end rooted at a lower lug <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> welded at the juncture of the base of one of the posts <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (or <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>) and main center sill <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, and a second diagonal end rooted in an upper lug <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> at the juncture of another adjacent post <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (or <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>) and top chord assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Midway along its length, diagonal beam <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (or <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>) passes through a post <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> intermediate the posts <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (or <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight>) to which diagonal <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (or <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>) is mounted. It is intended that the respective flanges of the various posts <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> lie in the same planes on either side of the central plane <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to present an aligned set of bearing surfaces against which lading can be placed. The incline of flanges <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> is such that they lie at roughly a right angle to the inward taper of rungs <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> so that generally square or rectangular bundles can be stacked neatly in the clearance opening of the bunk defined between the underside of the top truss <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and risers <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>upper beam assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be defined as the combination of top chord assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and top truss <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. It has a cross section in the shape, generally, of a &lsquo;T&rsquo;, with the cross-bar of the T being defined by wings <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of top truss <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, and the stem <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of the &lsquo;T&rsquo; being defined by top chord assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, described more fully below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Webbing bands, identified as straps <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) are provided to attach to the outboard, distal extremities of wings <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> of top truss <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, to be wrapped outboard of the load as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>and to be tightened by a come-along, a winch, a pawl-and-ratchet type of mechanism, indicated generally as <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, or similar tightening device mounted to the respective side sill <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. An operator turns mechanism <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> with the aid of an extension bar or handle (not shown) or other device such as a &frac34; inch ratchet drive. When tightened, straps <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> bear against the outboard, upper corners of bundles indicated as <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, tending to force their inboard, upper regions, indicated generally as <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, most tightly against the upright car structure that extends parallel to plane of symmetry <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, namely array <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the outer shank, or skirt of stem <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> of upper beam assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Straps <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are preferably web bands made of a woven synthetic fibre, such as nylon (t.m.) or polyester or PVC, with a fastening attachment anchor fitting at one end. The web bands may be typically <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>&Prime; wide. The anchor fitting can be a hook, or ring, or loop to which the web material itself is sewn, such as by folding an end over a loop or bar, and then sewing the band back on itself. It the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>for example, the anchor fitting (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) is a loop, identified as item <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight>, that mates with a fitting in the nature of a catch, or hook, located alternatively on the wing extremities when the car is fully loaded, or on the vertical posts at intermediate heights corresponding to lower loading heights of bundles. In cars employing steel cables rather than web bands, item <highlight><bold>93</bold></highlight> could be a short length of chain mounted to the end of the cable, the links of the chain being engageable with a notched fitting on the top truss wings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> When the car is unloaded, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a, </italic></highlight>straps <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> can have their far ends engaged in one of the intermediate notches mounted to the posts. In this position the other end of the strap is fed through the slot, or eye, in the shaft of winch mechanism <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, and wound until tight. The car can then be returned empty with straps <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> secured in this position. However, it is preferable to remove the band (i.e., strap <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>) from winch mechanism <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>, to reel it up, and to store it in a coil in a storage box. To that end car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a lading securement storage apparatus, indicated generally as <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a reeling mechanism <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>), described in more detail below, and a storage mechanism <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>the deck structure has rectangular reliefs <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> cut in the deck sheets (i.e., decking <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>) adjacent to the junction of successive cross ties <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> with the respective side sills <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. It is advantageous for there to be a number of reliefs corresponding to the number of straps <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, to be stored. These reliefs provide access to, and accommodate, a movable storage enclosure having the form of a generally rectangular box, <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> Box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> has a thickness, or small dimension &lsquo;L&rsquo; corresponding to the width of the web bands, although somewhat wider, such as about 7&Prime; to allow for moderately uneven winding of a narrower reel, such as a reel formed of a 4 inch web, and to allow for easier removal by hand. Seen in the longitudinal direction looking along the side sill, as in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c, </italic></highlight>box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> has a height &lsquo;H&rsquo; and a width &lsquo;W&rsquo; of comparable size, the width being larger than the height, and being suited to yield a box of height and depth for accommodating the wound web band. Box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> has a top panel, identified as top wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a pair of left and right parallel, planar side panels identified as walls <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that are welded to depend from the long side margins of top panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>; and a bent backing panel formed into a back portion identified as back wall <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, and a bottom portion identified as bottom wall <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. It may be noted that side walls <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> each have a diagonal nip, or chamfer <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>, at their lower inner comer (as seen in the raised position), this chamfer leaving a gap at the comer and thus providing a drain hole to discourage accumulation of water in box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> As can be seen, top wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, back wall <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and bottom wall <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> are welded about three sides or margins of the periphery of side walls <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The fourth side, or portion, of the periphery of side walls <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> is left open, except for a lip <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> formed upwardly at the distal end of bottom wall <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The opening defined between the fourth, unboxed portion of the periphery of side walls <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, lip <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, and the distal edge, or margin of top wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is of a size to receive a reeled web band roughly 9 inches in diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> A sleeve <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is welded along the outer surface of back wall <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> adjacent to the junction of back wall <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> with top wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, and forms a pivot fitting on a shaft <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) that is mounted between a pair of bores, <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> formed in side bars <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> mounted to the underside of the deck panel <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> adjacent to the cross-ties. As such, box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is pivotally mounted to move between a raised position, shown in phantom lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a lowered, or storage position, shown in solid lines in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>The fourth, open portion of the periphery of side walls <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> has an arcuate profile formed on a constant radius &lsquo;R&rsquo; relative to the longitudinal axis of sleeve <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. Notably, top wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is shorter than this radius, such that a gap &lsquo;G&rsquo; (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) is left between the distal edge of top wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the inner edge of the side sill, be it <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> as the case may be. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> The long margins of top wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> each have a lip <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> extending beyond side walls <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, respectively to overlap the respective upper faces of bars <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. As such, bars <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> also act as stops, or abutments limiting the travel of box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> into the stored position. A retention fitting for maintaining box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> in an open, or raised position is also provided. That is, a stay or prop in the nature of a pivotally mounted catch <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is mounted to the underside of bottom wall <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> near lip <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Catch <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> has a hook shape, with one end being identified as a bent hook <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>. Catch <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is pivotally mounted to box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, and the long depending end <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> being left to dangle, the long depending end having a piece of round stock <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>) welded to it. When box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is raised, as by lifting the distal edge of top panel <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the free end of hook <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> rides against the back, or inboard face of the web, of the side sill <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The weight of the rest of the hook will tend to keep hook <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> in contact with the side sill web until hook <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> clears the upper comer of the side sill web where it meets the side sill upper flange. At that point the free end of hook <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> being biased due to gravity acting on round stock <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight>, will tend to move outwards, and the long end <highlight><bold>133</bold></highlight> will tend to swing out to contact the web of the side sill. If box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is lowered slightly, hook <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> will catch as shown in phantom in the raised position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight>To release, box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is raised to take the weight off hook <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight>. Hook <highlight><bold>129</bold></highlight> is pushed inward, and box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is lowered until the overhanging edges, lips <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>, of top wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> abut the upper surfaces of bars <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> A clevis, or yoke, is formed by a pair of first and second bores <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> let through each of side walls <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> near the fourth portion of their respective peripheral margins. Bores <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> are provided to give a socket for web reeling device <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, in the nature of a winder, or crank <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Crank <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> has a shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> engageable with bores <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>; an arm, <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> extending radially from one end of shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>; and a throw, or handle, <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> by which crank <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be grasped and a torque imposed through arm <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> to turn shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> is a slotted shaft, slot <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> being of a size to accept radial threading by an end of a web band, namely strap <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. As such, when box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is in the raised, or operative position, crank <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be used to reel up strap <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> in a loose roll, or coil. Then, turning crank <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> backwards slightly, (in the direction opposite to the winding direction), may tend to loosen strap <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> in the center of the coil thus formed, thereby facilitating axial disengagement. Axially withdrawing shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> out of the socket provided by bores <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, may then tend to release the formed coil, or roll, permitting it to fall into the storage space defined within the walls of box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> also has a crank storage fitting in the nature of an intermediate internal plate, or web <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>) mounted parallel to top wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, web <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> being thinner than the width of slot <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>. Before box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is lowered, slot <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> of shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of handle <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is fed axially onto web <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, with handle <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> hanging downward. When box <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is lowered, crank <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may then tend to be trapped in a position for travelling. It is not necessary to have a crank for every storage box. That is, a single crank (or, preferably, at least one crank per car side) could be used to reel all of the web bands of a car. It may also be noted that inasmuch as shaft <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> can be introduced in either direction through bores <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, crank <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> can be operated either left handed or right handed. </paragraph>

In that light, a structural description of one half of the car will also serve to describe the other half. The features of car <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> thus enumerated are basic structural features of a center beam car having a depressed center deck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> In detail, main center sill <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> is a fabricated steel box beam that extends longitudinally along centerline <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> of car <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> throughout its length, having couplers <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> mounted at either end. Cross bearers <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and cross-ties <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> extend outwardly from center sill <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> to terminate at left and right hand side sills <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> that also run the length of the car. These cross bearers <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and cross ties <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight> extend laterally outward from center till <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> on approximately 4 ft centers. Deck sheeting, identified as decking <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, is mounted to extend between cross-bearers <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and cross-ties <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight>, providing a shear connection between opposing side sills when side loads are imposed on the car, as in cornering. The combined structure of center sill <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, cross-bearers <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, cross-ties <highlight><bold>341</bold></highlight>, side sills <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight> and decking <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> provides a wide, lading support assembly extending laterally outward from the longitudinal centerline <highlight><bold>325</bold></highlight> of car <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> As noted above, deck structure <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> has a first end portion, namely end deck portion <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight>, a second end deck portion, namely end deck portion <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight>, and a medial deck portion <highlight><bold>329</bold></highlight>. At each of the transitions from either end deck portion <highlight><bold>327</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> to medial deck portion <highlight><bold>329</bold></highlight> there is a knee, indicated respectively as <highlight><bold>347</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>349</bold></highlight>. Not only is deck structure <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> stepped in this manner, but so too are side sills <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>, each having first and second end members, or end portions, <highlight><bold>343</bold></highlight>, and a medial member, or medial side sill portion <highlight><bold>345</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> At either end of car <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> there are vertically upstanding fore and aft end bulkheads <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> which extend from side to side, perpendicular to the central longitudinal plane <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight> of car <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>. Running the full length of car <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> between end bulkheads <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is an array <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> of upright posts <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight>.

The array <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> of posts <highlight><bold>355</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>356</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>357</bold></highlight> is surmounted by an upper beam, namely top chord <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight> to form a central beam assembly standing upwardly of the deck structure. In this central beam structure, array <highlight><bold>354</bold></highlight> and the diagonal braces co-operate to provide a shear transfer web-like structure between center sill <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> and top chord <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. As shown, end bulkheads <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> are taller than the central beam assembly. That is, taken relative to top of rail, the height of the top of the bulkheads is greater than the height of the upper extremity of top chord <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>. As such, car <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> is a dropped deck center beam rail road car having a reduced height top chord without laterally extending truss wings. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> In the foregoing examples, car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a deck having tapered risers, posts inclined to match the taper to form a right angle, and an overhead top truss with laterally extending wings. Car <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, by contrast, has a dropped deck configuration, has planar horizontal decks, posts with parallel vertical sides, a top chord that is located at a reduced height relative to the end bulkheads, and no top truss. For the purpose of avoiding redundant description, it will be understood that these features can be combined in other configurations. That is, a straight-through flat deck, as in car <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, can lie in a horizontal plane, rather than having tapered risers, and can have straight, parallel sided vertical posts rather than tapered posts. Further, a straight through flat deck car need not have a top truss, and need not have a full height beam, but rather can have a reduced height beam as shown in rail car <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>.

It is advantageous to use larger panels as this may tend to provide some protection to the coils of webbing from stones and other debris cast up during movement of the railcars. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> It may also be noted that in each of the embodiments shown and described herein the storage box, or enclosure, is mounted in a position clear of the envelope in which the lading is carried. That is, whether the car has angled risers and tapered posts, or a flat deck and vertical posts with no taper, the storage enclosure lies clear of the bunks defined by the vertical lading bunk interface (such as the plane of the post flanges) and the horizontal, or lower lading bunk interface (be it defined by a flat continuous deck or by the upper surfaces of an array of risers). In some instances, as described and illustrated above, the storage enclosure may be mounted between the posts of the center beam structure, and in other cases the storage enclosure may be mounted in the deck structure adjacent to the side sills. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Various embodiments of the invention have now been described in detail. Since changes in and or additions to the above-described best mode may be made without departing from the nature, spirit or scope of the invention, the invention is not to be limited to those details, but only by the appended claims. </paragraph>
