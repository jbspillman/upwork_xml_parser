<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates, in general, to trocars to assist in performing minimally invasive surgery and, more particularly, to improved seals for such trocars. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The use of endoscopic procedures in surgery has become widely accepted. The term endoscopic as used herein is defined to include all types of minimally invasive surgical procedures including laparoscopic and arthroscopic procedures. Accordingly, numerous endoscopic instruments have been developed which allow the surgeon to perform complex surgical procedures with minimal incisions into the skin and tissue surrounding a particular body cavity or anatomical region. In order to introduce the endoscopic instrumentation into the body cavity, it is often necessary to puncture and cannulate the body cavity by using a trocar. Trocars are widely known in the art and typically consist of an obturator and a trocar cannula. An example of a trocar can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,017,356 issued to Frederick et al. on Jan. 25, 2000, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is common for a sealing arrangement or sealing device to be used in association with the cannula to prevent the escape of fluid or gas during endoscopic procedures. During an endoscopic surgical procedure, the internal gas pressure must be maintained in order to successfully complete the procedure. In order to maintain the internal gas pressure while instruments are passed into and out of the trocars positioned in a body cavity, sealing devices are required for both the instruments and for the trocar assemblies. That is most trocars have two sealing devices. One which seals the trocar when there is not an instrument passing therethrough, and one which seals the trocar as instruments are passed therethrough. Furthermore, it is desirable that the sealing device maintain gas pressure in the abdominal cavity, despite numerous insertions and withdrawals of surgical instruments through the trocar cannula. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Most commercially available trocars have an outer seal and an inner seal. The outer seal is typically a gasket located at the proximal most end of the trocar cannula. This gasket tightly fits itself around the elongated shafts of any medical devices passing therethrough. Therefore, the outer seal prevents fluids from escaping the body cavity through the trocar cannula while surgical instruments are being used with the cannula. The inner seal is typically what is referred to as a flapper door. It is made from a rigid, typically plastic, door which is spring biased against an inner gasket. The inner seal prevents fluids from escaping the body cavity through the trocar cannula while the trocar cannula is not in use, i.e. with no surgical instruments or obturators passing therethrough. The inner seal is located with the trocar cannula handle, distal to the outer seal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> While for the most part the above design works well, there has been a tendency for the outer seal, or gasket, to tear during surgery. If a physician were to align a surgical instrument directly over the outer gaskets opening, with the longitudinal axis of the instrument parallel with the longitudinal axis of the trocar cannula, tearing would not be an issue. However, often times the physician enters the trocar cannula with the surgical instrument at an angle with respect to the cannula. This often causes the tip of the surgical instrument to be forced upon the wall of the gasket causing the gasket to tear. A torn gasket can lead to leaks during the surgical procedure, and may require the physician to insert a new cannula. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Others have tried to solve this problem. One attempted solution was a floating gasket, wherein the outer gasket floated on a bellows type structure. Examples of this type of seal are given in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,209,737 issued to Ritchart et al. on May 11, 1993; 5,385,553 issued to Hart et al on Jan. 31, 1995; and 5,308,336 issued to Hart et al. on May 3, 1994, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. However, this type of floating seal does not always significantly reduce the incidents of tearing. In addition, these types of seals can often be expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Therefore, there has been a desire for an improved trocar seal design which significantly reduces the incidents of tearing during surgical procedures. There has also been a desire to provide such a design in a cost effective manner. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, there is shown trocar <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> made in accordance with the present invention. Trocar <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a sleeve assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and obturator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As seen from the figures, obturator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes an elongated shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a distal end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a proximal end <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Distal end <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a penetrating tip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> disposed thereon. Penetrating tip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is a safety shielded penetrating tip and is well known in the art and is described in the hereinbefore incorporated references. Proximal end <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of shaft <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a hub or handle <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> attached thereto. Hub <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> contains latch <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> which secures obturator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to sleeve assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Buttons <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (not shown) are connected to latch <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Sleeve assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of trocar <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a hollow cannula <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> having a distal end <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and a proximal end <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. The trocar further includes a generally hollow housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a distal end <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> attached to proximal end <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> of cannula <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, whereby cannula <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> extends distally from housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further includes a proximal end <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> having a wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> attached thereto. Wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has an aperture <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> extending therethrough. Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, it can be understood that the trocar <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> further includes a hollow tubular guide member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> has a proximal end <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> is attached to wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> about aperture <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> further includes a distal end <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> extending away from wall <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Trocar <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> includes a first seal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which is adjacent to the distal end <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. First seal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is an elastomeric conical member and can be made from silicone, polyisoprene, or any other material known to those skilled in the art. First seal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a proximal end <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> which is sandwiched between member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and frame <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> of housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for securement. First seal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> at its distal end <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> further includes a second seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> immediately adjacent to distal end <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of seal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> but not abutting. Second seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> includes a gasket <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> fixedly secured to frame <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and flapper door <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> pivotably secured to frame <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Flapper door <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> is biased against gasket <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> by a spring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> attached to frame <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. Spring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> can be made from any elastic material, such as stainless steel, which recovers somewhat upon being deformed. Second seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has an open position (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) and closed position (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). When second seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is in an open position, there is fluid communication between aperture <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and cannula <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. When second seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is in a closed position, fluid communication between aperture <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and cannula <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is substantially prevented. Lastly, the longitudinal spacing between the flapper door <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> and distal end <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of seal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is between about 0.25 inch to about 0.05 inch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> When using trocar <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> in a surgical procedure, obturator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted through aperture <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and cannula <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. When obturator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fully inserted into sleeve assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, hub <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is secured to housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by latch <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Penetrating tip <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of obturator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> extends distally from cannula <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In an actual surgical procedure utilizing the device of the present invention, a surgeon, using a scalpel, makes a small incision where trocar <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is to be positioned during the surgical procedure. The distal end of trocar <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is then inserted into the tissue exposed by the small incision. After insertion into the tissue, trocar <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is advanced into the interior of a body, such as the abdominal cavity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> After penetration into the abdominal cavity is complete, obturator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is removed from sleeve assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> by pressing buttons <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> (not shown) which releases latch <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> from housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. When obturator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is removed second seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> connected to valve lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> closes. After closing, second seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is retained upon gasket <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> by flapper spring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to prevent any fluid or gas from escaping sleeve assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. If desired, a pressurizing gas such as carbon dioxide can be selectively pumped through cannula <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> via stopcock <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to insufflate the surgical site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, an instrument <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, such as a linear stapler, grasper, clip applier, scope etc., can then be inserted through aperture <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> into sleeve assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> to perform a procedure at the surgical site. Often, instrument <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is blindly inserted into housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a surgeon during the surgical procedure. This causes instrument <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, to be inserted into housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at an angle with respect to longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. To reduce the angle of insertion, hollow tubular guide member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> aligns instrument <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> substantially parallel with longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of sleeve assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> before sealing occurs. For example, using a 3 mm trocar and a 2.2 mm instrument, guide member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the present invention would reduce the angle of insertion into first seal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as great as 40.2 degrees. This decreases the risk of tearing first seal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which tightly fits itself around instrument <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to prevent any fluid or gas from escaping sleeve assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The greater the length of the guide member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the more the instrument will become aligned before reaching the seal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. However, surgeons prefer to have smaller housings, as they might interfere with their work. Therefore, the length of member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is somewhat limited. However, the conical design of first seal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> helps to increase this longitudinal distance by placing the aperture <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> even deeper within the housing. As instrument <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is advanced through first seal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, its conical design helps to further reduce tearing by orientating instrument <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> rather than deflecting during insertion. Instrument <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can then be inserted further into housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> causing second seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> connected to valve lever <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to separate from gasket <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. After instrument <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is completely advanced through housing <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, flapper spring <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> retains second seal <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> against instrument <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in an open position. Instrument <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can then be completely inserted through cannula <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to perform the desired procedure at the surgical site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> An additional benefit of sleeve assembly <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the present invention is a decrease in the drag on instrument <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> which thus causes an increase in the stability of trocar <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. One way to decrease the drag on instrument <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, is to increase the diameter of opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. This increase in the diameter of opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be achieved because the first seal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is positioned closer to center pivot point of instrument <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Because the amount instrument <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be placed off axis is reduced, opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be larger. Having first seal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> distal to guide member <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> increases the distance between aperture <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and first seal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. By increasing this distance, there is less leak from holding instrument <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> off center to opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> enabling an increase in its diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only. Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention be limited only by the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
