<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Wireless radio links have become increasingly important to provide data communication links for a variety of applications. For example, Internet Service Providers have begun to utilize wireless radio links within urban settings to avoid the installation expense of traditional wired connections or optical fiber. The typical architecture of such wireless systems involves establishing an outdoor unit at a node of the wireless system. The outdoor unit contains an antenna and a transceiver. Additionally, the radio unit is connected via a cable to an indoor unit. The indoor unit contains a modem to recover the digital data contained within the received signal and to add digital data to a carrier for ultimate transmission by the radio unit. The separation of functionality between indoor units and outdoor units has been maintained for several reasons. Among these reasons, maintenance of an indoor unit facilitates greater thermal stability of the modem unit and further increases reliability of the communication link. Additionally, the communication channel between the indoor unit and the outdoor unit is often allocated utilizing a Time Division Duplex (TDD) scheme, i.e. the communication over the cable successively alternates between receive and transmit modes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> By maintaining separate modem and radio functionality and utilizing a TDD scheme, these systems require some method of synchronizing the modem and radio units. The synchronization mechanism ensures that both units will be in receive and transmit modes at the proper times. Known systems utilize a unique word (a series of pre-defined digital symbols for detection by the radio unit) to derive a frame pulse. Each frame pulse results in a counter being reset. The radio unit is preprogrammed to define transmit and receive time slots based upon this counter. Accordingly, the modem is capable of causing the radio unit to synchronize to the modem by signaling the unique word. Additionally, dynamic variations in transmit and receive slots may be implemented by signaling time slot parameters via a control channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The use of a unique word and time slot parameters suffers several limitations. First, the use of a unique word and time slot parameters prevents rapid variation in time slot duration. Specifically, the bandwidth utilized to signal the unique word as well as the time slot parameters is not sufficient to permit dynamic allocation of the communication channel on a millisecond by millisecond basis. It is anticipated that more efficient channel access methods will be required for point-to-multipoint systems as these systems provide services to a greater number of users. Accordingly, dynamic and rapid variation of time slots is a valuable mechanism for maximizing the efficiency of such access methods. Additionally, the use of a unique word is problematic, since the timing of the system relies upon the frame pulse. If a unique word is not detected and a frame pulse is consequently missed, the timing information may become skewed which could cause the communication link to be broken. Accordingly, unique word synchronization involves a degree of inherent unreliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to a system and method which selectively enable and disable the transmit and receive functions of a radio. In the preferred embodiment, a modem and a radio are remotely located. The modem and radio preferably communicate via an IF signal over a communication channel in a Time Division Duplex manner, i.e. the same communication channel is alternatively allocated as a transmit path and a receive path. Additionally, the modem preferably creates an unique frequency as a discrete out-of-band tone. The transmit path of the radio preferably filters the tone from the received signal. The radio preferably contains a separate mechanism to detect the out-of-band tone. This mechanism converts the out-of-band tone to a logical signal. If the logical signal is present, the radio operates through the transmit path. Preferably, the radio defaults to the receive path if the logical signal is not present. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According, certain embodiments of the present invention provide a more robust mechanism for dynamically controlling transmit and receive functions between separate modem and radio modules. Certain embodiments the present invention provide a more easily detected signaling mechanism for dynamically controlling the transmit and receive functions between separate modem and radio modules. Also, certain embodiments of the invention provide a mechanism for dynamically controlling transmit and receive functions between separate modem and radio modules that requires minimal switching times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of the present invention avoids the problems of the prior art by providing a control signal from the modem to the transceiver where said control signal is substantially coextensive with the communication signal being sent by the modem to the transceiver for transmission. The control signal and the communication signal may be sent over the same cable connecting the modem and the transceiver. In the situation where the control signal and the communication signal are sent over the same cable, the control signal preferably is at a frequency different than the frequency of the communication signal so as to avoid material interference between the two signals. The control signal may be a tone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the transceiver is normally in receive mode and is in transmit mode for the duration of the control signal. The control signal is not sent from the modem as a part of the communication signal to set the transmit and receive slots via a counter thereby taking up valuable bits in the communication signal and thereby delaying the switching of the transceiver between modes. The control signal, unlike a unique word in the prior art, does not set a counter which defines the transmit slot of the transceiver. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a more robust mechanism for dynamically controlling transmit and receive functions between separate modem and radio modules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a more easily detected signaling mechanism dynamically controlling the transmit and receive functions between separate modem and radio modules. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a mechanism for dynamically controlling transmit and receive functions between separate modem and radio modules that require switching times. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide a control signal from a modem to a transceiver where the control signal is substantially coextensive with, and at a different frequency than, a communication signal to be transmitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a control signal from a modem to a transceiver wherein the transceiver remains in the transmit mode only for the duration of the control signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a control signal and a communication signal from a modem to a transceiver over the same cable at different frequencies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> These and many other objects and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art to which the invention pertains from a perusal of the claims, the appended drawings, and the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the invention.

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, millimeter wave transceiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> implements a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The remotely located modem (not shown) communicates a multiplexed signal via cable connection <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to transceiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, which contains transmit section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and receive section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In this preferred embodiment, the modem is an on/off keying modem associated with indoor equipment with transceiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the antenna being associated with an outdoor unit. Cable connection <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> provides a bi-directional link. The bi-directional link is alternatively allocated between transmit and receive signaling in a Time Division Duplex (TDD) scheme. Additionally, transceiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> receives commands from indoor equipment. Similarly, transceiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> reports status and alarm information to the indoor equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, cable connection <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is coupled to pentaplexer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Pentaplexer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> implements functionality to allow multiplexing of five signals via the single communication link between the modem assembly and transceiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The five signals include one DC power signal to power transceiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a high stability frequency source, a reference signal to synchronize the local oscillators <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for the up-conversion and down-conversion, a communication signal, and a tone control signal. As previously noted, this preferred embodiment remotely locates the modem from transceiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In practice, the modem may be located at any distance including co-location utilizing a single commercially available cable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Transceiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> contains switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> comprises three sub-components <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. When the switch sub-components (<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) are in the upper state, transceiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in transmit mode. Conversely, when the switch subcomponents are in the lower state, transceiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in receive mode. In transmit mode, the IF signal is received via cable connection <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, processed through transmit section <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> (as will be detailed later), and outputted via antenna connection <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. In receive mode, the RF receive signal is received from antenna connection <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, processed through receive section <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (as will be detailed later), and outputted via cable connection <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Oscillators <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are preferably designed to be common to both the receive and transmit sections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In transmit mode, the modem generates a RF signal communicated to transceiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via cable connection <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The RF signal contains an IF modulated data signal that will be up-converted for transmission via the antenna. In a preferred embodiment, the IF signal is a 140 MHz signal. In other embodiments, the IF signal is one of the following frequencies: 70, 280, 480 MHz. Additionally, the RF signal contains the tone control signal, which preferably possesses a frequency within the range of 5-50 MHz. In an embodiment, the control tone possesses a frequency of 35 MHz. As previously noted, certain embodiments may utilize a high stability frequency source (i.e., a timing reference signal) to synchronize the local oscillators <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In such embodiments, the control tone may be implemented as a convenient harmonic of the frequency associated with the timing reference signal. Preferably, the tone control is sufficiently separated from the 140 MHz IF signal to avoid interference. The IF signal passes through filter <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> and, in a preferred embodiment, is band-limited filtered to a spectrum width of 50 MHz. It shall be appreciated that other bandwidths for the filter are contemplated so long as the control signal can be distinguished from the communication signal. Detector <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> receives the band-limited signal to determine whether the modem has communicated the tone control signal. Detector <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> produces a logical signal. If detector <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> detects the tone control signal, detector <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> cause the logical signal to represent a true state. If the logical signal is true, switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> causes sub-components <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to remain in or transition to the upper state. If the logical signal is false, switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> causes sub-components <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to remain in or transition to the lower state. Preferably, the detector <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> causes the logical signal to default to the false state. Thus, transceiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> defaults to receive mode. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It shall be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the present method and system employing a detector and an out of band control tone provides significantly lower switching times. Use of a control tone in lieu of a unique word considerably simplifies the detection mechanism. Additionally, the use of a control tone is more robust than the unique word approach. Systems employing the unique word approach are more vulnerable to timing errors due to noise. Since the unique word is signaled by a predetermined series of symbols, timing errors may occur if one or a few symbols of the unique word are improperly decoded due to noise. However, the present invention does not involve this limitation. The present invention does not detect the control tone in a dependent manner based upon prior states. Accordingly, the timing functionality of the present invention is more resistant to thermal noise and interference. Moreover, utilizing the control tone to dynamically schedule transmit and receive modes requires far less bandwidth than communicating receive and transmit frame parameters via a control channel. Accordingly, the control tone facilitates dynamic alteration of the receive and transmit timing in a more efficient manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> When the transceiver is in receive mode, switch sub-components <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> remain in the lower state. This allows RF signals received by the antenna from cable <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> to pass through switch sub-component <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to linear amplifier <highlight><bold>1218</bold></highlight>. After amplification, the RF signal passes through band-pass filter <highlight><bold>1217</bold></highlight> and down conversion mixer <highlight><bold>1215</bold></highlight>. Down conversion mixer <highlight><bold>1215</bold></highlight> is coupled to local oscillator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> via amplifier <highlight><bold>1216</bold></highlight>. The signal passes through a second amplifier <highlight><bold>1214</bold></highlight>, a second band-pass filter <highlight><bold>1213</bold></highlight>, and a second buffer <highlight><bold>1212</bold></highlight>. The signal passes through down-conversion mixer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> and IF amplifier <highlight><bold>1209</bold></highlight>. Down-conversion mixer <highlight><bold>1210</bold></highlight> is coupled to local oscillator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> via amplifier <highlight><bold>1211</bold></highlight>. Filter component <highlight><bold>1208</bold></highlight> selectively filters the signal by selecting from a plurality of predetermined bandwidths. The signal is processed by slope attenuator <highlight><bold>1207</bold></highlight> to provide slope compensation. The signal is additionally amplified by linear amplifier <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>. Additional slope compensation is provided by slope attenuator <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight>. Additional slope compensation is provided by slope attenuator <highlight><bold>1203</bold></highlight>. The signal is path is continued by switch sub-component <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, which provides further path isolation. The signal is further processed by voltage variable attenuator <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight>. The signal passes through buffer amplifier <highlight><bold>1201</bold></highlight> and switch sub-component <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to pentaplexer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> via filter <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight>. Pentaplexer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> multiplexes the processed IF signal for communication over cable connection <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the modem. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> When the tone control signal is detected and the logical signal state is true, the transceiver operates in transmit mode. Switch sub-components <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are maintained in the upper state. In transmit mode, the modem produces and multiplexes a pay-load IF signal via cable connection <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The IF signal is received by pentaplexer <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The signal is filtered by filter <highlight><bold>1302</bold></highlight> and proceeds via switch sub-component <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to voltage variable attenuator <highlight><bold>1101</bold></highlight> for cable and gain compensation. The signal passes through IF amplifier <highlight><bold>1104</bold></highlight> and voltage variable attenuator <highlight><bold>1105</bold></highlight> that provides gain adjustment due to temperature variation. The signal is up-converted by mixer <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight>. Mixer <highlight><bold>1106</bold></highlight> is coupled to local oscillator <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> via amplifier <highlight><bold>1108</bold></highlight>. The signal is successively filtered by bandpass filters <highlight><bold>1109</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1110</bold></highlight>. The signal is further amplified by amplifier <highlight><bold>1111</bold></highlight> before up-conversion to millimeter wave range by mixer <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight>. Mixer <highlight><bold>1112</bold></highlight> is coupled to local oscillator <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> via amplifier <highlight><bold>1115</bold></highlight>. The millimeter wave signal is filter by bandpass filter <highlight><bold>1113</bold></highlight> and amplified by amplifier <highlight><bold>1114</bold></highlight>. Since the control tone has been detected and the logical signal is true, switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> completes the circuit path allowing the processed signal to proceed to the antenna via antenna connection <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The modem also generates an auxiliary modem signal communicated via cable connection <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The auxiliary modem signal is separated from the main IF signal and is received by on/off keying transceiver item <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Microprocessor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> controls the synthesizers and switches internal to transceiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> assembly via the data stream from the modem communicated by the auxiliary signal. Microprocessor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also communicates status information in the reverse direction to the modem. Additionally, the microprocessor may control detector <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> to operate the logical signal independently of the out of band signal. In this manner, the transceiver may be made compatible with modems that do not employ the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, where like components have like numbers and function in a like manner to the similar numbered components in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</cross-reference>, the modem <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is connected to the transceiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> via the cable <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The transceiver <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes the tone decoder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which includes the filter <highlight><bold>1301</bold></highlight> and the detector <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The tone decoder is connected to the switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which operates in conjunction with switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (not shown), all of which operate to allow the transceiver to function in either the transmit or receive modes as previously described. The switch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is connected to the antenna <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which transmits outgoing communication signals and receives incoming communication signals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> It shall be appreciated that the preceding circuitry and signal path descriptions are merely exemplary. The transmit and receive sections are shown solely as a representative circuit. Any transmit and receive circuitry may be utilized. Additionally, any frequency ranges may be implemented with the present invention. Moreover, the control tone is not limited to a 35 MHz signal. The present invention may employ any other control signal provided that sufficient separation (at either end of the working frequency, or within the working frequency) is utilized to allow detection of the control signal. Also, the control tone signal need not be continuous. The control tone may be transmitted from time to time, depending upon system requirements. </paragraph>
