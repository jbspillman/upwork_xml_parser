<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, when the removable disk cartridge <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is to be drawn out for carrying, by virtue that the press member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is provided inside of the handle <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, when the handle <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is held with a hand, fingers can naturally press the press member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to move it rearwardly, now the recess <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> provided on both sides of the press member <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> automatically moves the detent member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> inwardly to retract the latter to get out of the engaging holes <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the receiving seat <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and detention action of the detent member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> disappears, just to exert a force rearwardly, the removable disk cartridge <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be taken out easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> And more, the bearing surfaces <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> inside of the removable disk cartridge <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> are connected with the frame <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the shape of &ldquo;&cap;&rdquo; by means of a plurality of rubber stubs <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> which have a good vibration absorbing effect, thereby, vibration created when the disk is running can all be absorbed by the rubber stubs <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In conclusion, the detent structure for a removable disk cartridge of the present invention synchronically moves the detent member by providing a simple press structure to render the removable disk cartridge to be drawn out more easily; and when in insertion in, firm connection of the removable disk cartridge can be clearly known; and vibration created can all be absorbed by the rubber stubs, an effect of vibration proofing can be obtained. Further, the entire space modeling of the removable disk cartridge in comparing to the structure of a conventional removable disk cartridges is novel. The detent structure for a removable disk cartridge of the present invention is evidently improved in effects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The above stated structure is only for illustrating a preferred embodiment and not for giving any limitation to the scope of the present invention. It will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various modifications or changes can be made to the elements of the present invention, and all such modifications and changes also fall within the scope of the appended claims and are intended to form part of this invention. </paragraph>
