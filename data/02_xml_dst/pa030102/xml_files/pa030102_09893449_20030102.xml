<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to a multi-mode image processing method and its corresponding system that can be applied to line art, gray-level and colors image processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A normal electronic graphics file is comprised of pixels. An image file is displayed by thousands up to millions of arrayed pixels. Computers use one of several bits of data combinations to record the brightness and colors of each pixel. The more bits there are in image data, the more stored information there is in the file, which of course occupies a lot of memory. Images according to their storage methods can be classified into three basic types: line art images, gray-level images and colors images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> For line art images, each pixel is recorded using one bit, indicating whether the pixel is black or white. This type of images is usually used in OCR (Optical Calligraphy Recognition). Halftone images use black-and-white images to generate an approximate effect to the gray-level images. In this case, a darker area contains more black dots, while a brighter area contains less. Therefore, images with different gray levels can be produced in this way. Most of the pictures seen in newspapers belong to this type of halftone images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Each pixel in a gray-level image takes more bits. For example, 4 bits are needed to present 16 gray levels. Similarly, 8 bits can represent 256 gray levels so that the black-and-white pictures become more realistic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Colors images contain more complicated data than line art and gray-level images. To obtain colors images, digital cameras and scanners split colors in an image (e.g., RGB colors) to analyze the light received from an object. Through this operation, all colors in the image can be reproduced by mixing the RGB colors in different proportions. As the selected modes differ, the color-recording limit can be 24-bit, 30-bit or even 36-bit RGB pixels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In practice, a single object often contains more than one image feature. For example, a newspaper contains line art images for texts, gray-level images for classified ads, and colors images for pictures. The photo part of a driver ID is a colors image, while the other parts are either line art or gray-level images. When making name cards, one often needs to simultaneously process the colors images for photo pictures, line art images for texts and gray-level images for trademarks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There are several processing methods in the prior art: one is to process everything in colors images. One merit is that there is a lot of information for the image so that it can mimic the true image. Nevertheless, the drawback is that it needs a huge amount of memory and requires along processing time. A second method is to process in line art or gray-level images. One advantage of this is that it requires less memory and a shorter processing time. But the drawback is that one loses some image information and the image cannot be truly reproduced. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Effects of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The invention discloses a method and a system of image processing in multiple modes. Image information is captured, edited and stored in line art, gray-level and colors multiple modes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Since the invention uses multiple modes to capture and store line art images, gray-level images, and colors images. Unnecessary image information can be skipped without employing any compression means. The memory needed is not too large and the image processing can speed up. As a single multi-mode image file is used to store all image information, one is free from losing any part of the information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described by way of example and in terms of the preferred embodiment, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. To the contrary, it is intended to cover various modifications and similar arrangements as would be apparent to those skilled in the art. Therefore, the scope of the appended claims should be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and similar arrangements. </paragraph>
