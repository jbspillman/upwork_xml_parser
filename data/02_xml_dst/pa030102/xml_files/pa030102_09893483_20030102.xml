<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to motor vehicle anti-lock brake systems, and more particularly to a control method that adaptively determines exit criteria for terminating anti-lock brake pressure modulation. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A motor vehicle anti-lock braking system (referred to herein as an ABS system) repeatedly releases and re-applies hydraulic brake pressures during conditions of wheel lock to maximize the tractive force between the vehicle tires and the road surface. Typically, the control is initiated in response to insipient wheel lock detection, and is exited when the driver fully releases the brake pedal or the vehicle deceleration vs. wheel slip operating point is in an exit region for at least a predetermined exit time interval. This strategy can unnecessarily delay the termination of ABS control when the driver only partially releases of the brake pedal, which is undesirable, particularly when the road surface coefficient of friction is relatively high. Accordingly, what is needed is method of exiting ABS control that reduces the exit delay, consistent with the road surface coefficient of friction, when the brake pedal is only partially released. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention is directed to an improved ABS control method in which exit criteria for terminating ABS control are adaptively determined based on rate of brake pedal release and estimates of the brake torque and road surface coefficient of friction. In the preferred embodiment, the brake torque and road surface coefficient of friction are estimated based on a periodically updated characterization of the relationship between brake pedal position and vehicle deceleration. In one aspect of the invention, an exit time interval is adaptively adjusted based on the estimated road surface coefficient of friction, and a control value used to determine if ABS control should be exited is adaptively biased toward exiting ABS control based on the brake pedal release rate and the estimated brake torque. In another aspect of the invention, ABS control is exited independent of the timer when the control value indicates that ABS control should be exited and the brake pedal release rate exceeds a threshold, provided the vehicle deceleration is higher than expected, based on the estimated road surface coefficient of friction. In another aspect of the invention, the ABS control is exited independent of the timer if the control value indicates that ABS control should be exited and the brake torque corresponding to the pedal position is significantly less than the maximum possible brake torque, given the estimated road surface coefficient of friction.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the present invention is disclosed in the context of an ABS system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for a vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having hydraulically-activated friction brakes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at each of four vehicle wheels <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. A driver-manipulated brake pedal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is mechanically coupled to a master cylinder (MC) <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> for producing hydraulic pressure in proportion to the force applied to pedal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Master cylinder <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which may include a pneumatic booster (not shown), proportions the hydraulic pressure between front and rear brake supply lines <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in a conventional manner. Front supply line <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is coupled to the left front service brake <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via left-front ABS modulator (M) <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and to the right front service brake <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> via right-front ABS modulator (M) <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Rear supply line <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is coupled to the left and right rear wheel brakes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via rear ABS modulator (M) <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> A microprocessor-based control unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> receives various inputs, including wheel speed signals on lines <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> from respective wheel speed sensors <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and a brake pedal position signal PP on line <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> from pedal position sensor <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The sensors <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be implemented with conventional devices in a manner known to those skilled in the art. In response to the various inputs, the control unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> outputs modulator control signals on lines <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> during wheel lock-up conditions, and diagnostic information signals on line <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> for display on a driver information device <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In general, the control unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> monitors the measured wheel speeds to detect a condition of insipient wheel lock, and then controls modulators <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to modulate the respective hydraulic brake pressures so as to maximize the tractive force between the vehicle tires and the road surface. In a conventional system, ABS control is terminated when the brake pedal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is fully released, or when the vehicle deceleration and wheel slip are such that ABS control is no longer needed. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a prior art approach in which a vehicle deceleration vs. wheel slip table is used to delineate two regions: Region I above the trace <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> for which ABS control is not needed, and Region II below the trace <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> for which ABS control is needed. As a practical matter, Region II of the table may contain other information, such as brake pressure apply and release rates. According to the conventional approach, ABS control is terminated if the vehicle remains in Region I for at least a predetermined exit time interval. As indicated above, however, this exit strategy tends to unnecessarily delay termination of ABS control when the driver only partially releases the brake pedal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. This issue is addressed by the present invention, which adaptively determines exit criteria based on the rate of brake pedal release and estimates of the brake torque and the road surface coefficient of friction. As described below, the brake torque and road surface coefficient of friction are estimated based on the brake pedal position and a periodically updated characterization of the relationship between brake pedal position and vehicle deceleration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> graphically depicts a representative relationship between vehicle deceleration and brake pedal position for defined braking of the vehicle <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, assuming that there is no lock-up condition and the modulators <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> are inactive. Typically, the &ldquo;knee&rdquo; portion of the relationship varies considerably from stop to stop, whereas the portion of the relationship above the knee tends to be linear and repeatable from stop to stop. For this reason, the knee portion of the relationship is ignored for purposes of this invention, and the brake pedal position vs. vehicle deceleration relationship is characterized only for pedal positions and vehicle decelerations in the linear portion above the knee. In the illustrated embodiment, depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the characterization data is collected by identifying the pedal position values PPCUR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, PPCUR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and PPCUR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> corresponding to three different vehicle deceleration values D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Of course, any number of data points may be used, and the data points may be defined in terms of pedal position, if desired. In any case, the braking data is only collected during braking operation when the pedal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is depressed at a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; rate or held at an essentially static position; data is not collected upon release of the pedal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> or during panic braking. This eliminates the need to compensate for the effects of suspension and powertrain dynamics, tire and sensor dynamics, and so on. The vehicle acceleration at the onset of braking is saved and subtracted from the deceleration during braking operation in order to compensate for the effects of engine braking and road grade. Of course, the road grade and other factors such as vehicle weight and the effects of brake heating may be estimated and used to compensate the collected braking data; see for example, the U.S. Pat. No. 6,212,458 to Walenty et al., issued on Apr. 3, 2001, and incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The characterization table is periodically updated to reflect a current condition of the braking effectiveness, and the brake torque BRAKE_TQ for any brake pedal position PP greater than or equal to PPCUR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be determined according to the expression: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>BRAKE<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>TQ&equals;&lsqb;</italic></highlight>((<highlight><italic>PP&minus;PPCUR</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)*(<highlight><italic>PPCUR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&minus;PPCUR</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)/(<highlight><italic>D</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&minus;<highlight><italic>D</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>))*<highlight><italic>Kbt</italic></highlight>&rsqb;&plus;(UPDATE_BRAKE_HEAT&minus;BRAKE_HEAT)*<highlight><italic>K</italic></highlight>heat &emsp;&emsp;(1) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> where Kbt is a brake torque constant, UPDATE_BRAKE_HEAT is the estimated brake temperature when the characterization table was last updated, BRAKE_HEAT is a current estimate of the brake temperature, and Kheat is a constant for converting the quantity (UPDATE_BRAKE_HEAT&minus;BRAKE_HEAT) to a corresponding difference in brake torque. Thus, the brake torque obtained from the characterization table is compensated for differences in brake temperature; for example, BRAKE_TQ is reduced if BRAKE_HEAT is higher than UPDATE_BRAKE_HEAT, and vice-versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The brake temperature term BRAKE_HEAT can be modeled reasonably well, and is continuously updated regardless of whether the brakes are activated. For example, BRAKE_HEAT may be estimated as: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>BRAKE_HEAT&equals;BRAKE_HEAT&minus;((<highlight><italic>VSPD&plus;K</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight><highlight><italic>*K</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>)* (BRAKE_HEAT&minus;(BRAKE_HEAT*<highlight><italic>Tamb</italic></highlight>)&plus;(BRAKE<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>TQ*K</italic></highlight>heat*<highlight><italic>VSPD</italic></highlight>)*(<highlight><italic>K</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&minus;BRAKE_HEAT)/<highlight><italic>K</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> &emsp;&emsp;(2) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> where K<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, K<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and K<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are constants, Tamb is the ambient temperature, and VSPD is the vehicle speed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Since changes in the vehicle weight change the characterization table data, the vehicle weight is updated each time the braking characterization table is updated, according to: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>V</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>WT&equals;V</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>WT</italic></highlight>(last)&plus;<highlight><italic>WT</italic></highlight>_DELTA &emsp;&emsp;(3) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> where WT_DELTA is a measure of the change in characterization data, compensated for changes in brake temperature. Specifically, WT_DELTA is given by the expression: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>WT</italic></highlight>_DELTA&equals;&lsqb;(((<highlight><italic>PPCUR</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>old&minus;<highlight><italic>PPCUR</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>old)&minus;(<highlight><italic>PPCUR</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&minus;<highlight><italic>PPCUR</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>))/(<highlight><italic>D</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&minus;<highlight><italic>D</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>))*<highlight><italic>Kwt</italic></highlight>&rsqb;&plus;(UPDATE_BRAKE_HEAT&minus;BRAKE_HEAT)*<highlight><italic>K</italic></highlight>heat &emsp;&emsp;(4) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> where Kwt is a weight constant. In turn, the coefficient of friction between the vehicle tires and the road surface (SURFACE_MU) is given by: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>SURFACE<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>MU</italic></highlight>&equals;(BRAKE<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>TQ/V</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>WT</italic></highlight>)*<highlight><italic>Kmu </italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(5) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> where Kmu is a constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, the above information is used along with the brake pedal release rate to define adaptive exit criteria that reduce the ABS exit delay, consistent with SURFACE_MU, when the brake pedal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is only partially released. In one aspect of the invention, the exit time interval is adaptively adjusted based on SURFACE_MU, and a control value (ABS_COMMAND) used to determine if ABS control should be exited is adaptively biased toward exiting ABS control based on the brake pedal release rate and BRAKE_TQ. In another aspect of the invention, ABS control is exited independent of the timer when ABS_COMMAND indicates that ABS control should be exited and the brake pedal release rate exceeds a threshold, provided the vehicle deceleration is higher than expected, based on SURFACE_MU. In another aspect of the invention, the ABS control is exited independent of the timer when ABS_COMMAND indicates that ABS control should be exited and BRAKE TQ is significantly less than the maximum possible brake torque, given SURFACE_MU. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The method of the invention is illustrated by the flow diagram of FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, which represents a software routine periodically executed by control unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The routine serves to collect the braking system characterization data, to update the estimated brake torque BRAKE TQ and road surface coefficient of friction SURFACE_MU, and once ABS control has been initiated, to determine if the adaptive exit criteria are met. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the input processing blocks <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> are first executed to read the brake pedal position PP and the wheel speeds (WS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-WS<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>), to compute the vehicle acceleration ACCEL (compensated for road grade and vehicle weight) and wheel slip, and to update BRAKE_HEAT using equation (2). Also, the vehicle acceleration when the brake pedal is initially depressed is saved as the onset acceleration ACCEL_ONSET. Block <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> then checks the ABS FLAG to determine if ABS control is active. Ordinarily, the ABS FLAG is FALSE, and a portion of the routine comprising the blocks <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is executed to collect braking system characterization data. If insipient wheel lock has been detected, and the modulators <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> have been activated to release brake pressure, the ABS FLAG will be TRUE; in this case, the data collection portion of the routine is skipped, and the block <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is executed to determine the value of ABS_COMMAND, as explained below. If block <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is answered in the negative, the data collection portion of the routine (blocks <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>) is executed to detect the presence of braking activity that is suitable for brake system characterization. Block <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> determines if ACCEL exceeds a relatively high threshold acceleration Kaccel, block <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> determines if the previous pedal position PPold is greater than the current value PP, block <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> determines if the difference (PP-PPold) exceeds a threshold rate Krate, and block <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> determines if the difference (ACCEL-ACCEL_ONSET) is less than the minimum deceleration table entry D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Each of the blocks <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> must be answered in the negative to proceed with data collection; thus, a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; braking condition is defined as one in which (1) ACCEL&lt;Kaccel, (2) PPold&lt;PP, (3) PP-PPold&lt;Krate, and (4) ACCEL-ACCEL_ONSET&gt;D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Stated oppositely, &ldquo;normal&rdquo; braking for purposes of data collection does not include (1) panic braking, (2) high rate brake pedal movement, (3) brake pedal releasing, or (4) deceleration below the linear range of the deceleration vs. pedal position relationship. If at least one of the blocks <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is answered in the affirmative, the blocks <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are skipped, and the control unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> proceeds to block <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, as indicated by the circled letter B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The data collection blocks <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> identify the brake pedal positions P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> corresponding to the respective predefined vehicle deceleration values D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, and periodically update a brake system characterization table corresponding to the graph of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. The blocks <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> respectively determine if the pedal positions P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> have been identified, based on the status of the D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> FLAG, the D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> FLAG and the D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> FLAG. If block <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> determines that the D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> FLAG is not true, the block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> determines if the difference (ACCEL-ACCEL_ONSET) has reached the predefined deceleration value identified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> as D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. If not, the data collection portion of the routine is exited; if so, the block <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> sets the D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> FLAG to true, and uses the current value of PP to update the pedal position variable P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> as shown. On the next execution of the routine, block <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> will be answered in the affirmative, and block <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> will determine if the D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> FLAG is true. If not, the block <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> determines if the difference (ACCEL-ACCEL_ONSET) has reached the predefined deceleration value identified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> as D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. If not, the data collection portion of the routine is exited; if so, the block <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> sets the D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> FLAG to true, and uses the current value of PP to update the pedal position variable P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown. On the next execution of the routine, blocks <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> will both be answered in the affirmative, and block <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> will determine if the D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> FLAG is true. If not, the block <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> determines if the difference (ACCEL-ACCEL_ONSET) has reached the predefined deceleration value identified in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> as D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. If not, the data collection portion of the routine is exited; if so, the block <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> sets the D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> FLAG to true, uses the current value of PP to update the pedal position variable P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, increments a brake event counter BEC CTR, and sums the pedal position variables P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> with corresponding position summation values PS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, PS<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and PS<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. However, if the difference (ACCEL-ACCEL_ONSET) for the braking event fails to reach the deceleration value D<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the block <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is not executed, and any pedal position data collected during the respective brake application is discarded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> After each successful data collection, the block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> compares the brake event counter BEC_CTR to a calibrated threshold K_BEC indicative of the number of braking events needed to update the braking system characterization table. Thus, when BEC_CTR reaches K_BEC, the identified pedal position variables P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> for K_BEC (which may have a value of ten, for example) braking events will have been accumulated in the respective position summation values PS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, PS<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, PS<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. When this happens, the block <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> re-calculates the braking system characterization table values PPCUR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, PPCUR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, PPCUR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by dividing the respective pedal position summation values PS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, PS<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, PS<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> by the brake event counter BEC_CTR. In other words, PPCUR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>&equals;PS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/BEC_CTR, PPCUR<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>&equals;PS<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/BEC_CTR and PPCUR<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&equals;PS<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>/BEC_CTR. Block <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> also saves the old table values for updating V_WT, stores the current value of BRAKE_HEAT as UPDATE_BRAKE_HEAT, and resets the brake event counter BEC_CTR and the position summation values PS<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, PS<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, PS<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to zero. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Once the data collection portion of the routine has been completed or exited, the block <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> is executed to determine if the brake pedal position PP is at least as great as the lowest characterization value PPCUR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. If not, the block <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> skipped; if so, the block <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> is executed to update BRAKE_TQ and SURFACE_MU. The brake torque BRAKE_TQ is determined using equation (1), the vehicle weight V_WT is updated using equations (3) and (4), and SURFACE_MU is estimated using equation (5). Block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> then checks for insipient wheel lock. If insipient wheel lock is not detected, the routine is exited; if insipient wheel lock is detected, the block <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> sets the ABS FLAG to TRUE, and the block <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> determines the value of ABS_COMMAND. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In a conventional ABS system, ABS_COMMAND is determined by table look-up as a function of vehicle deceleration and wheel slip as described above in reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. For operating points in Region I, ABS_COMMAND indicates that ABS control should be exited; for operating points in Region II, ABS_COMMAND indicates that the respective brake pressure should be increased, decreased or maintained at the current value. In most applications, ABS_COMMAND values for different combinations of deceleration and wheel slip are stored as digital numbers, with the magnitude of the numbers corresponding to the commanded action. For example, if the retrieved value of ABS_COMMAND is less than a relatively low threshold, it indicates that ABS control should be exited; if ABS_COMMAND is in successively higher ranges, it indicates a rate at which the respective brake pressure should be decreased, that the respective pressure should be maintained, or a rate at which the respective pressure should be increased. According to this invention, however, the ABS_COMMAND value retrieved from the table is reduced as a function of the brake release rate BRR, and BRAKE_TQ whenever BRR is greater than zero, as indicated at block <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, this is achieved with the expression: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>ABS</italic></highlight>_COMMAND&equals;<highlight><italic>ABS</italic></highlight>_COMMAND<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>R</italic></highlight>&minus;(<highlight><italic>BRR</italic></highlight>*BRAKE<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>TQ</italic></highlight>) &emsp;&emsp;(6) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> a where ABS_COMMAND_R is the ABS Command value retrieved from the deceleration vs. wheel slip look-up table. In the above expression, BRR cannot have a negative value, and ABS COMMAND&equals;ABS_COMMAND_R when brake pedal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is not being released. However, when the brake pedal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is being released, ABS_COMMAND is reduced as a function of both BRR and BRAKE_TQ, thereby biasing ABS_COMMAND toward less aggressive ABS control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the control unit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> then executes block <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> to determine if ABS_COMMAND indicates that ABS control should be exited. If not, the blocks <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> are exited to determine the exit time interval TIME_EXIT and to carry out a conventional ABS control algorithm based on the ABS_COMMAND determined at block <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. The exit time interval TIME_EXIT is utilized when the ABS_COMMAND indicates that ABS control should be exited&mdash;that is, when block <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is answered in the affirmative. As indicated at block <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, TIME_EXIT is computed using the expression: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>TIME_EXIT&equals;<highlight><italic>K</italic></highlight>exit*(1&minus;SURFACE<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>MU</italic></highlight>) &emsp;&emsp;(7) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> where Kexit is a relatively long time interval that would be appropriate for a very low road surface coefficient of friction. As the estimated road surface coefficient of friction SURFACE_MU increases, however, the computed value of TIME_EXIT decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> When block <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> determines that ABS_COMMAND indicates that ABS control should be exited, the blocks <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> are executed to determine how quickly ABS control should be exited. If the brake release rate BRR is relatively high, as determined at block <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>, the blocks <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are executed to determine if the actual vehicle deceleration exceeds the vehicle deceleration ACCEL_DES desired by the driver. Block <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> determines ACCEL_DES by using the brake system characterization table to determine the desired brake torque BRAKE_TQ_DES, compensated for vehicle weight V_WT, and then converting BRAKE_TQ_DES to a corresponding desired vehicle deceleration ACCEL_DES. In the illustrated embodiment, BRAKE_TQ_DES is determined according to the expression </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>BRAKE<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>TQ</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>DES</italic></highlight>&equals;&lsqb;((<highlight><italic>PP&minus;BRR&minus;PPCUR</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)*(<highlight><italic>PPCUR</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&minus;<highlight><italic>PPCUR</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>)/(<highlight><italic>D</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>&minus;<highlight><italic>D</italic></highlight><highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>))*<highlight><italic>Kbt</italic></highlight>&rsqb;&plus;(UPDATE_BRAKE_HEAT&minus;BRAKE_HEAT)*<highlight><italic>K</italic></highlight>heat &emsp;&emsp;(8) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> provided that the difference (PP-BRR) exceeds the lowest pedal position table value PPCUR<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Reducing the pedal position PP by the release rate BRR causes BRAKE_TQ_DES to lead or anticipate BRAKE_TQ based on driver intent. The desired deceleration, in turn, is given by: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>ACCEL</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>DES&equals;</italic></highlight>BRAKE<highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>TQ</italic></highlight><highlight><subscript>&mdash;</subscript></highlight><highlight><italic>DES*Kd </italic></highlight>&emsp;&emsp;(9) </in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> where Kd is a deceleration constant. If the actual acceleration ACCEL exceeds ACCEL_DES by more than a reference amount Kdd, the block <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is answered in the affirmative, and the block <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is executed to exit ABS control by setting the ABS FLAG to FALSE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> If the brake release rate BRR is less than Kbrr, or ACCEL&lt;&equals;ACCEL_DES, the blocks <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> are exited to decrement the exit time interval TIME_EXIT and to check if TIME_EXIT has reached zero. Once TIME_EXIT reaches zero, block <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is answered in the affirmative, and block <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> is executed to exit ABS control by setting the ABS FLAG to FALSE. Otherwise, the block <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> is executed to determine if the BRAKE_TQ, compensated for the estimated vehicle weight V_WT, is significantly less than the maximum possible brake torque, given the estimated road surface coefficient of friction SURFACE_MU. Thus, block <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> compares (BRAKE_TQ/V_WT) to (SURFACE_MU*Kmbt), where Kmbt is the maximum brake torque achievable on a high road surface coefficient of friction. If the quantity (BRAKE TQ/V_WT) exceeds the product (SURFACE_MU*Kmbt) by at least at release constant Krel, block <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> will be answered in the affirmative, and block <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> will be executed to exit ABS control by setting the ABS FLAG to FALSE. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In summary, the control of this invention provides a reliable and cost-effective way of adaptively adjusting the exit criteria for an ABS system based on the brake pedal release rate and brake system characterization data to reduce the ABS exit delay when the brake pedal <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is only partially released. The ABS control term ABS_COMMAND is adaptively adjusted based on BRAKE_TQ and BRR, and TIME_EXIT is adaptively adjusted based on SURFACE_MU. The ABS control is exited if ABS_COMMAND indicates that ABS control should be exited for at least TIME_EXIT, or before the TIME_EXIT elapses if (1) BRR exceeds a threshold and the vehicle deceleration is higher than the desired deceleration, or (2) if BRAKE_TQ is significantly less than the maximum possible brake torque, given SURFACE_MU. While the brake system characterization table is depicted as being developed for purposes of estimating BRAKE_TQ and SURFACE_MU, for example, it may be also be advantageously used for diagnosing brake system abnormalities. While described in reference to the illustrated embodiment, it is expected that various modifications in addition to those mentioned above will occur to those skilled in the art. For example, the control is applicable to other types of ABS systems, and other types of vehicles, including electric or hybrid vehicles that utilize electric or regenerative braking to decelerate the vehicle. Thus, it will be understood that the scope of this invention is not limited to the illustrated embodiment, and that control methods incorporating these and other modifications may fall within the scope of this invention, which is defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
