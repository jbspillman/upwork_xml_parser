<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Wiring layers through that come into direct contact with an electrode of a ferroelectric capacitor provide a wiring layer structure configured so that the characteristic of the ferroelectric substance is not degraded by production of a reducing agent. One of coating layers through is provided on the periphery of the Al main wiring layer. A single Ti film or TiN film or a combination of both is used as the coating film. The TiN film suppresses reaction between water and aluminum. The Ti film occludes hydrogen. Therefore, the coating layer provided on the periphery of the Al wiring layer inhibits water or molecular hydrogen from entering the Al wiring layer from the outside and therefore there is no degradation of the characteristics of the ferroelectric capacitor. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a semiconductor storage element that uses a ferroelectric substance, and more particularly to a wiring layer structure for a ferroelectric capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Ferroelectric storage that uses ferroelectric material as the material for the capacitor is now reaching a stage for practical use as a type of non-volatile device. It is expected that memory devices equipped with ferroelectric capacitors will require low voltage, will have low power consumption, and will operate at high speeds because of the characteristics of this ferroelectric material. However, solutions to a number of problems are required before capacitor configurations that include ferroelectric materials can be applied in conventional semiconductor devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> One of these problems is the degradation of the characteristics of thin ferroelectric films by hydrogen. Many of the ferroelectric materials that have been examined for application in memory are oxides of a multiplicity of elements. Typical such metal oxide materials include SrBi<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Ta<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>9 </subscript></highlight>(abbreviated to SBT), and Pb(Zr, Ti) O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. After formation of a ferroelectric capacitor configuration using these materials, if activated hydrogen (hydrogen radical: H*) or molecular hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) is activated during the processes that complete a semiconductor device, these hydrogen radicals reduce the oxygen in the ferroelectric material and therefore the oxygen in the thin ferroelectric film. This reduction causes degradation of the characteristics of the ferroelectric material in the thin ferroelectric film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> One method used to combat this degradation in characteristics is recovery annealing in oxygen at a temperature at which the ferroelectric substance crystallizes, that is at a temperature between 700&deg; C. and 800&deg; C. Another method used is the formation of a barrier metal around the capacitor structure itself to prevent the infiltration (or entering) of activated hydrogen or molecular hydrogen into the thin ferroelectric film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, when semiconductor devices that include these memory devices are integrated or consolidated, a process to form wiring that is connected to the capacitor of the memory device is implemented. This wiring material is usually aluminum. Therefore, after the capacitor structure is formed, annealing at temperatures of 700&deg; C. and above, as described above, cannot occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Also, for example, Document 1, <highlight><italic>Densijouhou Tuusin Gakkai Ronbunsi C Vol. J</italic></highlight>83-<highlight><italic>C No. </italic></highlight>1 <highlight><italic>pp. </italic></highlight>53-59 (2000), discloses an example in which aluminum (Al) wiring is formed in the capacitor structure and an inter-layer insulation film, made of an ozone TEOS film (oxide film) is formed on the upper side of this wiring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The document points out that: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> (a) The ozone TEOS film produces large quantities of moisture; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> (b) The moisture produced produces hydrogen when it oxidizes the Al; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> (c) This hydrogen degrades the characteristics of the thin ferroelectric layer; and </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="1"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> (d) This degradation can be reduced by using a TiN (titanium nitride) layer on the Al wiring substrate since the addition of this TiN causes less hydrogen to be produced than when Al alone is used. This is because TiN oxidizes more than Al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Also, Document 2, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No: 10-177991, discloses a semiconductor device configured so that the Al or Al radical alloy wiring layer, formed on a titanium nitride (TiN) film, which is the barrier metal, does not corrode. According to this Document 2, ion sputtering of this insulation film is carried out on the side wall of a wiring structure created by laminating layers of titanium nitride, Al or an Al radical alloy, and titanium nitride on this insulation film, which is made for example from silicon dioxide. This forms a corrosion protection film (sputter material film) that prevents infiltration (or entering) of moisture from the outside onto the Al or Al radical alloy. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> However, neither Document 1 nor Document 2 disclose or suggest a wiring layer structure or formation method thereof that can be applied in a wiring layer (or interconnection layer) that comes into direct contact with the electrodes of the ferroelectric capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there has been a demand for some means of preventing the degradation of the characteristics of a thin ferroelectric film caused by the wiring after such contact wiring is formed. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A first object of the present invention is to provide a wiring layer structure configured so that the wiring layer does not damage the thin ferroelectric film in the ferroelectric capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> A second object of the present invention is to provide a wiring layer structure configured so that the wiring layer that comes into direct contact with the electrodes on a ferroelectric capacitor does not produce a reducing agent that will degrade the characteristics of the ferroelectric substance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> To achieve these objects, the wiring layer structure of the present invention shall be a laminated structure in which a main wiring layer formed from a first material is surrounded on the outside by a coating layer formed from a second material. This laminated structure shall be provided at least in the wiring layer part of the wiring layer structure that comes into contact with one electrode in the ferroelectric capacitor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> This first material shall be a material, preferably aluminum (Al), that reacts with a substance that infiltrates (or enters) from the outside into the main wiring layer and produces a reducing agent. This first material shall be used to configure a wiring layer that is electrically continuous from the capacitor electrode and it shall therefore be, of course, electrically conductive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The second material shall be an electrically conductive material, preferably titanium (Ti) or titanium nitride (TiN), that can prevent the infiltration (or entering) of a substance that causes the reaction as described above from the outside. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A laminated structure created from layers of these first and second materials will prevent water molecules (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) or molecular hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) from infiltration (or entering) into the main aluminum wiring layer. Therefore, a reducing agent is not produced in the aluminum. Accordingly, because there is no risk of infiltration of a reducing agent from the wiring layer into the capacitor, the ferroelectric substance within the capacitor is not damaged and its characteristics are not degraded.</paragraph>

The diagrams simply overview the size and shape of, and positional relationships between components so that the present invention can be understood. Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to the examples shown in the diagrams. Also, the materials, numerical conditions, and process conditions explained below are merely examples, and the present invention is not limited to these conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Explanation of the Wiring Configuration </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</cross-reference> are cross-sections that show configuration examples that correspond to first through fourth embodiments of the wiring layer structure of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In all the configuration examples shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</cross-reference>, the wiring layer structures <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, come into contact with an electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the ferroelectric capacitor. The wiring layer is also called as an interconnection layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The wiring layer structures <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> each comprise a main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a coating layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> that surrounds the outer periphery of the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a first material that produces a reducing agent that reacts with a substance that infiltrates (or enters) from the outside into this main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Also, each of the coating layers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is made from a second material that prevents the infiltration (or entering) of a substance that infiltrates from the outside into the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The first and second materials are conductive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Typical examples of substances that can be expected to infiltrate from the outside into the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are water (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O) and hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). Also, typical examples of reducing agents are the hydrogen radical (H*) and hydrogen (H<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> It is preferable to use aluminum (Al) as the first material. It is preferable to use titanium nitride (TiN) and/or titanium (Ti) as the second material. TiN is ideal because it prevents any reaction between water and aluminum. On the other hand, Ti has a hydrogen occlusion property and so is ideal for use as a hydrogen barrier layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> These coating layers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are formed on the surface of those parts of wiring layer structures <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> that come into contact with at least electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. These parts are areas within the main wiring layer in which the reducing agent that is likely to be produced in the main wiring layer could affect the electrode. Accordingly, the part within the main wiring layer up to which the coating layer is provided is determined as appropriate in accordance with the design. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Usually, the cross-sectional form of the contact part of this main wiring layer is basically that of the letter T. The cross-sectional form of the part that extends to the interlayer insulation film is basically rectangular. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The coating layers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> comprise: a first coating part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provided between the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>; a second coating part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, provided on the surface of the side opposite the ferroelectric capacitor of this main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>; and a third coating part <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> provided on the side surface of this main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The coating layers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can be of any thickness to suit the design of each of the embodiments. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Configuration examples for the first through fourth embodiments of the present invention will be explained below, in order, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</cross-reference>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 4</cross-reference> are all cross-sections and in all, the contact hole part has been omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Configuration of a First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Firstly, a first embodiment of the present invention will be explained. In the wiring layer structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for the first embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is formed on the upper side of one electrode (this shall be the first electrode) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a ferroelectric capacitor. This main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is an aluminum (Al) wiring layer. A coating layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is provided on the outer periphery of this aluminum wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> This coating layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has first, second, and third coating parts. The first coating part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is the part that lies between the part provided on the bottom surface of the aluminum wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, that is the aluminum wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and the first electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The second coating part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is the part provided on the surface of the side opposite the first electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the part provided on the top surface of the aluminum wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, that is the aluminum wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The third coating layer <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is the part provided on the side surface of the aluminum wiring layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In this configuration example for the first embodiment, the first, second, and third coating parts are configured using a TiN film. In particular, the first coating part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a TiN film formed using the sputtering technique. The second and third coating parts <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are TiN films formed using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In the configuration of the first embodiment described above, the surface of the aluminum wiring layer is coated with a TiN film. Therefore, this TiN film can prevent any reaction between water or molecular hydrogen and the surface of the aluminum wiring layer. Accordingly, no reducing agent is produced in the aluminum wiring layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Configuration of a Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be explained. The wiring layer structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the second embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> differs from the structure of the wiring layer of the first embodiment in that a coating layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is provided on the outer periphery of the aluminum wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The second coating part <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of this coating layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is different to the second coating part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the coating layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The second coating part <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> in this second embodiment is a TiN film formed using the sputtering technique. Other parts are the same as those shown in the configuration example for the first embodiment and so explanation of these will be omitted here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> In the configuration of the second embodiment as described above, the surface of the aluminum wiring layer is coated with a TiN film. Therefore, this TiN film can prevent any reaction between water or molecular hydrogen and the surface of the aluminum wiring layer. Accordingly, no reducing agent is produced in the aluminum wiring layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Configuration of a Third Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Next, a third embodiment of the present invention will be explained. The wiring layer structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> of the third embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> differs from the wiring layer structures of the first and second embodiments in that a coating layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which includes a Ti film that occludes hydrogen on the upper surface of the aluminum wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is provided on the outer periphery of the wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The second coating part <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of this coating layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is different to the second coating parts <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of coating layers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The second coating part <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in this third embodiment, is of a built-up layer structure with two layers: a first sub-coating part <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a second sub-coating part <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The lower layer (the base layer) formed on the upper surface of the aluminum wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, that is the first sub-coating part <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, is a Ti film formed using the sputtering technique. The upper layer, that is the second sub-coating part <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, is a TiN film formed using the sputtering technique. Other elements of the configuration are the same as those in the first and second embodiments and so explanation of these will be omitted here. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> In the configuration of the third embodiment described above, the surface of the aluminum wiring layer is coated with a TiN film. This TiN film can prevent any reaction between water or molecular hydrogen and the surface of the aluminum wiring layer. Also, the upper side of the aluminum wiring layer is also coated with a Ti film and this can prevent any reaction between hydrogen and the surface of the aluminum wiring layer. Accordingly, a reducing agent is not produced in the aluminum wiring layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> Configuration of a Fourth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Next, a fourth embodiment of the present invention will be explained. The wiring layer structure <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> of the fourth embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> differs from the wiring layer structures of the first, second, and third embodiments in that a coating layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, which includes a Ti film, is provided on both the upper and side surfaces of the aluminum wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The second coating part <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of this coating layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is configured in the same way as in the third embodiment but is different to the second coating part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of the coating layers <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in the first and second embodiments. Being a two-layer built-up film structure, the third coating part <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of this fourth embodiment differs from the single layer structure of the third coating part <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in the first, second, and third embodiments. This third coating part <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> comprises: the inside layer formed on the side surface of the aluminum wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, that is a third sub-coating part <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>; and an outside layer formed on the top side of this inside layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, that is a fourth sub-coating part <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> In the configuration example for this fourth embodiment, the fact that the main wiring layer is coated by a Ti film is different to the configuration for the third embodiment. That is, in this configuration example, the inside layer in the configuration of the third embodiment is a Ti film formed using CVD, and the outside layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is a TiN film formed using CVD. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> In the configuration of the fourth embodiment described above, the surface of the aluminum wiring layer is coated with a TiN film. Therefore, this TiN can prevent any reaction between water or molecular hydrogen and the surface of the aluminum wiring layer. Also, the upper and side surfaces, but not the bottom surface, of the aluminum wiring layer are also coated with Ti film and so this can prevent reaction between water and the surface of the aluminum wiring layer. Accordingly, any production of a reducing agent within the aluminum wiring layer can be inhibited more completely than in the third embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Explanation of Forming Methods for Wiring Layer Structures </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Next, the forming methods for the wiring configurations for the present invention will be explained with reference to the process drawings shown as cross-sections in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 through 8</cross-reference>. Note that in these diagrams, hatching to show that the diagrams are cross-sections is omitted. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>(A), <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>(A), and <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(A) each show the structure in which the ferroelectric capacitor for starting this process is formed. This structure is formed before the procedure for forming this wiring layer structure is started. That is, the ferroelectric capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is formed on the substrate <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, on which the desired semiconductor area will be formed, using an appropriate conventional method. The electrode on the substrate side of the ferroelectric capacitor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (hereinafter referred to as the second electrode) is shown as <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the ferroelectric material, that is the ferroelectric layer, is shown as <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. In the embodiments explained below, platinum (Pt) is used as the material for the first and second electrodes <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and SBT is used as the ferroelectric material <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. However, these materials are not restricted to those described here. The interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can be formed of any suitable material. This preparation is the same for all the configuration examples shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 8</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Forming Method for the Configuration of the First Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> Firstly, the method for forming the wiring layer structure for the first embodiment described above will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>(A) through <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>(G). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> In this forming method, the first and second resist patterns are formed using different light exposures but the same resist material. These resist patterns are used as etching masks and a coating film is formed on the required outside surfaces of the main wiring layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> In the first process, firstly a first built-up layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(D)) from the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a first coating part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> on the surface of the side opposite the ferroelectric layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the first electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> Next, in the second process, a second coating part is formed on the surface of the side opposite the first coating part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the first built-up layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. In addition, a third coating part is formed on the side surface of the first built-up layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The first, second, and third coating parts <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> thus formed are joined together to form the coating layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that coats the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(G)) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In this first process, the following first through fourth sub-processes are implemented to form this main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the coating layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that coats it. Furthermore, in the second process, the following fifth through seventh sub-processes are implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> Firstly, a preferable example of the first process will be explained. In the first sub-process, an interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, on which contact holes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for exposing part of the first electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are provided, is formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(A)). In this embodiment too, the commonly used TEOS film is formed as this interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Here, in a preferable example, a laminated film is formed with a 100 nm thick O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-TEOS layer and a 300 nm thick P-TEOS layer. The conditions for the formation of these films are as described below. The conditions required for the O<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>-TEOS film are: TEOS flow rate of 2 SLM (&equals;2,000 sccm); an O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>concentration of 25 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>; and a temperature of 400&deg; C. The conditions required for the P-TEOS film are: a TEOS flow rate of 240 sccm; an O<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>flow rate of 560 sccm; power of 390 W; and a temperature of 390&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Next, in the second sub-process, an auxiliary built-up layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, comprising a first auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and an auxiliary main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which are laid down sequentially, is formed on the upper side of the interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to fill in these contact holes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(B)). This first auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is, for example, formed as a titanium nitride (TiN) film using sputtering that targets TiN. Also, the auxiliary main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is, for example, formed as an aluminum (Al) film using sputtering that targets Al. In particular, this auxiliary main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, is best formed so that its upper surface is essentially flat in order to avoid unevenness in the upper surface of the wiring layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> Prefereable examples of the conditions required for this sputtering are given below. The conditions required for the TiN film are: a film depth of 50 nm; pressure of 4 mTorr (approximately 0.532 Pa); and power of 6 kW. This TiN film is formed without heating, that is at room temperature. The conditions required for the Al are: a film depth of 300 nm; pressure of 2 mTorr (approximately 0.226 Pa); power of 12 kW; and a temperature of 250&deg; C. In the formation of both the TiN and Al films, argon is used as the ion for injection in sputtering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> Next, in the third sub-process, photolithography is used to form a first resist pattern <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on the auxiliary built-up layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(C)). A preferable example of the resist material to be used here is, for example, IPI1800-9 cp (manufactured by TOKYO OHKA KOGYO CO., Ltd.) a product that is readily available on the market. Any other suitable material can be used. When using a bought resist material such as this, it is preferable that the depth of the resist film is 1,200 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> explains the exposure characteristic of resist. It shows the relationship between the resist light exposure and the pattern dimensions for the IPI1800-9 cp resist. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the horizontal axis shows the light exposure (EXP (ms)) and the vertical axis shows the pattern dimensions (R.C.D. (&mgr;m). This characteristic curve shows that large resist pattern dimensions result when the light exposure time is short and that smaller pattern dimensions result when the light exposure time is long. Note however, that here, when the light exposure is too long, the resist angles become rounded and when the light exposure is too short, a pattern cannot be formed. In later processes, in light of the fact that patterning using the same resist material will be implemented, an 800 ms light exposure is used for a 1,200 nm thick resist layer. This forms this first resist pattern <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> that has a pattern width of 1.5 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Next, the fourth sub-process is implemented. The auxiliary built-up layer <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is etched to form the first laminated layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(D)). Here, the first mask pattern <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is used as a mask and anisotropic etching of the Al film <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the TiN film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is implemented one after the other. This forms, in suitable shapes and sizes, an Al wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, as the main wiring layer, and a TiN sputter layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, as the first coating part. The first resist pattern <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is then removed in an appropriate manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Here, etching is done in a mixed atmosphere of Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and BCL<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The reason why B is included is to prevent any products of etching from adhering to the side wall of the pattern of the first built-up layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The conditions required for etching are: a BCL<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>flow rate of 60 sccm; a Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>flow rate of 90 sccm; pressure of 7 mTorr (approximately 0.931 Pa); and power of 80 W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Next, a preferable example of the second process will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> The fifth sub-process is implemented to form a second auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> on the interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that includes the first built-up layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(E)). This second auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is formed using TiN CVD. This TiN CVD film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is formed using hot CVD with a gas mixture of TiCL<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>, N<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, and NH<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The conditions for this film formation are: a film depth of 50 nm; a TiCL<highlight><subscript>4 </subscript></highlight>flow rate of 35 sccm; an N<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>flow rate of 470 sccm; an NH<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>flow rate of 400 sccm; pressure of 0.4 Torr (approximately 53.2 Pa); and a temperature of 680&deg; C. CVD is used because it is better able than sputtering to form a TiN film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of a uniform thickness on both the flat surfaces and the side surfaces (that is perpendicular surfaces) of the first built-up layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Next, the sixth sub-process is implemented to form a second resist pattern on the upper side of this first built-up layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(F)). Here, the same resist material used for the first resist pattern <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is used for a second resist pattern <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> but a resist pattern of slightly larger dimensions than the first resist pattern <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is formed. As previously explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, this second resist pattern is formed using the exposure characteristic of the resist material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> In this configuration example, this second resist pattern <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is formed so that it protrudes right up to the outside of the first built-up layer <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Therefore, in this embodiment, the resist is exposed for a short time of just 400 ms to form a wider pattern of width 1.8 &mgr;m. By thus forming a second resist pattern <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, when the film thickness of the CVD-TIN film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is 50 nm, a margin of 100 nm or more can be taken on the side surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> When forming the third coating part <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on the side wall, the stepper alignment precision that forms the second resist pattern <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is normally about 0.2 &mgr;m. Therefore, it is preferable that the above margin be at least 0.3 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> Next, the seventh sub-process is implemented to etch the TiN CVD film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, which is the second auxiliary coating layer, and to form a second and third coating part <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(G)). Etching here is done in the same way as etching for the first auxiliary coating film layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, using the second resist pattern <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. In other words, this etching is done in a mixed atmosphere of Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and BCl<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>. The conditions for this etching are: a BCl<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>flow rate of 60 sccm; a Cl<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>flow rate of 90 sccm; pressure of 7 mTorr (approximately 0.931 Pa), and power of 80 W. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> The cross-sectional structure of the wiring layer structure formed thus and shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(G) is in the shape of an upper case letter T. Although the shape is different, it has the exactly the same type of layer structure as explained in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The second resist pattern can then be removed in an appropriate manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> Thus, the wiring layer structure <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, which is connected to the electrode of the ferroelectric capacitor and which has a coating layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> around the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as required, is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the method for forming the wiring layer structure of the first embodiment of the present invention, the first resist pattern <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, formed to the required width by increasing the exposure, is used to etch and thereby form the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the first coating part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> beneath it. Next, after the TiN film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is formed, the second resist pattern <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, which is made wider by reducing the light exposure, is used to etch and thereby form the second and third coating parts <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Therefore, a TiN coating layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can be accurately formed all around any part of the Al main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that could be exposed, without necessitating a special mask for processing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> Forming Method for the Configuration of the Second Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> Next, the method for forming the wiring layer structure for the second embodiment explained above will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>(A) through (F). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> In the forming method, in the first process, a first built-up layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, comprising a first coating part <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a second coating part <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, is formed on the surface opposite the ferroelectric layer <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the first electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(D)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> Next, in the second process, a third coating part <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed on the side surface of the first built-up layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> then a coating layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which coats the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> with first, second, and third coating parts <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, is formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> To form this main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the coating layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> that coats it, the following first through fourth sub-processes are implemented in this first process. Furthermore, the following fifth and sixth sub-processes are implemented in the second process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Firstly, a preferable example of the first process will be explained. In the first sub-process, an interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with contact holes for exposing part of the first electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is formed with a TEOS film (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(A)) using the same materials and film forming conditions as in the forming method for the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0095" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0095&rsqb;</number> Next, in the second sub-process, an auxiliary built-up layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, in which a first auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, an auxiliary main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and a second auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are laid down sequentially, is formed on the top side of the interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(B)). This first auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and auxiliary main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed with the same materials and under the same film forming conditions as in the forming method for the first embodiment. Also, the second auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is a TiN sputter film and is formed using the same materials and under the same film forming conditions as used for the first auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0096" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0096&rsqb;</number> Next, in the third sub-process, the photolithography technique is used to form a first resist pattern <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on the auxiliary built-up layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(C)). The resist material used here is the same resist material as used in the forming method for the first embodiment. This first resist pattern <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is formed under photolithography conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0097" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0097&rsqb;</number> Next, the fourth sub-process is implemented to etch the auxiliary built-up layer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and form the first built-up layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(D)). Here, as in the forming method for the first embodiment, the first mask pattern <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is used as a mask to sequentially etch the TiN film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the Al film <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and the TiN film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. The TiN sputter film <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, which is the second coating part, the Al wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which is the main wiring laye, and the TiN sputter film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, which is the first coating part, are then all formed into suitable shapes and sizes. Here, the etching of the TiN films and Al film is done under the same etching conditions and using the same gas as used in the forming method for the first embodiment. The first resist pattern is then moved in an appropriate manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0098" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0098&rsqb;</number> Next, a preferable example of the second process will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0099" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0099&rsqb;</number> In the fifth sub-process, a third auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is formed on the interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that includes the first built-up layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(E)). This third auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, is formed in the same way as the second auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the forming method for the first embodiment, using TiN CVD technique and film forming conditions. In this CVD, a TiN film of uniform depth can be formed on the upper and side surfaces of the first built-up layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0100" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0100&rsqb;</number> Next, in the sixth sub-process, anisotropic etching of a third auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is done in a perpendicular direction. This exposes the top surfaces of both the second coating part <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and also forms the third coating part <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>(F)). Dry etching is used here and all surfaces are etched back from the third auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> side. The dry etching of the TiN film formed using CVD is done in the same gas environment as used in the etching of the forming method for the first embodiment and under the same etching conditions. Therefore, the third auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on the side of the first built-up layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is not removed in this etching and coating layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0101" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0101&rsqb;</number> Thus, a wiring layer structure <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, which is connected to the electrode of the ferroelectric capacitor and which has a coating layer <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> around the required parts of the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0102" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0102&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the forming method for the wiring layer structure of the second embodiment of the present invention, firstly a first built-up layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, in which TiN film is laminated above and below layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is formed. A new TiN film <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is then provided from the top of this first built-up layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> over all surfaces of the interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Dry etching of this TiN film <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is implemented to etch back all surfaces and thus obtain the wiring layer structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0103" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0103&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the TiN film is removed by etching from the upper part of the main wiring layer and from parts in surrounding areas. However, it is not removed from the part of the third auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, formed on the side of the first built-up layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in a direction perpendicular to the substrate surface. This fact enables simplification of the lithography process and means that a coating layer can be formed accurately on the required surfaces around the main wiring layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0104" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0104&rsqb;</number> Forming Method for the Configuration of the Third Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0105" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0105&rsqb;</number> Next, the forming method for the wiring layer structure of the third embodiment described above will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>(A) through (F). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0106" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0106&rsqb;</number> In this forming method, firstly, the first and second processes differ from the first and second processes explained with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> above only in part and so the sub-processes for both processes will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0107" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0107&rsqb;</number> In this first process, the following first through fourth sub-processes are implemented to form this main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the coating layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> that covers it. Furthermore, in the second process, a fifth and sixth sub-process are implemented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0108" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0108&rsqb;</number> Firstly, a preferable example of the first process will be explained. In the first sub-process, an interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, with contact holes <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> for exposing part of the first electrode <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, is formed using TEOS film and using the same materials and film forming conditions as used in the forming method for the first embodiment (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(A)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0109" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0109&rsqb;</number> Next, in the second sub-process, an auxiliary built-up layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, in which a first auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, an auxiliary main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, a first auxiliary sub-coating layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and a second auxiliary sub-coating layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are laid down sequentially, is formed on the upper side of the interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(B)). In this configuration example, a second auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed by a first auxiliary sub-coating layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and a second auxiliary sub-coating layer <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Also, in this configuration example, the first auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and auxiliary main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are formed using the same materials and under the same film forming conditions as in the forming method for the second embodiment. Also, the first auxiliary sub-coating layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed as a Ti sputter film using sputtering that targets Ti. The second auxiliary sub-coating film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is formed as a TiN film using sputtering, using the same materials and under the same film forming conditions used in the forming method for the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0110" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0110&rsqb;</number> In this configuration example, in a preferable situation, the Ti sputter film is formed under the following conditions: a film depth of 30 nm; pressure of 4 mTorr (approximately 0.532 Pa); and power of 1.5 kW. Here also, argon is used for the sputter injection ions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0111" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0111&rsqb;</number> A Ti film is formed as the first auxiliary sub-coating layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>because it adheres well and also has a hydrogen occlusion characteristic. Therefore, any hydrogen that attempts to pass through this film can be captured within the Ti film. In addition, hydrogen in the metal interlayer insulation film is believed to be another cause of degradation of the ferroelectric substance characteristic and it is therefore hoped that provision of this Ti film will shut out hydrogen from the interlayer insulation film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0112" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0112&rsqb;</number> Next, in the third sub-process, photolithography is used to form a first resist pattern <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> on the auxiliary built-up layer <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(C)). The resist material used here is the same as that used in the forming method for the first embodiment and this first resist pattern <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is formed under photolithography conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0113" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0113&rsqb;</number> Next, in the fourth sub-process, the auxiliary built-up layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is etched to form a first built-up layer <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(D)). Here also, as in the forming method for the first embodiment, the first mask pattern <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is used as a mask and a TiN film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, Ti film <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, Al film <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and TiN film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are etched sequentially. The sputter film <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, comprising the films of the first sub-coating part (Ti film) and second sub-coating part (TiN film) <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, is formed as a second coating part, an Al wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as the main wiring layer, and a TiN sputter film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as the first coating part. Each is formed to an appropriate shape and size. Here, etching of the TiN film and Al film is done in the same gas atmosphere as in the forming method for the first embodiment and under the same etching conditions. The first resist pattern is then removed in an appropriate manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0114" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0114&rsqb;</number> Next, a preferable example of the second process will be explained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0115" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0115&rsqb;</number> In the fifth sub-process, a third auxiliary coating layering <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is formed on the interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that includes the first built-up layer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(E)). As with the second auxiliary coating film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> in the forming method for the first embodiment, this third auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is formed using TiN CVD technique and film forming conditions. This CVD enables TiN film of a uniform depth to be formed on the upper and side surfaces of the first built-up layer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0116" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0116&rsqb;</number> Next, in the sixth sub-process, as in the forming method for the second embodiment, anisotropic etching of the third auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is implemented from a direction perpendicular to expose the upper surfaces of both the second coating part (TiN film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> here) <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and inter-layer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In addition, the third coating part <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is formed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(F)). The etching used here is dry etching and total surface etch back is implemented from the third auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> side. The dry etching of the TiN film using CVD is implemented in the same gas atmosphere as etching in the forming method for the first embodiment and under the same etching conditions. Therefore, the third auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> on the side of the first built-up layer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is not removed by this etching, and therefore the coating layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0117" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0117&rsqb;</number> In this way, the wiring layer structure <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, which is connected to an electrode on a ferroelectric capacitor and in which the outside of the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is coated with coating layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> as required, is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0118" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0118&rsqb;</number> Thus, in the forming method for the wiring layer structure for the third embodiment, a TiN film <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is formed on the underside of the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a laminated film comprising Ti film <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and TiN film <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is provided on the upper side of the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and a first built-up layer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is provided. A new TiN film <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> is then provided from the upper side of this first built-up layer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> over all surfaces of the interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Dry etching of this TiN film <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> etches back all surfaces to obtain the wiring layer structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0119" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0119&rsqb;</number> Therefore, the upper part of the main wiring layer and the TiN film on parts of the surrounding area are removed by etching but part of the third auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> formed on the side of the first built-up layer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the substrate is not removed. This fact means that the lithography process is simplified and a coating layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> can be properly formed around the required surfaces of the main wiring layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0120" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0120&rsqb;</number> Forming Method for the Configuration for the Fourth Embodiment </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0121" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0121&rsqb;</number> In this forming method, an outside layer is further added to the upper side of the CVD-Ti film (inside film) on the side of the wiring layer structure of the third embodiment described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0122" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0122&rsqb;</number> In the forming method for this fourth embodiment, the wiring layer structure is formed using the same processes up to the sixth sub-process of the second process in the forming method for the third embodiment described above. A wiring layer structure as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(F) is thus formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0123" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0123&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>(A) and (B) continue on from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(F) and are process drawings that accompany the explanation of the overview of the forming method for the fourth embodiment. In the forming method for this fourth embodiment, the structure in which the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and coating layer <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>(F) are combined is called the second built-up layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0124" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0124&rsqb;</number> In the forming method for this fourth embodiment, in the seventh sub-process of the second process, a fourth auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is formed on the exposed interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that includes the second built-up layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(A)). A TiN film is formed using the CVD method as this fourth auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The film forming conditions for this CVD-TIN film can be the same as those for the other CVD-TiN film <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>(E)) explained previously in the forming method for the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0125" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0125&rsqb;</number> Next, in the eighth sub-process, anisotropic etching of the fourth auxiliary coating layer <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> is implemented in a perpendicular direction. This etching exposes the second sub-coating part <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of the second coating part <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and the interlayer insulation film <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. In addition, it forms a fourth sub-coating part <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> on the side of the second built-up layer <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>(B)). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0126" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0126&rsqb;</number> Through the above processes, a third coating part <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which comprises a third sub-coating part <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a fourth sub-coating part <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, is formed and a coating layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> for this fourth embodiment is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0127" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0127&rsqb;</number> Thus, a wiring layer structure <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, which is connected to an electrode of the ferroelectric capacitor and in which a coating layer <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is provided around all required parts of the main wiring layer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, is obtained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0128" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0128&rsqb;</number> In this forming method for this fourth embodiment, lithography is simplified as it is in the forming method for the third embodiment, and a coating film <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> can be properly formed around the main wiring layer where required. </paragraph>
