<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a modular building system for freestanding screens or room dividers. Especially the invention relates to a modular building system for freestanding screens of the type used to partition space into discrete areas such as, for example, screens used for partition office space into typing bays and other work areas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Freestanding screens or room dividers are frequently formed by integral vertical panels supported vertically by a stand. Such panels may either be solid, for example particle board panels or they may comprise a front panel and a back panel having air space or filling such as insulation between them. Whether the panels are solid or spaced apart panels it is usually necessary for aesthetic purposes to provide an edging around the screen. Sometimes such edging may incorporate linking means to link adjacent panels. The front and back surfaces of such panels may be decorated by any convenient means, frequently by fabric covering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Although screens of different heights and widths may be provided by utilizing panels of different sizes, it is not possible to adjust the height of any one particular screen Moreover, although a wide variety of decorative finishing surfaces and side edging may be used, the provision of such finishes adds considerably to the cost of the article. Less importantly, if such screens are to be stored, they take up considerable storage space unless they may be disassembled from their stands. Even if it is possible to disassemble the panels from the stands, the panels must be either stacked vertically against a wall or flat on the floor. In either case considerable floor space or wall space is required for storage. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present inventor has attempted to provide a versatile building system for screens, especially those to be used to partition space, which screens may be adjustable in height and easily disassembled for reconfiguration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> According to the invention there is provided a modular building system to form at least one dissassemblable, freestanding screen, the system comprising at least two elongate supports each having an upper end and a lower end, a foot for each of the support members to hold the support member stably in a vertical position, the lower end of each support member being engagable with one of the feet; a plurality of building blocks stackable one upon another to form a screen. The stacked blocks to be threaded in vertical progression on the support members, each building block comprising a rectangular box having an open bottom and an open top. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Preferably the building blocks engage one with another by means of members upstanding from opposed inner surfaces of one building block to project into and fit against opposed inner surfaces of another building block stacked on it. The upstanding members may conveniently be formed by profiling upper and lower margins to form interengaging steps. Alternatively inner lining walls may be provided against opposed inner wall surfaces of each building block. Inner lining walls fixed to opposed inner end wall surfaces may be provided with handles to aid manipulation of the building blocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The system may include an uppermost capping member comprising a rectangular box having an open bottom and a closed top the dimensions of the capping member being such as to latch into the building block immediately below it. Preferably, the upper surface of each building block is bevelled downwardly and inwardly. When a capping member is used above one of these building blocks, the dimensions of the capping member may be such that the capping member nests in the building block supported by the bevelled surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The support members may be telescopic so that their height may be adjustable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Transverse strut members may be provided within the building blocks to provide them with some rigidity. The building blocks may also be provided with open ended sockets from top to bottom for sliding fit about the support members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> When assembling a building system according to the invention into a freestanding screen the steps may generally be as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> 1) The lower ends of two support members are engaged into corresponding feet; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> 2) If the height of the support members is adjustable these are now adjusted to the height required; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> 3) A lowermost building block is threaded onto the support members through the sockets in the building block provided for that purpose and the building block is lowered to rest on the feet; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> 4) A further building block is threaded onto the support members and lowered onto the lowermost building block; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>) Further building blocks are added until the screen has nearly reached the desired height; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> 6) The stacked building blocks are retained in the stack by means of engagement means between the uppermost building block and each of the supports; </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> 7) Finally a capping member is placed over the top end of the support to nest on the uppermost building block.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The drawings show a room dividing partition screen <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> made up of building blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and vertical supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The screen <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is a freestanding single unit as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The partition screen <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises building blocks <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> stacked to any desired height. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As may be best seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> the system may comprise, for each screen <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a pair of elongate support members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be held in a vertical position by feet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Usually a pair of support members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> with feet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is sufficient for any one screen. For example a pair of feet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will support a screen of up to 8 feet in width. If a very wide screen is desired, it may sometime be desirable to have more than two support members. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Feet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, may be of any convenient shape and size but generally extend horizontally at right angles to the plane of screen <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to give it stability in the vertical plane. Conveniently, the feet may have the form illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> being generally elliptical in plan view having a flat lower surface with the major axis of the ellipse extending horizontally at right angles to the plane of the screen. The elliptical base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may have a separate round or elliptical neck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a socket <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in an upper surface. Alternatively the base may be one piece with the neck merging into it. The socket <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is designed to mate with a lower end of one of the supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thus, if the support is of round cross section, then the socket will be of round cross section having a similar diameter. If the support is of square or of other cross section the socket will have a shape corresponding to it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, themselves, have a length generally corresponding to the desired height of the screen <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In order that the support members <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> lodge securely in sockets of building units <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in a manner to be hereinafter described, it is desirable that the outer surface of supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> be continuous. Thus, supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be supplied in different lengths according to customer requirements. Alternatively, supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be supplied in lengths considered adequate for most purposes and may be cut to shorter lengths by the customer if required. Alternatively, supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may be made telescopic but when telescopic supports are provided it may be difficult to provide a continuous outer surface of constant diameter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Each building block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may comprise a rectangular box having an open top and an open bottom. Each box may be formed of fibre board, chip board, pressed wood, wood or any other convenient material. The boxes or building units <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be assembled into the final screen <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by stacking one box upon another so that the lower edge of one box rests on the upper box of the other. Engagement means should be provided between the boxes to prevent or inhibit relative movement between them. The engagement means may be any convenient means but preferably should be provided inwardly of the boxes so as not to present any unsightly appearance on the outside. For example, as may be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</cross-reference>, the engagement means may be a rigid liner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> upstanding from an inner surface of a lower box <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to project into and position an upper box <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> immediately above it. As shown, liners <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> extend fully along both long walls <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the box <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The liner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may only extend over one pair of opposed walls as shown. Alternatively the liner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may extend over long side walls <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and over short end walls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a series of positioning pegs may extend upwardly from the inner surface of a lower box to position an upper box upon it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The liners <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> may conveniently comprise elongate boards to rest on ledges <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> projecting inwardly from inner surfaces of long walls <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The liners fit loosely against the inner surfaces of long walls <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and may be prevented from tipping inwardly by rectangular spacer plates <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extending across each box <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> between the liners <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Each spacer plate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the lowermost box <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> rests on the top edge of neck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of foot <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Each spacer plate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of boxes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> above the lowermost box rest on the spacer plate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> immediately below it. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Each spacer plate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> has an extension <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> having an axially vertical socket therethrough for the passage of elongate vertical supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Conveniently each extension <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is a horizontal plate extending from the spacer plate <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, the horizontal plate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> having an aperture <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> therethrough, the aperture corresponding in shape to the perimeter of the corresponding support <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> When the liner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> is a full liner or when it is over opposed short walls <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, it may be convenient to provide it with handles for easy manipulation of the building units or boxes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. These handles may conveniently be formed of apertures in the liner. The liner <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> itself, may be formed from a similar material, i.e. fibre board, chip board, wood, etc, as the outer structure of box <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> or it may be formed of other rigid material capable of locating one box on top of another. Other possible materials are metal sheet, plastic sheet, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Alternatively as may be seen from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, an upper margin of the outer surface of a building block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be profiled by a right angled elongate groove to provide an inwardly stepped, upwardly directed flange <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Similarly, a lower margin of a building block <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be profiled with an elongate right angled groove to provide a downwardly directed flange or skirt <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> to fit over flange <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The arrangement of notches and flanges may be such that the groove and tongue engagement between building units is achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In assembly, lower ends of supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are nested into sockets <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of feet <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and fixed firmly therein. Sockets <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may be made of distortable plastic material screwed onto foot base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by screws <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. As screws <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are tightened, neck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> tends to tighten about support <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Thereafter, a lowermost building unit or box <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is slotted onto supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through sockets <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of plates <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The lowermost box <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is slid down the supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to rest on the upper surface of neck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of foot <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The dimensions of the upper surface of neck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> should be sufficiently great to allow box <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to rest thereon. Spacer plates <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and liners <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are placed in position with socket <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of extension plate <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> about support <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Thereafter a further box <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is slotted onto supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and slid down them to rest on the upper edge of the lowermost box <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Further liners and spacer plates are added, followed by further boxes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as required. When the structure (partition screen <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>) has nearly sufficient desired height, locking clamps <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are placed on supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and tightened to hold the boxes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in position and allow the screen to be transported as a unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Finally, a cap member is placed over the upper most box <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to hide the top of supports <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the locking clamps <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The cap member is generally similar in shape to the boxes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> but may have a closed top surface <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Conveniently, each of the boxes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may have bevelled upper and lower edges <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the bevel extending downwardly and inwardly for vertical nesting engagement of adjacent boxes in a stack. The dimension of cap member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be such that the cap member rests on the bevel to nest slightly within uppermost box <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This member cap member <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, although it rests loosely on the uppermost box <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, may be retained stably in position by means of this slight nesting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The boxes may be painted or otherwise finished according to customer requirements. When not in use they may be stored in any convenient format. If stored on their sides they may even provide convenient storage capacity for other small items. </paragraph>
