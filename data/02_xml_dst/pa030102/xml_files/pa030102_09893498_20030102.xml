<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A photonic switch uses a cost-effective DWDM optimized switch architecture allowing the introduction of DWDM into the metro network. In order to implement this architecture cost-effective ways of implementing the optical carrier frequency/wavelength precision required for a Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing 100 GHz or 50 GHz on-grid solutions are needed. The photonic switch acts as an intermediary between the WDM density of the access portion of the metropolitan photonic network and the DWDM density of the core photonic network. The metro photonic switch introduces optical carriers that are all generated in the photonic layer adjacent to it and allocates them out to the photonic access nodes for modulation. This has the advantage of providing the optical carriers to be modulated from a centralized highly stable and precise source, thereby meeting the requirements for DWDM carrier precision, whilst generating these carriers in relatively close proximity to the modulators. Coarse WDM components can be used in the access portion of the network without adversely affecting the ability of the signal to transit the DWDM portion of the core network, since the optical carrier frequency is fixed at the centralized source and is unaffected by these components. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexed photonic network requires precisely controlled (in optical carrier frequency) modulated optical carriers from the customer premises for a DWDM core photonic network to be viable. In prior art solutions, all optical carriers are locally generated at the access point. If fixed optical carrier frequency lasers are used, network engineering of distribution of laser wavelengths must be mapped out on a network wide basis. Alternatively, individual tunable lasers can be used at all access points, providing greater flexibility in network engineering at a significant increase in hardware costs, and a need to introduce remote optical frequency provisioning. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is illustrated in a block diagram a photonic network capable of using an embodiment of the present invention. The metropolitan photonic network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of network nodes in the form of metropolitan photonic nodes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> providing edge node, tandem node or mixed edge/tandem node functionality which are interconnected to form an optical mesh network. The edge nodes are connected to access nodes that terminate the optical network, for example photonic edge nodes (EN) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are coupled to access nodes (AN) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> respectively, while edge nodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> are coupled to content switch <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and MPLS router <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, respectively. The photonic edge node <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the router <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> are closely coupled to form a core node <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and include a lambda converter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>. All network nodes are coupled to a network control plane <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> via links <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, which is itself coupled to a management plane <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. By way of example an Optical UNI server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is shown coupled to the management and control planes <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. These planes also interface with other applicable protocol servers as appropriate for the network configuration (e.g. Internet Protocol, Ethernet). All nodes in the core network include a contact manager (CM) <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> coupled to the control plane <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The control plane <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is implemented as a 100 bT Ethernet network using 1310 nm and coarse-WDM (true band-level coarse WDM) on inter-switch node fibers. Each switch node is associated with a small Ethernet hub/switch (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) for passing through Ethernet packet info and extracting local communications to/from local node controller and Contract Manager. Each edge node <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a multi-lambda carrier source <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In operation, network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, when implementing an embodiment of the present invention, provides network end-to-end transport based upon the allocation of optical carriers of specific wavelengths and implement the distribution of the appropriate optical carriers to achieve the required end-to-end wavelength path connection across the network. Access node &num;X (or router &num;Y) requests a cross-network path by sending a request to the photonic network control plane, specifically the O-UNI, via links <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The control-plane passes the requests to the O-UNI server, which establishes the validity of the request and the locations of the optical path end points for the optical path to be set up or taken down, as well as any GoS, QoS constraints. The O-UNI, via the control plane, notifies the Contract Managers (CM&apos;s) at the individual edge nodes and tandem nodes either the required end-to-end path and lets them collaborate to find one (the optical network controller (ONC), Contract Manager model as described in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/453,282 entitled &ldquo;Architectures for Communications Networks&rdquo;, filed on Dec. 3, 1999 assigned to the Assignee of the present invention.) or the management/control plane determines an available end-to-end path, including cross-connections in the edge nodes and lambdas to use, and notifies the affected nodes. The edge nodes then set up the correct connections and the adjacent lambda source feeds the correct lambda to the access node &num;X. The access does not need to know what wavelength it is using, since this is managed within the network to ensure appropriate photonic connectivity. Once complete the access node is notified that its lambda-path is in place. For the access nodes, links <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>f</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>g</italic></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>service (lambda) requests to O-UNI and returns notification of grants of lambda requests. For the photonic nodes, links <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>handle end-to-end bandwidth requests (lambda) from O-UNI <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to CM <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Inter-CM communications are used to establish the components of the end-to-end path. Upon path establishment, confirmation of path is sent to O-UNI <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> from CM<highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The optical carrier to be modulated is provided as a clean unmodulated optical carrier from a local source, co-located with the edge node, along with the downstream data on a separate optical carrier of a different optical frequency which originates at the far end of the network path. There may be some co-ordination between the optical carriers to simplify the provisioning process, e.g. odd lambda downstream data-stream is associated with the next highest lambda for the upstream data (and hence downstream optical unmodulated carrier) or even lambda downstream gets next lower odd lambda upstream, which allows all lambdas to be used. In addition the multi-lambda carrier sources associated with each switch node can be synchronized to a master optical carrier, generated in one of the Multi-lambda sources (MLS). This is described in more detail, especially with respect to the implementation of the MLS, MLS synchronization technique in co-pending application filed Jun. 1, 2001, Ser. No. 60/294,919; hereinafter referred to as (MLS synch). For example, for the purpose of synchronization, a designated master multi-lambda carrier source <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, associated with EN<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, generates a reference lambda carrier <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, which is sent to all remaining multi-lambda carrier sources in the network, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>going to the multi-lambda carrier source <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>going to multi-lambda carrier sources <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. These multi-lambda carrier sources then generate their multi-lambda carriers with reference to carrier <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. For example, the multi-lambda carrier source <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of edge node <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> generates a carrier <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which is output to AN<highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, where it is modulated and returned to the network via <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> until it terminates on router <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Meanwhile the multi-lambda carrier source <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of edge node <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> generates a carrier <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which it outputs to router <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, which modulates it, returns it to the network via <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to terminate on <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, thereby completing the bidirectional path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The detailed structure of the switch edge-facing or access-facing port card depends upon the actual wavelength allocation methodology, and the required network and hence node functionality, but all approaches use the method of providing the originating optical carrier at a specific wavelength as laid out herein. The control plane <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and management plane <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> both couple across to the Ethernet control, management planes as well as to the Optical UNI server <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> (Optical User-Network Interface Server). The photonic network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is quasi-autonomous, and configures its wavelength paths based upon requests for end-to-end connectivity passed to the O-UNI Server. This server then notifies each node of the required new end-to-end path and the nodes co-operate to establish such a path. Methods to do this were disclosed in co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 09/453,282 entitled &ldquo;Architectures for Communications Networks&rdquo;, filed Dec. 3, 1999, referred to herein after as (Graves Hobbs 1999). Such operation permits simplification in layer <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>) network topology by permitting reconfigurable bypass and cost effective access to centralized network L<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and L<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> resource. An end-to-end lambda provisioned photonic network greatly reduces component count seen in opto-electronic hybrid networks. For example in traversing the network of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> from access node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to access node <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> (or any other nodes e.g. <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>), there are only two optical transmitters and two optical receivers over the entire path, down from 8 of network nodes with electrical switching cores were used. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The photonic network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> implementing an embodiment of the present invention uses a cost-effective DWDM optimized switch architecture, which provides the opportunity to introduce both enormous growth and bandwidth-carrying capacity of DWDM into the metro network. In order to implement this architecture we need to provide cost-effective ways of implementing the optical carriers with the frequency or wavelength precision required for a 100 GHz or even 50 GHz on-grid DWDM solution. This has two aspects, one being the precision of the DWDM (dense wavelength division multiplexing), DWDD (dense wavelength division demultiplexing) actual multiplexing, demultiplexing elements and the other being the precision generation of the optical carriers themselves, since these optical carriers have to be centered in the passbands of the individual DWDM channels, if their modulation sidebands are to pass through the DWDM path without significant impairment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> DWDM multiplexers and demultiplexers are rapidly falling in cost and complexity as Array Waveguide technology matures to the point of offering adequate performance. This technology results in a single chip monolithic part that can be manufactured using a silicon wafer processing plant and techniques. Furthermore such parts exhibit accuracies to a few GHz in commercially available devices, making 50 GHz and 100 GHz DWDM applications of this technology highly viable. Such parts often have relatively flat passbands of about &plus;/&minus;12-20 GHz either side of their center frequency. Given that the modulation sidebands may extend out &minus;10 GHz either side of the carrier, this leaves little margin for the combined effects of DWDM filter drift and optical carrier frequency drift, leading to a requirement for a very precise and hence potentially very expensive optical carrier source. Such sources could be placed in the ANs but would then have to be provisioned individually, and would be hard to synchronize due to their remote location, thus requiring more precise free-running operation, further adding to their cost. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is illustrated in a block diagram a portion of the photonic network of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In addition to the network elements shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> includes more detail for the tandem nodes or central photonic switch <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and multiple lambda sources <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> coupled to edge switching nodes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so that the optical carriers only have to transit the access plant (typically 1-3 km) and none of the interoffice trunks (typically 10-20 km), which would give too long a path. The individual multi-lambda sources may be kept synchronized by distributing a reference wavelength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The photonic path termination and generation within the access nodes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are shown in greater detail. With respect to access node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> there is included therein coarse WDM (or sparse-DWDM, &lsqb;S-DWDM&rsqb;) demux <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and mux <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, DWDM transponders <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and electronic interfaces <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Each DWDM, transponder for example <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, includes an interleaver <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> a receiver <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and a modulator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The WDM demux and mux only need to be of sufficient quality to handle coarse WDM, i.e., having a grid spacing of 200 GHz-1 THz (typically 500 GHz) rather than the 50-100 GHz spacing of DWDM. However the access node of the present embodiment can actually be considered to be operating in a &ldquo;sparse DWDM&rdquo; mode since the access node uses lambdas of DWDM precision, spaced apart like CWDM. This allows photonic carrier concatenation directly between the access plant with a low number of well separated optical carriers, permitting the use of low cost, low precision optical components, with the closely packed, high efficiency core DWDM optical carrier plan, as long as the actual optical carrier frequency is accurate enough and stable enough. For this reason these are generated centrally and distributed to the access equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In addition, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> includes a central core node <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> including a photonic node <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, similar in structure to the tandem node <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a metropolitan packet node (or core router) <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> with the central multiple lambda source <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> coupled thereto. The core router <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> has associated large DWDM transponder array, including transponders <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> that operate in a similar manner to those described with regard to the access node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A coupler, interleaver or other multiplexing device <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> connects the multi-lambda source <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to the access node <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and a coupler, interleaver or other multiplexing device <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> connects the multi-lambda source <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> to the core node <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. This could be via extra ports of downstream DWDM or even through the switch, but doing so would use up one third of the switch ports. The combining could be done on the downstream portion of the access line card of the switch. For example, in an 8 channel sparse DWDM scenario, we would provide 8 wavelength WDM upstream, and 8&plus;8 channel WDM downstream, where 8 channels are switched through the switch and are modulated with traffic to the ANs and 8 channels are unmodulated carriers from the MLS to be turned round and modulated. These can be passed through 16 channel WDM filters downstream or through broad-lobed 8 channel SDWDM parts, with both the unmodulated and modulated carriers passing through the same lobe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> One of the functions of the photonic edge node is to &ldquo;concentrate&rdquo; the used lambdas from the sparsely filled sparse-DWDM fibers into a proportionally lesser number of more highly filled core network DWDM fibers. For example a switch node may have 20 access port cards each driving 5 fibers with a potential of 8 sparse DWDM optical carriers on each, but the actual utilization level might be only an average of an arbitary 2.3 lambdas per fiber for a total of 230 out of a possible 800 optical carriers. Under such conditions it would be prudent to sub-equip trunk port cards, for example, down from a possible 20 (the same 800 lambdas) to 8 (offering 320 lambdas into which the existing 230 can be mapped and up to another 90 can be added before a further trunk port card needs to be plugged in to the switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In operation, all the optical carriers at the various required specific wavelengths needed throughout the metropolitan photonic network <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are all generated in the photonic layer at edge switching nodes, for example edge nodes <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and are allocated out via the edge nodes to the access nodes for modulation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> An unmodulated optical carrier is sent to the access node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> along with a modulated carrier. The interleaver <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> separates the modulator carrier from the unmodulated one. Typically these would be adjacent wavelengths in the multi-wavelength distribution plan. The modulated wavelength then is passed to the receiver <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> where it is detected and thereby converted from an optical signal to an electrical signal. The unmodulated optical carrier is passed to the modulator <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> where it is modulated by an electrical signal to produce a modulated wavelength for transmission of data back to the photonic switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Hence, according to an embodiment of the present invention to ensure that the upstream wavelength is both the correct wavelength and is of sufficient precision to enter the DWDM network, the edge node is provided with an optical carrier it is to modulate, from the central multi-lambda source <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. This has the benefit of being substantially cheaper and simpler to implement by eliminating both the need for a complex DWDM individual source in the access node and the need to provision wavelengths in that equipment and monitor for compliance. In effect, the access nodes become optical frequency agnostic and dumbly modulate whatever wavelength the core photonic network sees fit to give them. The centralization of the sourcing of the optical carriers allows six major other benefits in their generation. These are: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Ability to lock to a central network-wide lambda reference </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> All the optical carriers can be generated in close physical proximity, opening up the possibility of sharing some of the equipment needed to generate them or to stabilize them, lock them or to monitor them. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Each optical carrier can be used multiple times on different access fibers by splitting and amplification. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The optical carriers can be generated in a benign central office environment, even when feeding an outside plant located access multiplexer, resulting in less environmental stress on the design. If necessary, locking the carriers to a reference wavelength can be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> There need not be any individual tunable or wavelength administered sources in the access nodes, although such sources (e.g. from third party equipment) can be accommodated as long as they meet DWDM frequency/wavelength precision and stability requirements. The centralized sources can be shared over multiple edge nodes by power splitting, amplification and may result in a lower network cost through simpler lambda administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The centralized, central-office located multi-lambda source can readily be fed with a synchronization optical carrier of a specific wavelength or frequency, distributed throughout the interoffice network for this purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> While <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows a wavelength plane switch, it should be understood that any photonic switch structure that can achieve full connectivity, between all ports that can be interconnected in a DWDM mode, can be used. Furthermore, it should be understood that, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows only a few (2) DWDM feeds out of each side of each switch, there are in fact multiple DWDM feeds to multiple other nodes, to create a mesh, or sparse mesh network, homing in on one or more core nodes as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and in co-pending provisional application entitled &ldquo;Communications Network for a Metropolitan Area&rdquo; filed Jun. 1, 2001. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is illustrated the portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> showing the optical carrier paths to/from the core node router, from/to the access node. In operation, optical carriers at all required wavelengths or optical frequencies are all generated in the photonic layer either adjacent the core nodes, for example optical carrier <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> at central core node <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> or adjacent the edge photonic switches, for example optical carrier <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> at edge photonic switch <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The optical carriers (e.g. optical carrier <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>) destined to carry information from the access nodes to the core node(s) at the required wavelengths are allocated out to the photonic access nodes for modulation from the access multiple lambda source <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> coupled to access node <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the optical carriers (e.g. optical carrier <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>) destined to carry information from the core nodes out to the access nodes are generated at the correct wavelength in MLS <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and are coupled to the core node <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> for modulation. This embodiment of the present invention has the further advantage of providing wavelengths to be modulated in relatively close proximity to the modulators, while maintaining those modulators as generic, wavelength independent parts without a need for local tunable lasers on the transponders. In the present embodiment, the closest the optical source gets to the modulator is the other end of an access fiber. The optical source suffers some degradation when being transmitted over this fiber, because the signal level of the optical carrier will be attenuated, however other impairments such as chromatic dispersion are irrelevant since there are no modulation sidebands to disperse on the downstream optical carrier transmission prior to modulation. According to this embodiment of the present invention, to ensure that the upstream wavelength is both the correct wavelength and is of sufficient precision to enter the DWDM network, the access modulator is provided with an optical carrier it is to modulate, from the access multi-lambda source <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Similarly, to ensure that the downstream wavelength is both the correct wavelength and is of sufficient precision to transit the DWDM network, the core node modulator is provided with an optical carrier it is to modulate, from the central multi-lambda source <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The core node <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> provides a large service-aware node function needed to handle the partitioning of traffic on a per-service and per-carrier level at the entry to the multiple long-haul networks, and to provide packet-level and sub-lambda level circuit services within the metro area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The core node acts as a hub for the subtending Metro Photonic Nodes (MPSN&apos;s) that provide a flexible and potentially agile method of mapping capacity from the edge nodes to the core nodes. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a variation on the structure of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, for the case of close physical location of the router/data switch <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the Photonic switch <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> of the core node <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In this case the back-to-back DWDM multiplexing <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, demultiplexing <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> can be eliminated, for a potential saving in cost. Note that the lambda converter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> can also be treated the same way. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, there is illustrated the portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> showing the paths of optical carriers to/from the core node router, to/from the access node. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, but shows the paths for optical carriers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> for the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, there is illustrated the portion of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> showing the paths of optical carriers to/from the core node lambda converter, to/from the access node. The unmodulated carriers <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> from the core node multi-lambda source <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are input to the lambda converter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> for modulation. The modulated carrier <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>M from access node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is also input to lambda converter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, wherein the modulated carrier <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight>M is received to produce an information signal <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> that is used to modulate optical carrier <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> to produce modulation optical carrier <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>M that is conveyed to access node <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Similarly, the unmodulated optical carrier <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> generated at MLS <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is modulated in access node <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to produce a modulated optical carrier <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>M is received at the lambda converter <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to produce an information signal <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> that is then used to modulate the unmodulated optical carrier <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to produce a modulated optical carrier <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>M, then conveyed to access node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In this way end-to-end lambda-based communications are established between access node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, without having to provision for non-blocking of lambdas on an end-to-end basis. The network need only be provisioned for edge-to-core non-blocking lambdas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, there is illustrated in a block diagram a metro photonic switch, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, for the photonic network of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. The metropolitan photonic node <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a photonic switch core fabric of &ldquo;N&rdquo; independent, replaceable blocks, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, arrays of WDM demux <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, WDM mux <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, with both the WDM mux and WDM demux existing in several forms, according to whether they are feeding DWDM ore fibers or access S-DWDM fibers or other access structures, including single carrier per fiber solutions, a 1-N switch core protection switch <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>, a second 1-N switch core protection switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a protection plane <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>, (port card protection switches <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, which bypass traffic from a failed port card to a spare one), an impairment compensator block <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, for the switch core, a second impairment compensator <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> for the protection plane, both of which operate under control of the test and measurement system <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, an input WDM optical pre-amplifier <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and an output WDM optical power amplifier <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>, a test and measurement system <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> which performs the checks and analyses required to determine the settings for the compensation blocks and to generally monitor and alarm the outgoing optical carriers, for instance for loss of an optical carrier or for a mis-connection within the switch, and electro-optics <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, which both provide any optical carrier add-drop into the electro-optic domain and access a lambda converter, currently implemented in electro-optic technology. The switch is controlled by the control plane <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and management plane <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> based upon data models <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, which contains the connection maps, link conditions, etc. for the surrounding environment. The management plane <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and the control plane <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the data models <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are supported by network communication <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and provide contract manager <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> and element manager <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> For simplicity, the photonic network node <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, is shown having a DWDM demultiplexer on the input side and a S-DWDM multiplexer on the output side. Actual implementation of this switch could include a mix of inputs and outputs of both DWDM and S-DWDM which would be physically provisioned as different tributary line cards. To permit lambda concentration more capacity may be offered into/from the switch node on the access side than on the trunk side. For example in a case where 8 channel S-DWDM is used in the access and 40 channel DWDM is used in the core, then with no concentration every five access fibers would require a core fiber, but, if, as an example, on average only 2 of 8 wavelengths in the access are in service/lit, then the number of core fibers can be reduced from one per five access fibers to one in 20 (in practice one in fifteen), to allow better use of the core DWDM network. Then, as more access wavelengths get lit, extra capacity can be added in the form of more core fibers, core trib cards. As drawn the input side of the node would be connected to the core network carrying DWDM traffic hence the gain <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is applied to traffic coming into the node from the core network. DWDM demultiplexer <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> then demultiplexes this traffic into individual wavelengths and protection switch <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> provides 1-N protection in the event of failure on the switching core for one wavelength. The switching core <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> switches the wavelengths to the desired output ports that then pass through the impairment monitor block <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to ensure operation of the switch and proper optical characteristics of that particular wavelength output port. The output ports are also protected by the 1-N protection switch <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> prior to being multiplexed using wavelengths division multiplexer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> for passing to the access side of the network. The electro-optics block <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is provided for in the optical-electrical conversion of wavelengths for the purposes of service adaptation, regeneration, wavelength conversion, electrical cross connection or monitoring. The control plane <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> controls switch end connections, switch configuration, protection and restoration, test access and impairment compensation. The management plane provides network management system, configuration, performance, faults, events handling and testing. The data models <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> include network and node topology, optical link status, maps of used, unused lambdas on each port, status of adjacent nodes, connection algorithms as a function of traffic or service class, network management, and connection control. The test measurement system <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> monitors the spectral power path integrity and may include chromatic dispersion monitoring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> While the core fabric is shown having N lambda-plane switches when initially installed in a network this switch can be sub-equipped with lambda switch planes, for example, if we have a 40 lambda, 16&times;16 fiber node, switching 640 lambdas total, we can sub-equip switch ports linearly, fibers and switch planes with utilized lambdas. Hence, in an early deployment, where the node need only support 15 lambdas on each of 5 fibers, then only 15 of 40 switch planes and only 5 of 16 port cards need be deployed, giving a lower start-up cost and allowing cost to be added as switch capacity grows, deferring investment. </paragraph>

As indicated by the curve <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> the noise figure is relatively constant across the wavelengths while the gain as illustrated by line <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> varies with wavelengths. Consequently, using EDWA across the entire spectrum would not result in equal amplification without a complex complementary filter whereas using arrays of EDWA for individual channels in the wavelength plan of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, or a small group thereof, allows each amplifier in the array to be set to the appropriate gain, which provides a much more uniform amplification of the wavelengths used, as well as a method for removing level inequalities due to other sources, by actively controlling the gain of each EDWA, based upon a feedback loop, derived from the output power spectrum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> The current EDWA technology has enough bandwidth to cover 1529-1562 nm with a minimum best gain of 5.5 dB although the industry is improving the gain, flatness, power handling and bandwidth of these parts. Because its current gain flatness is very poor across the band, it has to be limited to small groups or individual wavelengths/carriers, which makes it suitable for amplifying individual carriers, for example to gain-flatten the node, but makes it inappropriate for use as the output power amplifier of the DWDM combined signal, which remains an application for conventional optical amplifiers. Its noise figure is relatively independent of wavelength across the band at &tilde;5 dB. Future EDWA&apos;s may be expected to have a higher maximum gain and flatter broader bandwidth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>, there is illustrated, in more detail, a portion of the network of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> showing wavelength distribution at the access portion thereof. The network portion includes edge node <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, access node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and multiple lambda source <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, each shown in further detail to illustrate one simple method of lambda distribution in the access portion of the network, recognizing that more sophisticated schemes are also possible.

There is a fundamental relationship between the number of optical carriers (W) and their grid spacing (X GHz) on the DWDM trunking side of the switch and the number of carrier grid slots (Y) per access fiber, their grid spacing (Z GHz) and fiber fan-out (number of access fibers that can be fully supported from each core fiber&mdash;S) and the provisioning ratio/&ldquo;concentration ratio&rdquo; between the access and core fiber plant (T % of access slots supported in the core network) for a given number of core, access fibers, U, V respectively. These relationships are: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> i) The number of wavelength slots supported on an access fiber is Y&equals;W/S </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Different solutions to these equations give different access capacities, access grid spacings and average &ldquo;concentration&rdquo; due to filling core trunking DWDM pipes from under-filled access fibers. Both Z&equals;400 GHz and Z&equals;500 GHz examples are used in this document, as illustrations of the flexibility possible, the Z&equals;400 GHz example being associated with the mapping from 40 ch DWDM to 10 channel SDWDM, and Z&equals;500 GHz being associated with mapping from 40 ch DWDM to 8 channel S-DWDM. The following example will use a 500 GHz spacing. Practical spacings range from 400 GHz to 2 THz, corresponding to 10 channels down to 2 channels, with practical solutions at 10, 8, 5 4, 2 channels, with spacings of 400, 500, 800, 1000, 2000 GHz. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> In operation, the Multi-Lambda Source <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> generates <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> optical carriers on the standard ITU 100 GHz grid by means described in co-pending application (MLS synch) or equivalent alternative means. The wavelengths from the MLS <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are grouped or multiplexed by multiplexers <highlight><bold>117</bold></highlight> into 5 groups of 8 wavelengths that are of the same wavelength composition as the downstream sparse-DWDM frequency plan on the access side of the edge node <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. These groups are fed through amplifying splitters <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, (such as an amplifying 8-way splitter such as that manufactured by TEEM Photonics, of Grenoble, France) or combinations of discrete amplifiers and splitters. The individual optical feeds are fed into the appropriate outgoing ports via a coupler or interleaver device <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight>. It is important to note that, for the access fiber port with &ldquo;wavelength plan 1&rdquo; downstream wavelengths, the unmodulated wavelengths from MRS <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are not from wavelength plan 1, since this would overwrite the downstream data, but are from one of the other wavelength plans 2-5. In the present example wavelength plan 2 is used for the unmodulated carrier wavelengths. This results in eight groups of two wavelengths (one being a downstream signal, the other an unmodulated carrier) being generated with an inter-group spacing of 500 GHz (allowing relatively coarse demultiplexers <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> in the outside plant), with an intercarrier spacing between the two carriers in the group being a constant 100 GHz. The entire optical structure consisting of eight 500 GHz spaced downstream data streams and eight downstream unmodulated carriers is propagated over the outside plant fiber plant, for example optical fiber <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, to the far end optical sparse-DWDM demultiplexer <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, a 500 GHz channelized optical demux, that drops lambdas 9 and 10 into the optical port card <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> of access node <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The 100 GHz grid optical interleaver <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight> (a recursive optical device such as a resonant cavity) separates the odd numbered and even numbered wavelengths into two separate streams, in this case separating the two wavelengths lambda 9 and lambda 10. Lambda 9 carries the downstream data and is fed to the downstream optical data receiver <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>, received, converted into an electronic signal and passed via the output <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> into the access node electronic circuitry (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) or other photonic network terminating device into which this functionality can be built. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> Meanwhile lambda 10, being the optical carrier for the upstream path is passed to the modulation area of the upstream transmitter. The optical carrier lambda 10 passes through the carrier power stabilization and/or amplification loop <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> to ensure that a constant known power level is passed into the modulator <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>. This loop may be implemented as a compact EDWA integrated into the same substrate as the modulator, especially if that modulator is a Mach Zehnder modulator fabricated on a Silicon or silica substrate and based upon an electro-optic polymer approach, since this could be fabricated in series with the Silica waveguide required for the EDWA. However, the modulator <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> can take many forms, such as an electro-absorbsion modulator, but the modulator shown here is an electro-optic Mach-Zehnder modulator, that can be implemented in Lithium Niobate, Indium Phosphide, or as an electro-optic polymer modulator. The modulator also operates within a series of feedback loops, forming the modulator depth, power stabilization loop <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>, the nature of which is determined by the properties of the chosen modulator technology. Typically, with a MZ modulator <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight>, there is a peak power control and an extinction ratio control, controlling the brilliance of &ldquo;1&rdquo;s and the closeness to darkness of &ldquo;0&rdquo;s, respectively. The output from this passive modulator is then fed through an inverse of the incoming optical demultiplex, in the appropriate wavelength port and is fed via optical fiber <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>upstream to the edge node <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Here the upstream modulated lambda <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is passed through an access-side port card (not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>) to the switch core and is coupled straight into the outgoing DWDM multiplexer <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>m </italic></highlight>of the switch. The optical carrier must be of a frequency that directly aligns to the outgoing DWDM grid on the trunk side of the switch. This is accomplished by ensuring that the optical carrier originates in a Multi-lambda source that is of an appropriate precision. The precise optical carrier is then fed out to the access point, is modulated and returned to the network, having not undergone any modifications that can shift it&apos;s optical carrier frequency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, there is illustrated an example metropolitan photonic network switch configured for implementing the wavelength plan of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. This wavelength plan includes 40 wavelengths with 100 GHz spacing in the core network and on the access side five groups of wavelengths, each group having eight wavelengths spaced 500 GHz apart. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> In operation, a wavelength input to access card <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> via fiber group <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> including five fibers each carrying up to eight wavelengths. The wavelengths are demultiplexed into individual wavelengths and cross connected direction shuffled into wavelength order for input to the protection switches prior to input to the appropriate lambda plane switch. On the output of the lambda plane switch the ports are similarly protected by protection switches <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>B before being coupled to the output DWDM multiplexer which outputs the single fiber having 40 100 GHz spaced DWDM channels. Note that, by changing the ratio of N to M (or U to V in the earlier equations) a variable level of concentration can be introduced, permitting very few trunk DWDM fibers to support a very large number of access fibers, especially in the early deployment phases, when the access fiber has been deployed but relatively few customers have yet signed up, and hence most of the access capacity is &ldquo;dark&rdquo; latent capacity, but we still want to efficiently fill the DWDM core plant. As more subscribers sign on the traffic handling of the node can be reinforced simply by adding more trunk port cards to the switch node. The level of trunk port traffic handling should of course be maintained at a level about 30% above that of the access plant actually in use, to permit some excess bandwidth capacity for the agile lambda control system to provision into, but this is a small over-capacity in comparison to the capacity savings possible due to the sub-provisioning of trunk port cards. In order to implement a practical &ldquo;lambda-on-demand&rdquo; network, whereby end users can request the initial illumination of an erstwhile dark wavelength, a method of signaling from the end customer premises to the switch node and on to the O-UNI is required. This is done at 1310 nm, signaling into the Ethernet communications hub located at each switch, since all 1310 nm communications signals are hubbed to this point, treating it as a 100 bT LAN hub with outlying optical terminations as &ldquo;terminals&rdquo; on the 100 bT network. This is shown and described in more detail under <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, there is illustrated in a block diagram the metro photonic switch of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> showing further detail. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>, there is illustrated a photonic metro node including all components for a practical implementation, with the exception of the electro-optic add-drop and wavelength converters, which in any case are not required in the majority of nodes in the network of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and which were shown earlier, on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In addition to those components shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> includes a detail of the Ethernet control linkages for the metropolitan network implementation. This figure also shows the application of the multi-wavelength source outputs to the network node. Specifically, the impairment control block <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is expanded to show a wavelength division multiplex spectrum analysis block <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, a path integrity block <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and an impairment sensing block <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. A chromatic dispersion discrimination block, in conjunction with a chromatic dispersion compensation system could also be added. Each receives input from scanning front ends <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> tapping signals for input and output fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In operation, the WDM spectrum analysis block, in conjunction with the scanning front end <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>, periodically measures the output power levels in each optical carrier of each output WDM feed. Any measured departure from the correct power level for any given carrier is detected and corrected by sending a correction to the appropriate EDWA associated with that optical carrier, so as to restore that optical carrier to the correct level. This can be a relatively slow process (scanning every few seconds) since the mechanisms that are likely to cause level drift are slow in nature. However there is a time when this scanning slow adjustment process has to be interrupted, and that is when a switching action takes place in the switch. Because the input powers of signals into the switch have either unknown levels or a tolerance on their levels, and because the line optical amplifiers change their gain in a transient manner in the number of optical carriers suddenly changes, special considerations are required when taking down or setting up a new switch path. When an old path is to be taken down and a new path is to be established, then the EDWA associated with the old path is commanded to reduce its gain down to minimum, in a ramped manner, such that the external amplifier control loop can adjust for the loss of that carrier or carriers, and not disturb the remaining in service carriers. The EDWA associated with the new switch path also has it&apos;s gain set to minimum. Then the scanning spectrum analyzer in stopped from scanning and is &ldquo;camped&rdquo; on the new path output, the switch is made and then the EDWA gain is slowly ramped up, so as not to &ldquo;shock&rdquo; the output amplifier, the gain being ramped up until the &ldquo;camped&rdquo; spectrum analyzer sees the correct output level. At this point the EDWA gain is fixed and the normal scanning cycle resumes. The impairment sensing block can also be fed with the output of the scanning front end and hence can be connected in parallel with the WDM spectrum analysis block to any output fiber and lambda,. The impairment-sensing block may consist of a chromatic dispersion discriminator such as is filed under copending application Ser. No. 09/842,236 filed Apr. 26, 2001 or may take other forms. The output of this block may be used to take automatic corrective action (e.g. the dispersion discriminator may control a dispersion compensator) or may provide parametric data for the analysis by, and action by the OAM system. </paragraph>

The control processors are also in communication with the Ethernet communication <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> including Ethernet communications hub <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> and a pair of 1310 nm transmitter/receiver arrays <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. The transmitter/receiver arrays associated with access fibers, are connected to multiple customer premises Ethernet transceivers via optical splitters that bypass the outside plant or CPE located Sparse-DWDM multiplexers and provide a means to allow a network access end point currently associated with a &ldquo;dark&rdquo; wavelength to request illumination of that wavelength and the establishment of an end-to-end path. This process is similar to dialing in a conventional telephone network, where the act of picking up the phone and dialing both establishes a requirement for an end-to-end connection and the allocation of a DS-0 time slot within the switch. </paragraph>

The control plane of the switch is connected to an Ethernet communications hub <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>. The Ethernet hub <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is &ldquo;Ethernet switch&rdquo; built in to the metro photonic node for the purposes of communicating control messages and lambda set-up signaling with other nodes, with the Optical-UNI server and the photonic path endnodes. The Ethernet Hub <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is connected to at least one fiber per route to each of its nearest neighbour switches and each access Ethernet Multiplexer, with 100 base-T 1300 nm optics that are coarse WDM (band-WDM) coupled on to incoming and outgoing fibers on the switch. The fiber links will have a much higher attenuation at 1300 nm (typically 0.5-0.7 dB/km versus 0.15-0.25 dB/km at 1550 nm) but this is not a problem since the much lower bit rate of 100 baseT transmission will accommodate a much higher link loss and links are not photonically tandemed since the control/signaling must be intercepted at each node to extract/insert the relevant Ethernet traffic to/from that node. Another addition is the co-location of a multi-lambda source with the switch in the central office. Whilst the &ldquo;round-robin&rsquo; dealing-out of wavelengths cross the access fibers has opened up the wavelength spacing in the access domain, reducing the demands on the precision of the outside plant/access equipment filters, the actual wavelengths used are directly photonically connected between the DWDM core and the semi-DWDM access. This means that the actual wavelengths have to be controlled to a precision compatible with the DWDM filters on the trunk side of the switch if they are to propagate successfully over that DWM core network. The downstream wavelengths into the access have been generated to the required precision. However, in the upstream direction, the need to concatenate the flow of the upstream wavelength through the 500 GHz spaced semi-DWDM access plant with its flow into the 100 GHz spaced core plant could be a problem. The metropolitan photonic node overcomes the problem by placing a multi-lambda wavelength generator in the central office as a centralized resource and by distributing out to the end access multiplexer/photonic end-point the lambda that it is to use. Furthermore such an approach actually simplifies wavelength administration because it removes the need to provision a tunable source in the remote access equipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows a bidirectional switch node with a common switching fabric for the two directions. While this is the most generic structure, in the early period of photonic technology, when it is difficult to fabricate large switch modules, this can be limiting, since it reduces the capacity of the node 2:1 relative to what could be achieved if all of the switch module capacity could be devoted to a single direction of transmission, without changing the size of the module. We can exploit the architecture of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in that there is (in a pure edge photonic switch only) no access-to-access hair-pinning connectivity requirement and no trunk-to-trunk capability requirements, so the two directions can be separated at the fabric level (but not at the control level). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows a uni-directional trunk-to-access switch, while <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows it&apos;s inverse. In fact both of these have to be combined under a common control structure to create a practical bi-directional access &larr;&rarr; trunk switch, which uses twice the number of the same size switch modules to produce a switch with twice the throughput (whereas the similar scaling of the switch of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> would use the same number of switch modules, each of twice the size, which are more difficult to fabricate). <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows the two switches, one from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> and one from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, combined to create a single larger bi-directional edge switch. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows how to modify this &ldquo;pure&rdquo; edge switch with only access &larr;&rarr; trunk connectivity into a switch that is predominantly an edge switch, but with an engineerable level of trunk &larr;&rarr; trunk connectivity. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference> shows how the inter-plane connectivity implied in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> can be implemented using a subset of the capabilities of a 6-port MEMS device, such as was filed under copending application Ser. No. 09/593,697 filed Jun. 15, 2000 and assigned to the same assignee as the present application. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15, 16</cross-reference> show the construction of a node of twice the throughput, in edge-only (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>) and edge-tandem mode (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, there is graphically illustrated a second wavelength plan for the network of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The second wavelength plan includes a simplified DWDM plan having 16 wavelengths and a simplified sparse DWDM plan having four wavelength groups of four wavelengths each. The DWDM wavelength plan <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes 16 wavelengths with representative response curves for the DWDM filter having peeks <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>p</italic></highlight>.

Similarly, wavelengths group <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> shows curves <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>, wavelengths group <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> shows response curves <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> wavelength group <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> shows response curves <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> and wavelengths group <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> shows curves <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>344</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>346</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>348</bold></highlight>. The DWDM plan includes wavelengths having a spacing of 100 GHz while the sparse WDM access plan has a 400 GHz spacing between wavelengths. The characteristics of the wavelengths used are the same in both the DWDM plan and the sparse DWDM plan so that the wavelengths can pass from the access side of the network to the core side of the network without having to be regenerated. Similarly wavelengths passing from the DWDM core can move into the access portion without modification. </paragraph>
