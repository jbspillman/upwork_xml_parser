<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This disclosure relates to a sensor arrangement for an Integrated Pressure Management Apparatus (IPMA) that manages pressure and detects leaks in a fuel system. This disclosure also relates to a sensor arrangement for an integrated pressure management system that performs a leak diagnostic for the headspace in a fuel tank, a canister that collects volatile fuel vapors from the headspace, a purge valve, and all associated hoses. And this disclosure also relates to controlled duty cycle purging that provides active leak detection recognition by the IPMA while the engine is operating and able to accept evaporative purging. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In a conventional pressure management system for a vehicle, fuel vapor that escapes from a fuel tank is stored in a canister. If there is a leak in the fuel tank, canister or any other component of the vapor handling system, some fuel vapor could exit through the leak to escape into the atmosphere instead of being stored in the canister. Thus, it is desirable to detect leaks as a result of a 0.5 millimeter or greater break in the vapor handling system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In such conventional pressure management systems, excess fuel vapor accumulates immediately after engine shutdown, thereby creating a positive pressure in the fuel vapor management system. Thus, it is desirable to vent, or &ldquo;blow-off,&rdquo; through the canister, this excess fuel vapor and to facilitate vacuum generation in the fuel vapor management system. Similarly, it is desirable to relieve positive pressure during tank refueling by allowing air to exit the tank at high flow rates. This is commonly referred to as onboard refueling vapor recovery (ORVR). </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a sensor arrangement for an integrated pressure management apparatus. The sensor arrangement comprises a chamber having an interior volume varying in response to fluid pressure in the chamber, a first switch, and a second switch. The chamber includes a diaphragm that is displaceable between a first configuration in response to fluid pressure above a first pressure level, a second configuration in response to fluid pressure below the first pressure level, and a third configuration in response to fluid pressure below a second pressure level. The third pressure level being lower than the second pressure level, and the second pressure level being lower than the first pressure level. The first switch is actuated by the diaphragm in the second configuration. And the second switch is actuated by the diaphragm in the third configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides an integrated pressure management apparatus. The integrated pressure management apparatus comprises a housing defining an interior chamber, a pressure operable device, a first switch, and a second switch. The housing includes the first and second ports that communicate with the interior chamber. The pressure operable device separates the chamber into a first portion that communicates with the first port, a second portion that communicates with the second port, and a third portion that has an interior volume that varies in response to fluid pressure in the first portion. The pressure operable device is displaceable between a first configuration in response to fluid pressure in the third portion above a first pressure level, a second configuration in response to fluid pressure in the third portion below the first pressure level, and a third configuration in response to fluid pressure in the third portion below a second pressure level. The third pressure level is lower than the second pressure level, and the second pressure level is lower than the first pressure level. The first switch is actuated by the pressure operable device in the second configuration. And the second switch is actuated by the pressure operable device in the third configuration </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a method of detecting detecting leaks in a fuel system for an internal combustion engine that has an engine control unit. The fuel system includes a purge valve and an integrated pressure management apparatus. The integrated pressure appratus has a first switch that is activated at a first pressure level below ambient pressure, a second switch that is activated at a second pressure level below ambient, and a pressure operable device relieving excess vacuum at a third pressure level below ambient. The third pressure level is lower than the second pressure level, and the second pressure level is lower than the first pressure level. The method comprises operating the purge valve according to a first controlled duty cycle purge during operation of the internal combustion engine, indicating a gross leak, operating the purge valve according to a second controlled duty cycle purge during operation of the internal combustion engine, indicating a sealed fuel system, indicating a small leak, and indicating a large leak. The operating the purge valve according to the first controlled duty cycle purge draws a first vacuum between the first and second pressure levels. The operating the purge valve according to the second controlled duty cycle purge draws a second vacuum between the first and second pressure levels. The second vacuum is greater than the first vacuum. A gross leak is indicated if the first switch is not activated. A sealed fuel system is indicated if the first and second switches are activated. A small leak is indicated if the second switch is not activated and the first switch remains activated. And a large leak is indicated if the second switch is not activated and the first switch is intially activated and is subsequently deactivated.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> fuel system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, e.g., for an engine (not shown), includes a fuel tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a vacuum source <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such as an intake manifold of the engine, a purge valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a charcoal canister <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and an integrated pressure management system (IPMA) <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The IPMA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> performs a plurality of functions including signaling <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that a first predetermined pressure (vacuum) level exists, relieving negative pressure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at a value below a third predetermined pressure level, relieving positive pressure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> above a second pressure level, and controllably connecting <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> the charcoal canister <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the ambient atmospheric pressure A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the course of cooling that is experienced by the fuel system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, e.g., after the engine is turned off, a vacuum is created in the tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and charcoal canister <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by virtue of the IPMA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> isolating the fuel system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The existence of a vacuum at the first predetermined pressure level indicates that the integrity of the fuel system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is satisfactory. Thus, signaling <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is used for indicating the integrity of the fuel system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, i.e., that there are no leaks. Subsequently relieving pressure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at a pressure level below the second predetermined pressure level protects the integrity of the fuel tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, i.e., prevents it from collapsing due to vacuum in the fuel system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Relieving pressure <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> also prevents &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; air from being drawn through a fuel cap (not shown) into the tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Immediately after the engine is turned off, relieving pressure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> allows excess pressure due to fuel vaporization to blow off, thereby facilitating the desired vacuum generation that occurs during cooling. During blow off, air within the fuel system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is released while fuel molecules are retained. Similarly, in the course of refueling the fuel tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, relieving pressure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> allows air to exit the fuel tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at high flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> While the engine is turned on, controllably connecting <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> the canister <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to the ambient air A allows confirmation of the purge flow and allows confirmation of the signaling <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> performance. While the engine is turned off, controllably connecting <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> allows a computer for the engine to monitor the vacuum generated during cooling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, shows a first embodiment of the IPMA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that can be directly mounted on the charcoal canister <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The IPMA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes a housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that can be mounted to the body of the charcoal canister <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by a &ldquo;bayonet&rdquo; style attachment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. This attachment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, in combination with a snap finger <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, allows the IPMA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to be readily serviced in the field. Of course, different styles of attachments between the IPMA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and the body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can be substituted for the illustrated bayonet attachment <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, e.g., a threaded attachment, an interlocking telescopic attachment, etc. Alternatively, the body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be integrally formed from a common homogenous material, can be permanently bonded together (e.g., using an adhesive), or the body <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be interconnected via an intermediate member such as a pipe or a flexible hose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be an assembly of a main housing piece <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and housing piece covers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Although two housing piece covers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>have been illustrated, it is desirable to minimize the number of housing pieces to reduce the number of potential leak points, i.e., between housing pieces, which must be sealed. Minimizing the number of housing piece covers depends largely on the fluid flow path configuration through the main housing piece <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and the manufacturing efficiency of incorporating the necessary components of the IPMA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via the ports of the flow path. Additional features of the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and the incorporation of components therein will be further described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Signaling <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> occurs when vacuum at the first and second predetermined pressure levels is present in the charcoal canister <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. A pressure operable device <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> separates an interior chamber in the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The pressure operable device <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which includes a diaphragm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> that is operatively interconnected to a valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, separates the interior chamber of the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into an upper portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and a lower portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The diaphragm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> includes a bead <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>that provides a seal between the housing pieces <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>,<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. The upper portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with the ambient atmospheric pressure through a first port <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. The lower portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with a second port <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> between housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> the charcoal canister <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The lower portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is also in fluid communicating with a separate portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>via a signal passageway that extends through spaces between a solenoid <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> (as will be further described hereinafter) and the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, through spaces between an intermediate lead frame <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> (as will be further described hereinafter) and the housing <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and through a penetration in a protrusion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Orienting the opening of the signal passageway toward the charcoal canister <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> yields unexpected advantages in providing fluid communication between the portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The force created as a result of vacuum in the separate portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>causes the diaphragm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to be displaced toward the housing part <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. This displacement is opposed by a resilient element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, e.g., a leaf spring. A calibrating screw <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> can adjust the bias of the resilient element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> such that a desired level of vacuum, e.g., one inch of water, will depress a first switch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that can be mounted on a printed circuit board <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In turn, the printed circuit board is electrically connected via an intermediate lead frame <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to an outlet terminal <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> supported by the housing part <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The intermediate lead frame <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> penetrates the protrusion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. An O-ring <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> seals the housing part <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>with respect to the housing part <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. As vacuum is released, i.e., the pressure in the portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>rises, the resilient element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> pushes the diaphragm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> away from the first switch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, whereby the first switch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> resets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> If, rather than releasing the vacuum, a further vacuum is drawn, as will be further described hereinafter, a second switch <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is activated, e.g., by contact with either the diaphragm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> or the resilient element <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. Thus, activation of the second switch is indicative that the fuel system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has achieved an increased vacuum level, i.e., exceeding the calibration level for activating the first switch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The second switch <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> facilitates active on-board leak detection during engine operation, as will be described hereinafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Negative pressure relieving <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> occurs as vacuum in the portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>increases, i.e., the pressure decreases below the calibration level for actuating the switch <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>. Vacuum in the charcoal canister <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the lower portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> will continually act on the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> inasmuch as the upper portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is always at or near the ambient atmospheric pressure A. At some value of vacuum, e.g., six inches of water, in excess of the levels for activating the switches <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, this vacuum will overcome the opposing force of a second resilient element <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and displace the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> away from a lip seal <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. This displacement will open the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from its closed configuration, thus allowing ambient air to be drawn through the upper portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> into the lower the portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. That is to say, in an open configuration of the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the first and second ports <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are in fluid communication. In this way, vacuum in the fuel system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be regulated so as to prevent a collapse in the fuel system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Controllably connecting <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to similarly displace the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from its closed configuration to its open configuration can be provided by a solenoid <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. At rest, the second resilient element <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> displaces the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to its closed configuration. A ferrous armature <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, which can be fixed to the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, can have a tapered tip that creates higher flux densities and therefore higher pull-in forces. A coil <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> surrounds a solid ferrous core <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> that is isolated from the charcoal canister <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by an O-ring <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. A ferrous strap <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> that serves to focus the flux back towards the armature <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> completes the flux path. When the coil <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is energized, the resultant flux pulls the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> toward the core <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The armature <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> can be prevented from touching the core <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> by a tube <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> that sits inside the second resilient element <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing magnetic lock-up. Since very little electrical power is required for the solenoid <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> to maintain the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in its open configuration, the power can be reduced to as little as 10% of the original power by pulse-width modulation. When electrical power is removed from the coil <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, the second resilient element <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> pushes the armature <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the normally closed configuration of the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Relieving positive pressure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is provided when there is a positive pressure in the lower portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, e.g., when the tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is being refueled. Specifically, the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is displaced to its open configuration to provide a very low restriction path for escaping air from the tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. When the charcoal canister <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and hence the lower portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, experience positive pressure above ambient atmospheric pressure, the signal passageway communicates this positive pressure to the separate portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. In turn, this positive pressure displaces the diaphragm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> downward toward the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. A diaphragm pin <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> transfers the displacement of the diaphragm <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, thereby displacing the valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to its open configuration with respect to the lip seal <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. Thus, pressure in the charcoal canister <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> due to refueling is allowed to escape through the lower portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, past the lip seal <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, through the upper portion <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and through the second port <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Relieving pressure <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is also useful for regulating the pressure in fuel tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> during any situation in which the engine is turned off. By limiting the amount of positive pressure in the fuel tank <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the cool-down vacuum effect will take place sooner and fuel tank explosion can be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> By virtue of the second switch <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> and the controlled duty cycle purging, the IPMA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is also able to perform additional functions including leak detection recognition while the engine is operating and able to accept evaporative purging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring additionally to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the evaporative space in the fuel system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is initially charged, i.e., a vacuum is drawn according to a first controlled duty cycle purge by the purge valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, until the first switch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is activated, and then the fuel system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is allowed to stabilize. Upon successful stabilization, a second controlled duty cycle purge by the purge valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is initiated to draw a further vacuum in the evaporative space. As discussed above, the IPMA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provides excess vacuum relief that prevents a implosion of the evaporative space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The second switch <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> being activated indicates a sealed system. A &ldquo;small&rdquo; threshold leak is indicated if, after a set time period of the controlled duty cycle purge by the purge valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the first switch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> remains activated but the second switch <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> is not activated. A &ldquo;large&rdquo; leak is indicated if activation of the first switch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> cannot be maintained. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> However, certain operating conditions could cause false indications. For example, operating conditions of an IPMA equipped vehicle that result in decreasing engine load and increasing engine speed, e.g., when the vehicle is being driven down an incline, can cause a false indication that the fuel system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is sealed. Conversly, operating conditions that result in increasing engine load and decreasing engine speed, e.g., when the vehicle is being driven up an incline, can cause a false indication that there is a leak in the fuel system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. These types of false indications can be identified by an Engine Control Unit (ECU) based on the engine load/speed maps that are stored in the ECU. A false indication that there is a leak can also result from excessive fuel vapors that are generated by a hot fuel cell. This type of false indication can be identified by the ECU based on a &ldquo;lambda&rdquo; sensor detecting an O<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>shift as a result of controlled duy cycle purging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Thus, active leak detection can be performed while the engine is operating using an IPMA <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprising a second pressure switch <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and using duty cycle controlled purging by the purge valve <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been disclosed with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous modifications, alterations, and changes to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the sphere and scope of the present invention, as defined in the appended claims.
