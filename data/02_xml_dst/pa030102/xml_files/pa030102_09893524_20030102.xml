<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This disclosure generally relates to an apparatus and method for preventing a migration of soldering materials from an electric terminal into the body of an electric device. In particular, this disclosure is directed to a mounting arrangement and method for mechanically supporting and electrically connecting a tactile switch. The mounting arrangement and method according to this disclosure prevent the migration, via electric contacts projecting from the body of the switch, of solder or flux into the body of the switch. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> An evaporative emission control system for a vehicle can include an integrated pressure management apparatus (IPMA). An IPMA is disclosed, for example, in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/542,052, filed Mar. 31, 2000, and which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. This IPMA can perform several functions including system leak detection. Briefly, a switch can be activated indicating displacement of a pressure operable device in response to a negative pressure level in a charcoal canister. A properly performing, i.e., sealed, evaporative system should at least maintain the negative pressure level. However, if the evaporative system has a large enough leak, the evaporative system will not maintain switch activation. This switch can be a tactile switch that must be mechanically and electrically connected with respect to the IPMA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> It is believed that soldering is one technique for providing a mechanical and electrical connection. Conventionally, a switch includes a plurality of electrical contacts that project from a body. Using known soldering materials, e.g., flux and solder, and methods, the electrical contacts are soldered to electric terminals. However, it is believed that these soldering materials, especially flux, migrate along the electrical contacts to inside the switch through small gaps between the electrical contacts and the body. The presence of these soldering materials inside the switch is believed to adversely affect operation of the switch. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Therefore, it is believed that there is a need to prevent, or at least reduce, the migration of soldering materials. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring to additionally to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> provides a foundation for supporting the terminals <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and an electrical device S. For laterally locating the electric device S, i.e., against parallel movement with respect to an imaginary plane containing the first axis <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the third axis <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can include a plurality of fingers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> that project from the housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and contiguously engage the at least one lateral face F<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>,F<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>,F<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>,F<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> of the electric device S. The fingers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> can be integrally molded with the housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in a single, homogenous unit. The housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a plastic material that is temperature resistant, electrically insulative plastic, and that can be molded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The platform <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can also be integrally molded with the housing <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in the same single, homogenous unit. In practice, the platform <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is contiguously sandwiched between the third portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> of each of the terminals <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and a base B of the electric device S. The platform <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has a platform height <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> that is measured parallel to the second axis <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the third portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to the base B. Preferably, the platform height <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> is substantially equal to the distance the electric contacts C project below the base B, or are substantially equal to a difference between the first height <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the third height <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> (or equal to the similar difference between the second height <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the third height <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>), The mounting arangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> reduces or prevents migration of the soldering materials, e.g., solder and especially flux, from the electric terminals <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> into the body of the electric device S. The migration that is prevented by the mounting arrangement <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> would otherwise occur via the electric contacts C that project through and from the electric device S. An example of a method using the mounting arrangement can include contiguously supporting the electric device S on the platform <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> such that the electric contacts C project toward the third portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and electrically connecting with soldering materials the electric contacts C to the third portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> By virtue of the space between the third portion <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and the base B of the electric device S, as provided by the platform <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and the projection of the electric contacts C below the base B, migration of soldering materials along the electric contacts C can be reduced or prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been disclosed with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous modifications, alterations, and changes to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the sphere and scope of the present invention, as defined in the appended claims.
