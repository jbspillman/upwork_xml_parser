<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This disclosure generally relates to an apparatus and method for diagnosing a fuel system of an internal combustion engine. In particular, this disclosure is directed to a diagnostic apparatus and method for servicing a fuel system including an integrated pressure management apparatus (IPMA). </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A conventional evaporative control system collects in a charcoal canister the fuel vapor that escapes from a fuel tank. If there is a leak in the fuel tank, canister, or any other component of the evaporative control system, some fuel vapor could escape through the leak into the atmosphere instead of being collected in the canister. Thus, it is desirable to detect leaks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Leak detection for an evaporative control system is one of several functions that are performed by the IPMA that is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/542,052, filed Mar. 31, 2000, and which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Briefly, a switch can be activated indicating displacement of a pressure operable device in response to a negative pressure level in a charcoal canister. A properly performing, i.e., sealed, evaporative system should at least maintain the negative pressure level. However, if the evaporative system has a large enough leak, the evaporative system will not maintain switch activation. In an extreme case of a gross leak, no appreciable negative pressure occurs in the evaporative system occurs and the switch activation does not occur. Servicing this IPMA can include verifying switch activity and evaporation system integrity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is believed that there is a need to provide an IPMA service tool that can evaluate evaporative control system integrity and verify IPMA switch activity. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As it is used herein, &ldquo;pressure&rdquo; is measured relative to the ambient atmospheric pressure. Thus, positive pressure refers to pressure greater than the ambient atmospheric pressure and negative pressure, or &ldquo;vacuum,&rdquo; refers to pressure less than the ambient atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for an internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a fuel tank <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, a charcoal canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a purge valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and an IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The fuel tank <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> contains volatile liquid fuel and fuel vapors in a headspace <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> above the surface of the liquid fuel. A filler <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> that is normally occluded by a cap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> provides access to the fuel tank <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> during refueling. A first conduit <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> provides fluid communication between the headspace <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and the charcoal canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a conventional manner, the charcoal canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> collects fuel vapors from the beadspace <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. A second conduit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> provides fluid communication from the charcoal canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the purge valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a third conduit <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> provides fluid communication from the purge valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to an intake manifold (not shown) of the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with the charcoal canister via a fourth conduit <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can perform a plurality of functions including signaling that a predetermined first pressure (vacuum) level exists in the charcoal canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, relieving pressure at a value below the first pressure level, relieving pressure above a second pressure level, and controllably connecting, via a fifth conduit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> in fluid communication with a filter <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the charcoal canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to ambient atmospheric pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The engine control unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> can provide output signals to the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and to the purge valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. These output signals are at least in part based on input signals from the IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and other sensors (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> In the course of cooling that is experienced by the fuel, e.g., after the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is turned off, a vacuum is allowed to develop in the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> due to its isolation from the atmosphere by the function of the IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The existence of a vacuum at the first pressure level indicates that the integrity of the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is satisfactory. Accordingly, the IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> provides to the engine control unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> an input signal that indicates the integrity of the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, i.e., that there are no leaks. The IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can also relieve pressure below the first pressure level to protect the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, e.g., to prevent the fuel tank <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from collapsing due to excess vacuum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Immediately after the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is turned off, the IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can perform &ldquo;blow off,&rdquo; i.e., relieving excess pressure due to fuel vaporization, and thereby facilitate subsequent vacuum generation that occurs during cooling. During blow off, air within the evaporative system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is released while fuel molecules are retained. Similarly, in the course of refueling the fuel tank <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, relieving excess pressure allows air to exit the fuel tank <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at a high rate of flow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> While the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is turned on, the IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can connect the canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to ambient air, thereby facilitating purge flow from the charcoal canister <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, through the purge valve <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, to the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. While the internal combustion engine <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is turned off, the IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can provide to the engine control unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> the input signal indicating the vacuum level that is generated during cooling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring additionally to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> diagnostic apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for servicing the IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a first fitting <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> that can be occluded by the removable cap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a second fitting <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> that sealingly engages the filler <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. According to one embodiment, the first fitting <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> can be a threaded female member sized to cooperatively receive the removable cap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and the second fitting <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> can be a threaded male member sized to be cooperatively received by the filler <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Thus, the diagnostic apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> incorporates testing for leakage of the removable cap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In fluid communication with the first and second fittings <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is a pressure source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a leak down orifice <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the pressure source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> creates a vacuum, i.e., a negative pressure relative to ambient. A first valve <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> controls fluid communication between the pressure source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the leak down orifice <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. After the pressure source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> establishes in the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> a pressure level that is at or below the predetermined first pressure level, the first valve <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> can be opened and the vacuum in the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be bled down via the leak down orifice <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The pressure source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can include a manually operated hand pump, an electromechanical pump, or some other equivalent device for drawing a vacuum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A second valve <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> can control fluid communication between the pressure source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the second fitting <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. Opening the second valve <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> enables the diagnostic apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to test the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Closing the second valve <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> enables the diagnostic apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to separately test the removable cap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, i.e., by isolating the removable cap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> from the remainder of the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A third valve <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> can control fluid communication between the pressure source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the first fitting <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Closing the third valve <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> enables the diagnostic apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to test the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Opening the third valve <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> enables the diagnostic apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to test the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> including the removable cap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A pressure gauge <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> on the suction side of the pressure source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can measure the pressure level drawn by the pressure source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The pressure gauge <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> can be a low-pressure vacuum gauge, a pressure transducer, or some other equivalent device for measuring a range of pressures that preferably exceeds the operational range of the IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. As an example, the pressure gauge <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may measure pressures that range between approximately one inch of water above ambient pressure and two inches of water below ambient pressure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A method of diagnosing the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and servicing the IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will now be described. First, the cap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is removed from the filler <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> in order to open the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Fluid communication between the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the diagnostic apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is established by matingly engaging the removed cap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> with the first fitting <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, and by matingly engaging the second fitting <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> with the filler <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> To diagnose the integrity of the removable cap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> separate from the rest of the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the first and second valves <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are closed to isolate the pressure source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the first fitting <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, the removable cap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and the pressure gauge <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The pressure source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is operated to draw a vacuum at or below, as indicated by the pressure gauge <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the predetermined first pressure level. Operation of the pressure source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is discontinued and the pressure gauge <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is monitored to detect changes in the pressure drawn by the pressure source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The inability to establish a vacuum at the predetermined first level, or a rising pressure level, as indicated by the pressure gauge <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, are indicative of a flawed removable cap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> To diagnose the integrity of the entire evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, including the removable cap <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, the first valve <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is closed, the second valve <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is opened, and the third valve <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> is opened. The pressure source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is then operated to draw a vacuum at or below, as indicated by the pressure gauge <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the predetermined first pressure level. The inability to establish a vacuum at the predetermined first level is indicative of a gross leak in the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A rising pressure level, as indicated by the pressure gauge <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, is indicative of a leak somewhere in the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The loss of vacuum (magnitude rate) is a rough measure of the leak size. However, there are other influences that can cause a pressure/vacuum change in an otherwise sealed evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, vacuum decay can be caused by the temperature of the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> relative to the ambient temperature, barometric pressure changes, agitation of the vehicle/fuel creating accelerated evaporation, refueling of the fuel tank <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The diagnostic apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can also be used to service the IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, e.g., for verifying switch activity. To cycle the IPMA switch, the pressure source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is operated to draw in the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> a vacuum at which activation of the IPMA switch occurs. Switch activity can be monitored with an electrical meter, e.g., a voltmeter, connected to the switch, or with an output signal from the engine control unit <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The pressure level at which the switch is activated, i.e., the first pressure level, can be measured by the pressure gauge <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The activity of the IPMA switch can continue to be monitored as the first valve <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> is opened to bleed-off through the leak down orifice <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> the vacuum in the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The diagnostic apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can also be used to verify other functions of the IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Specifically, the diagnostic apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be used to negatively or positively pressurize the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Drawing an excessive negative pressure, i.e., a pressure below that required for the IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to perform leak detection, can verify the vacuum relief function of the IPMA <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. And creating a positive pressure in the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can verify the blow-off function of the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Moreover, such a positive pressure test could be used in connection with hydrocarbon sniffer technology and methodology to aid in locating a leak in the evaporative control system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been disclosed with reference to certain preferred embodiments, numerous modifications, alterations, and changes to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the sphere and scope of the present invention, as defined in the appended claims. Accordingly, it is intended that the present invention not be limited to the described embodiments, but that it have the full scope defined by the language of the following claims, and equivalents thereof. </paragraph>
