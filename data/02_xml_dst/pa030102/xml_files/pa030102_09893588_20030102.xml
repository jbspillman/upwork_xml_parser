<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Before beginning a detailed description of the subject invention, mention of the following is in order. When appropriate, like reference numerals and characters may be used to designate identical, corresponding or similar components in differing figure drawings. Further, in the detailed description to follow, example dimensions/models/values/ranges/materials may be given, although the present invention is not limited to the same. Further, arrangements may be shown in simplistic or block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the invention, and also in view of the fact that specifics with respect to implementation of such block diagram arrangements are highly dependent upon the platform within which the present invention is to be implemented, i.e., such specifics should be well within purview of one skilled in the art. Further, where specific details are set forth in order to describe example embodiments of the invention, it should be apparent to one skilled in the art that the invention can be practiced without, or with variation of, these specific details. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The description now turns to explanations useful in an understanding of the present invention. More particularly, the present invention is useful in any type of arrangement wherein it is useful to planarize or level and also pre-under-fill any type of wafer arrangement which has protrusions (e.g., solder bumps), and which may be subjected to a back-grind process. While background and example embodiments of the present invention are described with respect to an example solder-bumped wafer and die, practice of the present invention is not limited thereto (e.g., embodiments of the present invention may have uses with wafers and dies having other types of non-planarities, e.g., wafers and dies having protruding metal interconnect lines, capacitors, etc.). Further, while background and example embodiments of the present invention are described with a very thin die used as a flip chip mounted to a landed substrate, practice of the present invention is not limited thereto (e.g., the present invention may have other uses, such as multi-stacked die arrangements). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Turning now to detailed discussion of example embodiments, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> relates to a simplistic illustration of an example solder-bumped wafer useful in explanation/understanding of background and embodiments of the present invention. More particularly, illustrated is a bumped wafer arrangement <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, for example, a solder-bumped wafer constructed of a substrate (e.g., a semiconductor wafer) <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> having a circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> protruding therefrom. The bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be of any size, for example, may have a height within a range of 30-150 &mgr;m, or more specifically, 120 &mgr;m, and may have a width within any range, for example, such as 30-170 &mgr;m, or more specifically, 150 &mgr;m. Oftentimes in semiconductor manufacturing, it is desirable to polish or grind down a backside of the substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> such that an overall thickness of the substrate <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> becomes much thinner, e.g., 125 &mgr;m. The advantage of grinding to a very thin substrate is that any resultant die devices may be more compactly mounted within an end package, thereby reducing size, weight, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Several situations require special considerations with respect to back-grinding substrates. More particularly, as one consideration, care must be taken such that byproducts from the back<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> grind process do not contaminate the circuit surface. For example, non-conductive particles from the back-grind process may interfere with subsequent electrical conduction interconnections between conductive arrangements (e.g., between a conductive solder bump and a substrate land). As another example, conductive particles may cause short-circuiting between electrical circuits of the circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Still further, chemicals from the back-grind process may have a disadvantageous chemical effect on the circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Thus, it is important that the circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> be adequately protected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As another consideration, some type of arrangement must be used as a holding mechanism to hold the bump wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in place while a back-grind process is applied thereto. Oftentimes, a tape arrangement (e.g., an adhesive tape) is applied to the bumped wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for the dual purpose of holding the bumped wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in place while a back-grind process is applied, and providing surface protection (e.g., from contaminants) to the circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates an example embodiment in dashed-line form of a tape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having an adhesive thereon, which sticks to any bump <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> coming into contact therewith. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> While the tape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a simple adhesive thereon works well with respect to planar wafers, such tape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> does not work well with bumped wafers for a number of reasons. As one reason, the tape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not sufficiently fluid/flexible to dip within the valleys between the bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and accordingly, substantial air gaps <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) are formed between neighboring bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and the tape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The problem is that insufficient circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> protection is provided, in that byproducts (e.g., non-conductive particles, conductive particles and chemicals) from the back-grind process can enter the air gaps <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight>, to be disadvantageously contained therein. As a further problem, the albeit-limited flexibility of the tape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> allows it to dip slightly down in between neighboring bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, resulting in a wavy, non-planar tape surface. The problem with the non-planar tape surface is that, when pressure is applied during the back-grind process, such pressure will be applied significantly unevenly across the bumped wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and as the wafer is thinned during the back-grind process, mechanical damage such as cracking of the wafer often occurs. Such may also disadvantageously enlarge a total wafer thickness variation after a back-grind process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Still further, during the bump manufacturing process, oftentimes the resultant bumps (e.g., solder bumps) have significant height differentials between the respective bumps. Any bump having a significantly higher height difference than neighboring bumps runs the risk of being a point of highly-localized pressure from the back-grind process, resulting in dimpling (not shown) and/or cracking (not shown) of the bumped wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as it becomes thinned during the back-grind process. That is, the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> tape <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> arrangement provides inferior compensation for differences with respect to bump height between the respective bumps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Discussion now turns to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. More particularly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> relates to a simplistic illustration of an example flexible-layer taped wafer useful in explanation/understanding of background and embodiments of the present invention. More particularly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is directed to a surface protection tape having a flexible or conforming layer which attempts to overcome the shortcomings of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> arrangement, e.g., attempts to avoid mechanical wafer damage such as wafer breakage and dimpling of the wafer backside, provide compensation for differences in bump height, and provide protection to the circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from contamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Turning to more detailed discussion, the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> wafer arrangement <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> includes a surface protection tape <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> which includes a backing layer <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and a flexible or conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. With respect to the flexible/conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, such layer should be composed of an adhesive material having conforming characteristics such that, as the conforming protection surface tape <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is applied to the bumped wafer, the result is a taped wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, wherein the conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is substantially conformed to the bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. More specifically, turning attention briefly to the magnified view in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, there is illustrated a disadvantageous arrangement wherein a conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>&prime; has conforming characteristics which are too stiff, such that the conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>&prime; dips insufficiently between neighboring bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> such that there is still resultant air gaps <highlight><bold>1445</bold></highlight>. Again, such air gaps <highlight><bold>1445</bold></highlight> allow byproducts from the back-grind process to potentially contaminate the circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> illustrates a more advantageous arrangement wherein the conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>&prime; has conforming characteristics which are sufficiently flexible so as to substantially completely dip between neighboring bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> such that there are negligible air gaps <highlight><bold>1445</bold></highlight>&prime; formed. A result of the flexible/conforming layer is a taped arrangement having improved planarity over that of the simple adhesive tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Returning discussion to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, once the conforming surface protection tape <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is completely applied to the wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the tape <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is used to hold the wafer during the back-grind process and, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> back-grind process <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is shown being applied to result in a back-grind or thinned wafer <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>&prime;. After the back-grind process <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is completed, the conforming surface protection tape <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is removed, to result in a de-taped, thinned bumped wafer <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The conforming surface protection tape arrangement is disadvantageous in a number of ways. As a first disadvantage, a thickness of the flexible/conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> must be carefully chosen in relation to a height of the bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in order for the approach to provide somewhat satisfactory results. For example, in the aforementioned example of a bump height of 120 &mgr;m, a suitable flexible/conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> thickness may be approximately 150 &mgr;m. If the flexible/conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> thickness is incorrectly selected, non-planar features such as the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> dips <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> and rises or swellings <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> may occur, to result in the aforementioned localized pressure, e.g., dimpling and breakage, problems. As the flexible/conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> must be chosen to be carefully related to the bump height, disadvantageously, a large inventory of conforming surface protection tapes <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> having varying flexible/conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> thicknesses must be maintained. Even if the flexible/conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> thickness is carefully chosen with respect to a majority of areas of the bumped wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, sporadic non-planar features such as dips <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> and rises <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> still may occur. Accordingly, special back-grind handling is required with respect to the conforming surface protection tape arrangement, in that grinding/polishing rates are very sensitive to surface planarity of the taped wafer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, as a result of the above disadvantages, manufacturing is slowed and costs are increased as time must be taken to carefully select a thickness of the flexible/conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, and then a slower, more careful back-grind process must be applied. If dips <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> or rises <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> do occur, or if insufficiently careful back-grinding is applied to the conforming surface protection tape arrangement, a result may very well be a thinned wafer having, or being prone to, mechanical damage. More particularly, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates a thinned wafer <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> wherein, instead of having a uniform thickness goal of 125 &mgr;m across the wafer, a thickness <highlight><bold>412</bold></highlight> thereof is unequal. Such an unequal-thickness wafer is subjected to differing stresses along a body thereof during subsequent back-grinding, de-taping, dicing, die mounting and circuit operation, so there is a significant potential for thinned wafer cracking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As a further disadvantage, the conforming surface protection tape is very difficult to remove during a required de-taping operation. More specifically, once the conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> has conformed to (e.g., surrounds) the bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, such bumps act as anchors. That is, adhesion and suction forces make it difficult to remove the conforming surface protection tape <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and may result in localized pressures during the de-taping process. A very distinct possibility is breakage of the thinned wafer <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> A further disadvantage of the conforming surface protection tape arrangement is that of leftover residue. More specifically, due to the aforementioned adhesion and suction characteristics of the conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, fragments <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) of the conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may be left on the bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or the circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Such residue requires further cleaning (e.g., such as washing) of the thinned wafer <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. Additional washing results in additional manufacturing time and costs, and subjects the circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to additional stresses and exposure. Inadequate cleaning and any un-removed residue <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> may disadvantageously affect any subsequent die bonding or mounting operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Discussion now turns to example embodiments of the present invention. More specifically, attention is directed to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, illustrating a planarized/pre-back-filled bumped wafer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the bumped wafer <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> has a planarized/pre-back-filled coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> applied thereto. Such coating may, for example, be a polymer coating applied via a non-conductive or anisotropic film/paste. Still further, the coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> may be a thermoplastic material. The coating may be applied through any known technique, for example, via a non-exhaustive listing including: a flow process, an injection molding, or a hot vacuum lamination. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> shows an arrangement <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> wherein the coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> completely covers, i.e., is thicker in thickness than, the bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> shows an alternative arrangement wherein the coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>&prime; is applied to have a thickness which is level with or slightly thinner than a height of the bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> such that the tops of the bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are accessible. Advantages of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> arrangement is that the exposed bump <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> areas can serve as adhesion points for an adhesive tape (especially where a non-adhering thermoset coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>&prime; is used), and the exposed bump portions remain uncontaminated by the coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>&prime; so as to possibly result in better bonding thereof with any interconnecting lands. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>&prime; again may be a polymer coating, and may be either a thermoplastic or thermoset polymer. Use of thermoplastic or thermoset coatings is advantageous in that thermoplastic and thermoset molding technology on bumped-surface wafers already exists in the semiconductor industry, for example, is used in the encapsulation of wafer-level packages. As an alternative, the coating, instead of being a thermoplastic or thermoset material, may instead be able to be of a material capable of light curing or chemical curing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As a further possible advantageous arrangement, the coating may be opaque, so as to protect the circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> from undesirable influences such as light, or ultraviolet (UV) light or radiation. Use of an opaque coating may be advantageous in that a tape (discussed hereinafter) which is curable via UV light may be used so as to be easily removable from a thinned wafer. As an alternative to opaqueness, the coating may instead be of a transparent material so as to allow light, UV light or radiation to travel thereto, so as to be applied to the circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, or alternatively, to travel from the circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> toward any substrate or other circuit bonded to the resultant bumped die. As a further alternative, the coating may be selectively opaque in some regions and selectively transparent in other regions. Further, while the coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>&prime; should generally be of a non-conductive material, the coating may contain conductive areas if appropriate, e.g., to provide electrical conduction paths between differing areas of the circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, or between the circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and a substrate or circuit bonded to the resultant bumped die. The coating also may have other characteristics which provide other types of protection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The planarized/pre-back-filled coating arrangements of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> are advantageous in that the coating layer <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>&prime; provides compensation for bump height differences, and an improved planar (or leveled) surface allows applied pressure to be uniform across the wafer during the back-grind process. Further, the thickness of the coating can be changed quickly and easily in real time during the manufacturing process by simply changing an amount of coating material applied to the bumped wafer <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Further, planar surface enhancing procedures also may be applied to further enhance the uniform planar surface of the planarized/backfilled bumped wafer, e.g., vibration may be applied to planarize the coating, or a sufficient time may be allowed for planarizing flow of the coating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Continuing discussion with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, once a coating has been applied and sufficiently planarized, a tape <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> with adhesive is applied to the wafer <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> for surface protection. If the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference> arrangement is used, then a simple adhesive tape may be applied. If the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> arrangement is used, then a simple adhesive tape may be used, or alternatively, a conforming tape with a flexible/conforming layer to provide further planarizing compensation for the slightly exposed bumps may be used. The result is a taped/planarized/backfilled bumped wafer <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>&prime; having a superior planar surface (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>). The bumped wafer <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>&prime; then has the back-grind process <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> applied thereto. Due to the superior planarizing of the above-described approach, the bumped wafer <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>&prime; can effectively be treated as a non-bumped wafer during any back-grind process, such that general back-grinding without special precautions can be quickly and easily performed, with shorter manufacturing time. Further, due to the increased stiffness provided by the planarized/pre-backfilled coating, a strength of the back-grind or thinned wafer <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>&prime; is advantageously enhanced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Once the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> back-grinding process <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> is completed, a de-taping process can be applied, to result in the de-taped, thinned bumped wafer <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. With respect to de-taping, as mentioned previously, if the coating is advantageously of an opaque material, UV light can be applied to remove any UV-curable adhesive tape, so as to make the tape <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> more easily removable with lessened pressure, so as to further minimize any mechanical damage potential to the thinned bumped wafer <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>. The end result is the thinned bumped wafer <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>, having a thickness <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> of, for example, 125 &mgr;m, and which possibly can be made even thinner (e.g., &lE;100 &mgr;m) than the aforementioned background approaches, owing to the increased stiffness afforded by the coating, and which is more equal throughout its area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Turning now to discussion of a further difference from the aforementioned FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> background approaches, unlike the conforming layer <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> being removed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), the coating layer <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>&prime; remains on the thinned bumped wafer <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. Again, the coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>&prime; continues to provide the advantage of increased stiffness to the thinned bump wafer <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>, so as to advantageously continue to provide increased mechanical damage protection (and possible optical protection (if opaque)) to the wafer during subsequent handling. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> Further, it should be apparent at this point that the coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>&prime; should advantageously be made of a suitable under-fill material. More specifically, discussion now turns to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, which relates to a simplistic illustration of an example diced die from the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> wafer being used in an example flip chip manner, in preparation for bonding to a substrate, and still maintaining the pre-backfill coating of the present invention. That is, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>, the thinned bump wafer <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> has been diced, and a single die <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>&prime; has been flipped together with its planarized/pre-backfill coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>&prime;, and aligned with, for example, a printed wiring board (PWB) <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, so as to begin a flip chip mounting process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> More specifically, the PWB <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> includes a substrate <highlight><bold>960</bold></highlight> and flip chip lands <highlight><bold>970</bold></highlight>, which are aligned with respective bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the die <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>&prime;. It should be noted with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> that no additional adhesive is applied to either the bumped die <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>&prime; or the PWB <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight>, i.e., the planarizing/pre-backfill coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>&prime; will be used to effect the flip chip assembly bonding. More specifically, the die <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>&prime; and PWB <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> are brought together, and heat and pressure are then applied so as to plasticize the coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>&prime; such that the coating will flow and under-fill areas between the bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and flip chip lands <highlight><bold>970</bold></highlight>, while allowing opposing bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and lands <highlight><bold>970</bold></highlight> to electrically interconnect. As a further advantage, because the bumps are covered with a coating (e.g., a polymer), before flip chip interconnection solder, solder flow is controlled even without resist. Such enables flip chip joining on copper foil even where pads have not been patterned. Once the heating is removed, the plasticized coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> de-plasticizes, so as to cause the die <highlight><bold>800</bold></highlight>&prime; and PWB <highlight><bold>900</bold></highlight> to adhere to one another. The result is the very thin die flip chip assembly <highlight><bold>1000</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Discussion turns next to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. More specifically, discussions with respect to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> would substantially parallel the discussions with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> and, accordingly, redundancy is omitted for the sake of brevity. The differences between FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> versus <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</cross-reference> are that the thinner coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>&prime; of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> is illustrated/used together with an additional adhesive layer <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>) for use in the flip chip assembly process. The adhesive layer <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> can be made of any suitable material, e.g., may be made of the same material as the coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>&prime;, such as a thermoplastic or thermoset polymer. As advantages, the adhesive coating <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> is used to compensate for the fact that the planarized/pre-backfill coating <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>&prime; does not completely cover the bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, and additional under-fill material is needed to fill in areas between the flip chip lands <highlight><bold>970</bold></highlight> and/or the remaining height of the bumps <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. The adhesive coating <highlight><bold>1250</bold></highlight> thus effectively serves as a secondary under-fill layer. The final result is the alternative very thin die flip chip assembly <highlight><bold>1300</bold></highlight>, as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Applicant&apos;s invention, including the planarized/backfill coating, provides at least the following, non-exhaustive advantages with respect to the back-grinding and mounting operations: pre-backfilling at an early stage of manufacturing; improved planarizing (or leveling) of the bumped wafer; improved and continued surface protection to the circuit surface <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> throughout the back-grinding and subsequent mounting operations via the pre-backfill material; improved stiffening/strengthening of the wafer and die throughout the back-grinding and mounting operations via the pre-backfill material; improved light/UV/radiation protection to the circuit surface throughout the back-grinding and mounting operations via the pre-backfill material; and a easily-stored and versatile coating material having an application thickness which is easily controlled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> In concluding, reference in the specification to &ldquo;one embodiment&rdquo;, &ldquo;an embodiment&rdquo;, &ldquo;example embodiment&rdquo;, etc., means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of such phrases in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with any embodiment, it is submitted that it is within the purview of one skilled in the art to effect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other ones of the embodiments. Furthermore, for ease of understanding, certain method procedures may have been delineated as separate procedures; however, these separately delineated procedures should not be construed as necessarily order dependent in their performance, i.e., some procedures may be able to be performed in an alternative ordering, simultaneously, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> This concludes the description of the example embodiments. Although the present invention has been described with reference to a number of illustrative embodiments thereof, it should be understood that numerous other modifications and embodiments can be devised by hose skilled in the art that will fall within the spirit and scope of the principles of this invention. More particularly, reasonable variations and modifications are possible in the component parts and/or arrangements of the subject combination arrangement within the scope of the foregoing disclosure, the drawings and the appended claims without departing from the spirit of the invention. In addition to variations and modifications in the component parts and/or arrangements, alternative uses will also be apparent to those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> For example, while the above example embodiments are described as applying a back-grind process to a layered wafer and then dicing the wafer to achieve individual die, it is envisioned that such operations may be reversed, i.e., the layered wafer may first be subjected to dicing to achieve individual die, and then individual die subjected to a back-grind process. This is advantageous in situations where only certain types of die from a multi-die-type wafer need to be back-grinded. Further, there is envisioned a multi-stage back-grind process where back-grind process is first applied to a layered wafer, then dicing of the wafer to achieve individual die, and finally, individual die subjected to a further back-grind process. Note that such multi-stage back-grind process may be made possible by the extra rigidity support provided by the pre-back-grind under-fill layer of the present invention.</paragraph>
