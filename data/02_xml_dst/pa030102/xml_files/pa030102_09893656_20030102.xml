<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention generally relates to online business models and, more particularly, is concerned with an online postcard order and creation system. The term &ldquo;postcard&rdquo; is used herein in a generic sense as inclusive of all types of printed cards. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Various systems are installed at commercial websites accessible on the Internet where customers can login and either furnish an electronic image and message or select one provided by the website. The electronic image and message are then employed by the system to create an electronic postcard, an e-card, for the customer. After the e-card is created, the customer then can have it transmitted over the Internet to a target party&apos;s e-mail address. One e-card creation system that is accessed through the Internet is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,018,774 to Mayle et al. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> However, prior art systems do not permit the creation of postcards by utilizing printing industry standard four-color web offset printing from an original online order. Instead, current systems generate postcards at 72 dpi producing a low-resolution image that can be captured and e-mailed easily and even set to four-color printing, but the final product will still be a 72 dpi printed image. The quality of this image is viewed substandard in the printing industry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Consequently, there is a need for an innovation that will overcome problems of prior art online systems for ordering and generating postcards without introducing new problems in place thereof. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an online postcard order and creation system which satisfies the aforementioned needs. The online system of the present invention includes at least one and preferably both of two different online order creation subsystems for allowing online ordering and creating of postcards by novice customers and professional customers. The system also facilitates four-color web offset printing from an original online order at printing industry standards of the resolution and line screen of the image, such as 355 dpi and 245 line screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, the present invention is directed to an online postcard order and creation system which comprises: (a) an online site server; (b) a user login subsystem by which a novice customer creates an account and logs into the online site server; (c) a novice order creation subsystem accessible and employed by a logged-in novice customer who chooses to place an order and create a postcard online by selecting an image from a database in the online site server having a library of offered images; and (d) an order tracking subsystem which is accessible by a customer to view the status of a submitted order. Furthermore, the novice customer further chooses to place the order and create the postcard online by selecting and previewing a layout of the postcard front and back and entering the customer order and billing details for the created postcard into the online site server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention also is directed to an online postcard order and creation system which comprises: (a) an online site server; (b) a user login subsystem by which a professional customer create an account and logs into the online site server; (c) a professional order creation subsystem accessible and employed by a logged-in customer who chooses to place an order and create the postcard by submitting press-ready artwork of the postcard; and (d) an order tracking subsystem which can be accessed by a professional customer to view the status of a submitted order. The press-ready artwork is submitted by the professional customer via File Transfer Protocol format. The professional customer further chooses to place an order and create the postcard by entering customer order and billing details for the created postcard into the online site server. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The online system further comprises an administrative control subsystem which allows internal staff to view, report and edit customer orders and account data stored in the online site server and employed in the operation of the order creation subsystems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the drawings wherein there is shown and described an illustrative embodiment of the invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings and particularly to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is a diagram illustrating an online postcard order and creation system of the present invention, generally designated <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The diagram illustrates the workflow relationship between components of the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and its interfaces. The online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> supports online order capturing and backend system interfacing. The various components of the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> include an online site server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, an user login subsystem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, a novice order creation subsystem <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a professional order creation subsystem <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, an order tracking subsystem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and an administrative control subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further includes a plurality of interfaces <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> disposed between the aforementioned components and an external database <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and backend systems <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Requirements of the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are defined in terms of a set of Actors and Use Cases involved in the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. An actor is an entity external to the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> that acts upon it and has requirements of the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in the form of the Use Cases. Actors are broken into two categories: the external backend systems <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and users <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Users <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are customers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and an administrator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. A customer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is a user who places an order with the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and, more specifically, may be a novice customer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> or a professional customer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The novice customer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is one who has opened an online account and chooses to place an order using the novice order creation subsystem <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The professional customer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is one who has opened an online account and chooses to place an order using the professional order creation subsystem <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Both customers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> use a conventional personal computer or the like and a conventional online service provider to access the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a conventional manner via the Internet. Both customers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> also use the user login subsystem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to create an account and log onto the online site server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The administrator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is an authorized internal user with the need to report on orders and access customer information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The interfaces <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> between the components of the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the external database <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and backend systems <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are as follows: a job number import subsystem <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, an order details export subsystem <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, an order status import subsystem <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and a file upload subsystem <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. In the operation of the job number import subsystem <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, a batch of job numbers is reserved and exported from the external database <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> to the online site server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for import and allocation to incoming orders by the online site server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In the operation of the order details export subsystem <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, order data is written to a delimited text file whenever an order is created by the online site server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Each order is written to a separate file, and these files are read into the external database <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> by a periodic batch process. In the operation of the order status import subsystem <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, order status updates are exported from the external database <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> hourly and read into the online site server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the operation of the file upload subsystem <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, files provided by the customer <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are made available to the processes of the backend systems <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is illustrated a sequence of stages addressed by a novice customer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in using the novice order creation subsystem <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The novice customer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is required to login, as per block <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, on the user login subsystem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> upon reaching and commencing the final step of the sequence. A visitor to the site of the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> must login in order to identify their user session to the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and complete the order creation process. The sequence of stages of the novice order creation subsystem <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes, first, select image, as per block <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, next, select and preview layout, as per block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, and, finally, enter order details, as per block <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The user login, as per block <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, presents an initial screen to the user, offering the user the option of entering the username and password to an existing account, or alternatively electing to create a new account. If the user enters a username and password, and selects &ldquo;Login&rdquo;, these fields will be compared with existing accounts in the database of the online site server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. If there is no matching existing account, the user will be warned that these details are incorrect, and is offered the alternative of either retrying or creating a new account. If the details match an existing account, this account is associated with this user for the duration of the session. If the user wishes to create a new account with the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the following information must be elicited from and submitted by the user: (1) desired username; (2) password and password verification; (3) email address; and (4) whether the user wishes to receiving mailings. Once submitted, the username is checked against the system database of the online site server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and rejected along with an error message if not unique. If accepted, the user account is created and the user logged into this account for the duration of this session. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> When the user is successfully logged in, a page is displayed on the user&apos;s computer screen listing any existing orders in the system, along with the user name associated with this session. If the order is incomplete, the user may select the order and continue the process from the stage of layout preview, as per block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. If the order has been submitted, the user may select the order to review the current order status. The user may logout from the current account and login to a different account or create a new account at any time. Also, returning users with accounts are recognized by the server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and welcomed by username when they start a session. If the user is logged on and abandons the novice order creation subsystem <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> at any stage before it is complete, all design information is preserved in the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and is available next time the user logs on to that account. Should a non-logged on user wish to abandon the novice order creation subsystem <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and return later on to continue therewith, the status of the user&apos;s design is preserved in the system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and referenced by use of a cookie on the user&apos;s computer, and the user may recommence from where the user left off when the user returns to the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The select image stage, as per block <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, of the subsystem <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> involves the user or online novice customer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> selecting an image from a library of offered images from the system database in the server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The online novice order is not considered to have been &ldquo;started&rdquo; and will not be linked to the account as an incomplete order should the user abandon the process until at least an image has been selected. Several screens guide the user through the process of selecting an image. The main page displays a list of all image categories. The user may click on any category to link to the set of images in that category. The set of images in a category are displayed to the user on a series of pages. A number of images are displayed in a grid on each page, with links to the subsequent and preceding pages in the set. The following information is displayed for each image: thumbnail image and title. When the user selects a particular image from the result set page, an image detail page is displayed showing the following information on the image: the full-sized preview image, title and optional descriptive text. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The select and preview layout, as per block <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, of the subsystem <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provides a means of defining, previewing and refining the format and layout of the postcard. The user must be able to randomly access and modify any of these settings. The user may change the currently selected image at any time. The user also may change the back-of-postcard template at any time, but doing so will discard all template field text settings. The following information defines the postcard front: selected image, is headline required&quest;, headline text, headline font, and headline color. A graphical preview of the front of the postcard, displaying the selected image at full size is shown to the user. The user is able to select headline options. The preview is updated to reflect the settings as they are made by the user. The following information defines the postcard back: back of postcard template, selected font, text for each template field, and optional text describing any special requirements. To layout the back of the postcard, the user selects a template defining the back of the postcard layout. Thumbnails of all available templates are displayed on a selection page. When a thumbnail is selected, a full-sized graphical preview of the back of the postcard, displaying sample text in each template text field, is displayed. A list of available fonts is displayed for the user to select from. The user is able to enter text for each template field. The preview is updated to display the text for each field as it is entered, and font selection if it is changed. The user may additionally enter text describing any special requirements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The enter order data stage, as per block <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, of the subsystem <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> involves the novice customer <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> entering order and billing details in order for such user to lodge the online order. Costs relating to selected layout options are displayed to the user, along with the quantity and size options and costs for the user to select from. The user must select: order quantity and product size/type. The user must login now by following the steps described previously. Also, the customer&apos;s shipping and billing details must be provided. If the customer has previously completed an order details form, defaults are available for all of these fields, recorded from the last time the user entered them. These fields are: customer name; billing address, city, state and zip code; shipping address, city, state and zip code; home, office and fax phone numbers; and payment type. If the payment type selected is a credit card, and the customer has previously entered credit card details, details are displayed of each credit card the user has previously given (with only the last 4 digits of the credit card number visible). The user may select the credit card the user wishes to bill this order to, or enter the details of a new credit card. The following credit card details are required to bill the order to a credit card: credit card type; credit card number; expiration date; and name of the credit card holder. The order summary is displayed to the user as follows: job number allocated to this order; customer name and number; order quantity, product size and type; shipping address; total order cost; and payment type. The user reviews and agrees to accept terms and conditions of the transaction. Also, the customer must confirm the order and conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is illustrated the sequence of stages addressed by a professional customer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in using the professional order creation subsystem <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The professional customer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> will submit an order using the professional order creation subsystem <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. This subsystem <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> involves the professional customer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> submitting press-ready artwork, rather than selecting artwork from the library in the database of the site server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The user login, as per block <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, is carried out substantially the same as described earlier in connection with the novice order creation subsystem <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The sequence of stages of the professional order creation subsystem <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes, first, provide directions, as per block <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, next, enter order details, as per block <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and, finally, either file upload, as per block <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, or manual file submission, as per block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In view that the professional user or customer <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> must submit the press-ready artwork that the user wishes to have used in the order, the provide directions stage, as per block <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, of the subsystem <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> requires the professional user to submit information directions and instructions regarding the intended submission. The user may indicate after logging in that the user wishes to resubmit files for an existing order. If such be the case, then submission instructions are displayed. Otherwise, the following information must be elicited from the user: computer type (Mac or Windows); and selected submission method, either file upload stage, as per block <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, or manual submission stage, as per block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, of subsystem <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The user is then presented with a list of formats and preconditions that the user&apos;s artwork must meet in order to be processed. Links for instructions to correctly format the user&apos;s files using a variety of applications are displayed to the user. A preflight checklist is displayed to the user. Each point must be checked before the user may continue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The enter order details stage, as per block <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, of the subsystem <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is carried out substantially the same as described earlier in connection with the novice order creation subsystem <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The file upload stage, as per block <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, and the manual file submission stage, as per block <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, of the subsystem <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> have been discussed above. The user submits the file the user wishes to be used in the professional order using FTP. This process does not directly involve the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The manual file submission is an offline process, not involving the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the order tracking subsystem <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> allows the customers <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to able to view online the status of all orders that they have submitted to the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The user selects &ldquo;view order status&rdquo; and in response the customer number and job number is requested from the user. Instructions are available explaining how this information can be found. The online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> finds the matching order. If no such match is found, an error message is displayed. The following order status information is displayed for the selected order: order description; order details; current status of the order; and customer service contact information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring still to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the administrative control subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> allows internal staff of the company providing the online system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to view, report and edit data in the database of the online site server <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The tasks performed by the administrator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> relate to order reporting and customer administration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> With respect to order reporting, the database has information stored for each order. This information includes: an identifying job number; configured novice subsystem preview; selected size and type; selected quantity; customer associated with this order; and billing details. The administrator <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is able to view order details by selecting a specific order from the result set of orders matching the selected criteria. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> With respect to customer administration, the administrative control subsystem <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provides a means for viewing, browsing and search customer account data. Information associated with each customer includes: username; customer number; company name; email address; work phone number; fax number &amp; note; address, city, state and zip code for billing address; address, city, state and zip code for shipping address; credit card details; whether user wishes to receive mailings; notes about this customer; and orders for this customer.
