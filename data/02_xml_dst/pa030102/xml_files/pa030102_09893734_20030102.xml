<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to messaging. Specifically, this invention relates to a system and method for unified messaging. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. General Background and Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The field of messaging has evolved rapidly in recent years, due in large part to advancements in telecommunications technologies. Messaging services, which ensure that messages from a sender are delivered to an absent recipient, have become ubiquitous. Such services include messaging devices intended for home use, such as answering machines or computers equipped with telephonic functions, as well as messaging services offered by service providers, such as voicemail boxes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Messaging technologies manage recorded messages. Specifically, messages may be accessed in analog form or digital form and retrieved based on various criteria, such as date or time. Unified messaging integrates messaging capabilities on different platforms and enables a user to access and retrieve messages recorded in different modalities and on different platforms. For example, a user may retrieve conventional voice messages via an e-mail box. Similarly, a user may listen to e-mail messages which are read aloud by a text-to-speech (TTS) engine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Caller ID, a service offered by service providers, sends identifying information of a caller to a callee when the caller places a call. A messaging system may record caller ID data along with a message left by the callee. As such, messages may be indexed and accessed according to caller ID data. For instance, when a voice message is sent to an email box, the associated caller ID data may be sent as well. The caller ID data may be recorded as sender information to facilitate sorting and processing of incoming messages. Additionally, when an e-mail message is read to a user via a TTS engine, the caller ID data may also be read. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Such uses of caller ID are very limited, merely employing caller ID data to facilitate search and retrieval of messages. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore, what is needed is a method and system that uses caller ID data in conjunction with a wider range of messaging functions.</paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> A method and system for an interactive unified messaging device, as described herein, involves receiving a call by an interactive unified messaging device. The caller is identified by caller ID information conveyed with the call. A configuration for the caller is retrieved based on the caller ID information. The call is then responded to based on the configuration of the caller. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> A caller may include a party that, for example, places a telephone call or sends an e-mail message. Caller ID information may include a host of information, such as a telephone number, an e-mail address, the name of a caller, or the name of an organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a high-level diagram of system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the present invention. System <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> comprises public switched telephone network (PSTN) <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, Internet access device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, input device <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>, and telephone <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> receives a call originating from PSTN <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The call conveys caller ID data <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and other signals, such as audio signals. A configuration for the caller may have been previously stored and associated with the caller&apos;s caller ID data <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As such, messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may retrieve the stored configuration using a portion or all of the caller ID data <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> as an index. Messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may then respond to the call based on the retrieved configuration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> If no caller ID data is available, or the conveyed data does not match to an existing configuration, default rules or configurations may be used to respond to the call. Such rules may be defined by software, user inputs, or a combination thereof. An exemplary default rule may include forwarding the call to voicemail. Alternatively, a user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, at the time of a call, may be prompted for an input that specifies how the call should be handled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Processing of the caller ID data and retrieval of a stored configuration, default rules, or user input may occur before telephone <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> rings. Software and firmware in messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be automatically updated via an Internet connection or automated telephone calls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Input device <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight> may comprise, for example, a keypad, a mouse and keyboard, or a voice recognition input mechanism in a personal computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Telephone <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> may comprise, for example, a telephone, a cordless telephone, a telephone handset, or a telephonic device within a computer. In some embodiments, telephone <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> may merely convey voice signals between messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may maintain a direct connection with PSTN <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> or act as an intermediary between PSTN <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and telephone <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, telephone <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be integrated into one device. Additionally, telephone <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> may include a display, a text-to-speech (TTS) processor, or a Braille-based input/output mechanism for visually impaired individuals. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> System <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may comprise Internet access device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Internet access device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may comprise a computer configured to access the Internet <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. Messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> interfaces with Internet access device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> over a connection, such as over a local area network (LAN). Via the Internet <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, Internet access device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> may access a host of information resources, such as, for example, voicemail server <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and e-mail server <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. As such, messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may provide unified messaging capabilities to user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, wherein messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may transmit to, and receive from, other Internet-connected systems, voicemail messages, e-mail messages, or other such information. Messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may transmit and receive other types of data. For instance, messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may transmit and receive voice signals in a Voice over IP (VoIP) connection between messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and other local and remote nodes. It is to be understood that the present invention may be incorporated into various other settings, such as intranets or PBX-based networks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> System <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may also include personal access device <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. Personal access device <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may include a personal computer, a cellular phone, a handheld computing device, or another such device that may control and interact with messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Personal access device <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may comprise a device that interfaces with messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> locally, remotely, or both. It is to be noted that a number of such personal access devices <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> may be interfaced with messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may issue commands to messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, receive messages or status information from messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, or effectuate other such exchanges of information. For instance, a user may request status information, input or change a configuration of messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, access individual messages, skip messages, play messages, or forward messages, via Internet access device <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, to a remote node connected to Internet <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a high-level block diagram of messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the present invention. Messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may comprise receiver <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, configuration retriever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, response agent <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, configurator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, and configuration storage unit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. It is to be appreciated that configuration storage unit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, as well as various other components within messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, may reside in one or more external locations if messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may access those locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Receiver <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> receives a call originating from PSTN <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> that conveys caller ID data <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. Receiver <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may parse caller ID data <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to extract information, such as the name of a caller, that may be used by configuration storage unit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to index configurations. Configuration retriever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> receives caller ID data <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> as input. Caller ID data <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> may comprise caller ID data extracted from caller ID data <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> by receiver <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Using caller ID data <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> as an index, configuration retriever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may access configuration storage unit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Response agent <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may take appropriate action based on configuration information retrieved by configuration retriever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>. Apart from accesses it may make in conjunction with received calls, configuration retriever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may also scan configuration storage unit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> to determine whether actions should be taken with respect to a configuration stored in configuration storage unit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. For example, configuration retriever <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> may find that a configuration associated with user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> indicates that a call should be placed to another party at a prescribed time. Response agent <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> may then place the call at the prescribed time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Configuration storage unit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may store a set of configurations associated with caller ID information. Accordingly, a configuration may be associated with any entity, such as an individual or an organization. For example, configuration storage unit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may maintain a configuration for &ldquo;Public, John Q.&rdquo; Each configuration may involve various operations or functions, settings, or parameters that may be invoked with respect to a particular caller. In some embodiments, one configuration may exist for each set of caller ID data. In other embodiments, multiple configurations may be set up for one set of caller ID data, with only one configuration being active at a given time. In still other embodiments, configuration storage unit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> may store a configuration for user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. Such a configuration may include special options, such as wake-up call functions, which apply to user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, but not to outside parties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Configurator <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> may set up a configuration for storage in configuration storage unit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Setup may occur automatically, such as through assignment of default actions by the system, manually by user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, or by a combination of system and user interaction. User <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may set up a configuration via input device <highlight><bold>195</bold></highlight>, telephone <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, personal access device <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, or other such mechanisms. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In an exemplary implementation, configurations may contain static and dynamic information associated with caller ID information. For instance, a configuration may specify a ringing pattern. Specifically, an exemplary configuration associated with a caller may specify whether telephone <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> should ring when the caller calls, whether telephone <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> should ring a predetermined number of times, or whether telephone <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> should ring with a distinctive sound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In addition, a configuration may specify customized greetings, recorded by user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> or the system, that may play depending on the time of day of the call, the day of week, the day of the month, the day of the year, or other inputs, such as, for example, inputs from a scheduling application such as Microsoft Outlook. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Further, a configuration may define forwarding behavior. If user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is absent, a call may be forwarded to another telephone number, to voicemail, to e-mail, or to another such destination. Therefore, a user may, specify a mail forwarding option and a mail forwarding address. For instance, a user could specify e-mail and an e-mail address, telephone and a telephone number, or pager and a pager number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Another configuration option may include customizing response behavior based on scheduling information. For example; if user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is on vacation or away from messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> for another activity, voicemail messages may be recorded and attached to e-mail messages as digital audio files. The e-mail messages may be sent to user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> until user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> returns from vacation. Similarly, if the caller associated with a configuration provides, via DTMF tones, voice recognition, or another input method, his or her availability for the day, messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may automatically place a call to the caller when both the caller and user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are available. Additionally, the caller may indicate a time for user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> to return the call, and messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may automatically return the call at the designated time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Priority may affect customized response behavior. For instance, when messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> needs to place callbacks to multiple callers, the order of the calls may be based on priority. Call filtering may be accomplished in various ways. A caller may be associated with information that indicates the caller&apos;s priority; the caller may provide to an access control mechanism (not shown) access control information, such as a password, when placing a call to messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. In other embodiments, the caller&apos;s configuration may include a priority level. As such, messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may differentiate among various callers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> A configuration may also trigger an event reminder, wherein messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> reminds a caller or user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of a specified event. The time and nature of the event, and a mechanism through which the event reminder is to be executed, such as a TTS engine, e-mail, or Braille, may also be specified. The event reminder may be executed at system- or user-designated times before or after the event is to occur, such as at one hour intervals preceding the event and at 10 minute intervals after the event has begun. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> For instance, messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may place a call to an individual having a configuration in configuration storage unit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> two hours before a scheduled luncheon between the individual and user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The voice signals of the call may be generated by a TTS engine, which may remind the individual that &ldquo;You have a luncheon at 12:00 noon with Jane. Speak &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;No&rsquo; to confirm your attendance.&rdquo; Messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may also provide user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> with reminder functions, such as wake-up calls containing a summary of the day&apos;s scheduled activities. Messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may interface with appointment software, such as Microsoft Outlook, to effectuate such functions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, a status or configuration of messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be retrieved and reported on a medium. For instance, a caller&apos;s message may be retrieved from messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> or a remote storage device such as a voicemail server <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, e-mail server <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, or a Web page on a Web server connected to Internet <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. In particular, the caller&apos;s message may be retrieved from an e-mail message, wherein the voice message is attached thereto as a digital audio file. Statistics relating to the caller may also be retrieved from messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, such as the number of calls placed by, or made to, the caller, an average duration of the calls, and preferred callback time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Status of messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may be reported in various ways, such as by playing back voice messages, displaying the status on a display screen coupled to or incorporated within messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, annunciating the status via a TTS engine, and transmitting the status via a Braille-equipped input/output mechanism, a personal computer (PC), or the Internet. It is to be appreciated that personal access device <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> may initiate requests for status information. In certain embodiments, messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> may spontaneously notify user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> about status information, such as via personal access device <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, after a new caller places a first call to user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> may optionally define a new configuration associated with the new caller. Such a configuration may be retrieved when the caller makes subsequent calls to user <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. In another implementation, voice print analysis may be used to identify a caller when the caller&apos;s configuration cannot be retrieved from messaging unit <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> on the basis of caller ID information conveyed with the call. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating method <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> according to an embodiment of the present invention. In item <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, a configuration is set up based on the caller ID information of a caller. The configuration is stored in item <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>.
