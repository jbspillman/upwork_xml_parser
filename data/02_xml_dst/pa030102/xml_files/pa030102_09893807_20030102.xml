<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to semiconductor processing, and in particular to a system for monitoring critical dimensions in a latent image and controlling exposure time, development time and/or post exposure bake time based on data generated from examining the latent image. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Integrated circuits require ever more precise features. Manufacturing more precise features requires more precise control of the surface geometry, such as comers and edges, of features. When feature sizes become smaller, ensuring that exposure time, development time and/or post exposure bake time will produce a pattern with desired critical dimensions on a wafer becomes more important. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The process of manufacturing semiconductors involves creating several patterned layers on and into a substrate that ultimately forms the complete integrated circuit. This layering process creates electrically active regions in and on the semiconductor wafer surface. The precision with which the electrically active regions can be created is important in achieving desired critical dimensions in the chips. Such precision is affected by the ability to control exposure, development and post exposure baking properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> An exposure of a pattern may produce a latent image in a photo resist that, if exposed to inappropriate post exposure development conditions and/or post exposure baking conditions, may not produce desired critical dimensions, thus reducing chip manufacturing efficiency and chip quality. Exposure time can affect such the critical dimensions that will be achieved when a pattern is exposed, as can development properties (e.g., time, temperature) and post exposure bake properties (e.g., time, temperature). One or more patterns may be exposed on several layers formed (e.g., deposited and/or grown) on a wafer. Each such pattern may be affected by variations in a wafer (e.g., center to edge variations). Thus, a first exposure time that can be employed to expose a first pattern on a first layer and achieve acceptable critical dimensions, may not be similarly achieve acceptable critical dimensions for a second pattern on a second layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Similarly, a first set of development properties and/or a first set of post exposure bake properties that can be employed to develop and bake a first pattern on a first layer with acceptable critical dimensions may not similarly achieve acceptable critical dimensions for a second pattern on a second layer, due to wafer to wafer variations, variations between lots of wafers, and/or variations in prior manufacturing steps (e.g., exposure). Uniformity of critical dimensions between layers can improve IC quality leading to higher clocking speeds and resulting improved performance for such ICs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Exposing the photo resist with the mask pattern produces a latent image on the photo resist. The intensity of the light, the length of exposure, and the focusing of the lens affect the properties of the latent image on the resist (e.g., depth of features, width of features, slope of feature edges). Conventionally, the exposure properties (e.g., length of exposure, dose, intensity) were pre-calculated. Such pre-determined calculations may not produce exposure conditions that will yield desired critical dimensions due to, for example, variations between wafers. Thus, patterns may be produced with features that whose critical dimensions do not fall within expected ranges. Departures from expected properties in the latent image produced on the photo resist may produce undesired results in subsequent manufacturing steps (e g., overexposure creating features that are too deep, underexposure creating features that are too shallow). Conventionally, development properties and/or post exposure properties may similarly be pre-calculated, not based on in situ information gathered from the latent image exposed on the photo resist. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key or critical elements of the invention nor is it intended to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a system that facilitates monitoring the exposure of a pattern into a photo resist, and the latent image produced by such exposure, in semiconductor manufacturing. The present invention further provides a system that facilitates generating information from analysis of the light reflected from the latent image in the resist layer and feeding forward such generated information to control a subsequent development process and/or a subsequent post exposure process. Monitoring and controlling the exposure with runtime feedback provides superior exposure control and thus facilitates achieving desired critical dimensions, with substantial uniformity in such critical dimensions between layers. Similarly, controlling subsequent manufacturing processes and/or apparatus based on data collected from monitoring a previous manufacturing process facilitates accounting for variations between wafers and/or variations between exposures, which facilitates achieving desired critical dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> An exemplary system may employ an exposing system that includes one or more light sources arranged to project light onto a latent image exposed on a photo resist. The latent image may include one or more gratings on one or more portions of a wafer, the gratings facilitating analyzing properties of the latent image exposed in the photo resist. The system may also include one or more light sensing devices (e.g., photo detector, photodiode) for detecting light reflected by, and/or allowed to pass through, the latent image and/or one or more gratings in the latent image. The light reflected from, and/or passing through the latent image and/or one or more gratings in the latent image is indicative of at least one parameter of the exposure (e.g., depth dimensions, width dimensions, chemical composition changes). The determined parameters can then be employed to determine properties associated with developing the pattern exposed into the photo resist and feeding forward control information based on such determinations to the subsequent development process. Similarly, the determined parameters can be employed to determine properties associated with baking the pattern exposed into the photo resist and feeding forward control information based on such determinations to the subsequent baking process. Thus, subsequent manufacturing processes can respond to the actual manufacturing results produced in prior manufacturing processes, facilitating calculating more optimal conditions for the subsequent processes, resulting in higher quality, more uniform chips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An exposing system is arranged to facilitate projecting a pattern onto a layer on a wafer. The exposing system may be, for example, a light and lens combination found in a stepper apparatus. It is to be appreciated that any suitable exposing system can be employed with the present invention. Exposure systems may to change exposure conditions including, but not limited to, duration, focus, phase, intensity and dose. Thus, exposure conditions may not be identical from exposure to exposure. Therefore, the results of exposing a pattern into a photo resist layer may vary from exposure to exposure. Further, there may be variations between wafers, again leading to variations between exposures. The latent image produced by an exposure can be analyzed by comparing signatures generated by the light reflected and/or passed through the latent image and/or gratings in the latent image to desired signatures. By comparing desired signatures to measured signatures, runtime feedback can be employed to more precisely control exposure. Similarly, by comparing desired signatures to measured signatures, runtime feed forward information can be generated that facilitates controlling subsequent manufacturing processes. Such feeding back and feeding forward facilitates achieving desired critical dimensions in the pattern to be developed on the wafer, which in turn increases fidelity of image transfer. The increased fidelity can lead to achieving desired critical dimensions, and can further lead to substantial uniformity of critical dimensions between layers, which in turn facilitates achieving higher speeds in such chips. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, the invention comprises the features hereinafter fully described and particularly pointed out in the claims. The following description and the annexed drawings set forth in detail certain illustrative aspects of the invention. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the invention may be employed. Other objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the drawings. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be evident to one skilled in the art, however, that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate description of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> As used in this application, the term &ldquo;component&rdquo; is intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, a set of co-operating computers and/or processes and a computer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that various aspects of the present invention may employ technologies associated with facilitating unconstrained optimization and/or minimization of error costs. Thus, non-linear training systems/methodologies (e.g., back propagation, Bayesian, fuzzy sets, non-linear regression, or other neural networking paradigms including mixture of experts, cerebella model arithmetic computer (CMACS), radial basis functions, directed search networks and function link networks may be employed). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an exposing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is illustrated. The system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can be employed to expose a pattern into a photo resist layer, for example. The system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an illumination source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. An illumination produced by the illumination source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> can be controlled by, for example, modulating power supplied to the illumination source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. The exposing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can also include an illumination modification filter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, (e.g., a pupil filter) which can be employed to modulate the intensity and/or phase of light spatially. The exposing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can also include a lens system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and a lens system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, each of which can be positionally controlled (e.g., vertically) to adjust a focus of a light passing through the lens system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and the lens system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>. The exposing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can also include a mask/reticle <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, which can be employed to expose a pattern <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> on a wafer <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Dimensions of features formed by exposing a pattern into a photo resist using the system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> can thus depend on the configuration of several cooperating elements (e.g., illumination source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, illumination filter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, lenses <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, and reticle <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>) during exposure. Thus, variations between exposures are possible. Conventionally, differences in properties of a latent image exposed into a photo resist may not be accounted for in subsequent manufacturing processes. But the present invention facilitates collecting information concerning the latent image formed in the photo resist, and thus facilitates adapting and controlling subsequent manufacturing processes (e.g., development, post exposure baking) based on such collected information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In one alternative aspect of the present invention, one or more of the illumination source <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, the illumination modification filter <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, the lens system <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, the mask/reticle <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and the lens system <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> can be operably connected to an exposure driving system <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>. The exposure driving system <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> can be operably connected to a scatterometry system <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> such that the scatterometry system <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> can collect signature data and provide feedback/feedforward information concerning the formation of the one or more patterns <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> on the wafer <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. Such feedback/feedforward information can be employed to determine when to end the exposing process, for example. Furthermore, such feedback/feedforward information can be employed in machine learning techniques to adapt future operation of the exposing system <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The signature data can also be employed to control subsequent processes including, but not limited to, development and post exposure baking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> front view of a layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> on a wafer that has been developed, baked and etched is illustrated. The layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes several features that have measurable dimensions. For example, dimensions including, but not limited to, the width <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of a feature, the distance <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> between features, the slope <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the sides of a feature and the height <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> of a feature. The dimensions (e.g., width <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, spacing <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, slope <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, height <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>) depend, at least in part, on the dimensions of features in a latent image exposed into a photo resist during a prior manufacturing process, which image was subsequently employed in development and baking. Conventionally, the range of the dimensions (e.g., width <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, spacing <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, slope <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, height <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>) depended on the range of the dimensions (e.g., width, spacing, slope, height) in the latent image, and adjustments to post exposure processes could not be made post exposure. However, the present invention facilitates measuring dimensions (e.g., width, spacing, slope, height) in the latent image exposed in the photo resist and thus facilitates feeding forward information to post exposure processes that can lead to improved dimensions (e.g., width <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, spacing <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, slope <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, height <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>) on the layer <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, providing improvements over conventional systems in chip quality, reliability and/or uniformity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> front view of an unexposed photo resist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and an exposed resist <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> are illustrated. Dependent on prior manufacturing processes, the unexposed resist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> typically has measured properties including, but not limited to, a width within predetermined width thresholds, a chemical composition within desired chemical composition ranges and a uniformity within predetermined uniformity thresholds. However, although prior manufacturing processes may produce an unexposed resist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> within all tolerances, the prior manufacturing processes may produce an unexposed resist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> with different thickness, chemical compositions and/or uniformities due to variations in the manufacturing processes and/or variations in the wafer upon which the resist is deposited. Thus, it is possible that unexposed resists may have different properties. Thus, when the unexposed resist <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is exposed to a pattern that creates a latent image in the resist, the latent image may have different properties. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> By way of illustration, the exposed resist <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may have a first feature <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> with a first depth and a second feature <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> with a second depth. Scatterometry techniques can be employed to determine, for example, the depths of the features <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> and to determine what, if anything, those depths indicate concerning exposure. Scatterometry techniques can also be employed to determine, based on the depths of the features <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>, for example, development times and/or temperatures and/or post exposure bake times and/or temperatures to be applied to the exposed resist <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. For example, different depths may generate different signatures that indicate one or more exposure results and which can thus be employed to generate feedback/feedforward information that can be employed to control post exposure steps and which can thus facilitate achieving desired critical dimensions. For example, a first average depth and/or maximum and minimum depth may indicate that a first development temperature should be applied for a first development time and that a first post exposure bake temperature should be applied for a first post exposure bake time while a second average depth and/or maximum and minimum depth may indicate that a second development temperature should be applied for a second development time and that a second post exposure bake temperature should be applied for a second post exposure bake time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> By way of further illustration, the exposed resist <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may also have a third feature <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and a fourth feature <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> whose sides are sloped. Scatterometry techniques can be employed to determine what, if anything, the slopes indicate concerning exposure. Similarly, scatterometry techniques can be employed to determine, based on the slopes of the sides of the features <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, for example, development times and/or temperatures and/or post exposure bake times and/or temperatures to be applied to the exposed resist <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. For example, different slopes may generate different signatures that indicate one or more exposure results and which can thus be employed to generate feedback/feedforward information that can be employed to control post exposure processes and which can thus facilitate achieving desired critical dimensions. For example, a first average slope and/or maximum and minimum slope may indicate that a first development temperature should be applied for a first development time and that a first post exposure bake temperature should be applied for a first post exposure bake time while a second average slope and/or maximum and minimum slope may indicate that a second development temperature should be applied for a second development time and that a second post exposure bake temperature should be applied for a second post exposure bake time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> By way of further illustration, the chemical composition of the exposed resist <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may also generate one or more signatures. Scatterometry techniques can be employed to determine what, if anything, the chemical composition indicates concerning exposure. Similarly, scatterometry techniques can be employed to determine, based on the chemical composition, development times and/or temperatures and/or post exposure bake times and/or temperatures to be applied to the exposed resist <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. For example, different chemical compositions may generate different signatures that indicate one or more exposure results and which can thus be employed to generate feedback/feedforward information that can be employed to control post exposure processes and which can thus facilitate achieving desired critical dimensions. For example, a first chemical composition may indicate that a first development temperature should be applied for a first development time and that a first post exposure bake temperature should be applied for a first post exposure bake time while a second chemical composition may indicate that a second development temperature should be applied for a second development time and that a second post exposure bake temperature should be applied for a second post exposure bake time. </paragraph>

The wafer may include one or more features <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, whose critical dimensions can be affected by exposure time and/or post exposure baking, for example. By way of illustration, a first measurement for the length <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of the feature <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may indicate that a first post exposure bake time should be employed in post exposure processes while a second measurement for the length <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of the feature <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may indicate that a second post exposure bake time should be employed in post exposure processes. Similarly, a first measurement for the width <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> of the feature <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may indicate that a first post exposure bake time should be employed in post exposure processes while a second measurement for the width <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> of the feature <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> may indicate that a second post exposure bake time should be employed in post exposure processes. The critical dimension measurements (e.g., length <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, width <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight>) taken from the latent image may be correlated to facilitate producing feedback/feedforward information that can be employed to control post exposure processes. For example, the area of the feature <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, as determined by multiplying the length <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> by the width <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> may be employed in generating feedback/feedforward information that can be employed to control a post exposure development process. </paragraph>

The system <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> includes an exposing system <highlight><bold>530</bold></highlight> that is employed to expose a pattern on a photo-resist. Exposing the pattern produces a latent image on the wafer <highlight><bold>540</bold></highlight>, with features with measurable critical dimensions. The critical dimensions can be measured through scatterometry means and fed into a critical dimension monitor <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight>. The critical dimension monitor <highlight><bold>550</bold></highlight> can then be employed to generate feed forward information that is employed in controlling a developing system <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight> and/or a post exposure baking system <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> system <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> for monitoring exposure results of a pattern developed on a wafer <highlight><bold>665</bold></highlight> is shown. One or more latent images of a pattern have been exposed into the wafer <highlight><bold>665</bold></highlight>. The latent image may include a grating <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>. The grating <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> is formed on the wafer <highlight><bold>665</bold></highlight>, as part of the latent image exposed into the photo resist <highlight><bold>675</bold></highlight>, to facilitate analyzing critical dimensions in features in the latent image pattern exposed on the wafer <highlight><bold>665</bold></highlight>. The system <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> further includes an exposing system <highlight><bold>655</bold></highlight> that is selectively controlled by the system <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> to facilitate controlling exposure of the pattern into the photo resist <highlight><bold>675</bold></highlight>. The wafer <highlight><bold>665</bold></highlight> is supported on a chuck <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>. Although one grating <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> is illustrated, it is to be appreciated that a greater number of gratings may be employed by the present invention. The gratings can be equal lines and/or spaces, and/or varying lines an/or spaces. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, linewidth ranges from 1 &mgr;m to 50 nm. Preferrably, grating area is within a range of 100 &mgr;m&times;100 &mgr;m to 10 &mgr;m&times;10 &mgr;m so that a spot size of a light beam in accordance with the invention is smaller than the grating size. It is to be appreciated that the grating area and beam spot size can be suitably tailored and thus the subject invention should not be limited to any ranges noted herein as preferable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> One or more light sources <highlight><bold>635</bold></highlight> projects light onto respective portions of the wafer <highlight><bold>665</bold></highlight>. The wafer <highlight><bold>665</bold></highlight> can be partitioned into one or more portions. The latent image exposed into the photo resist <highlight><bold>675</bold></highlight> can be located in one or more of the portions. Each portion of the wafer <highlight><bold>665</bold></highlight> can also have zero or more gratings <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> formed thereon. Light reflected, and/or passed through, the latent image and/or the gratings <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> is collected by one or more light detecting components <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>, and processed by a signature system <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> to produce a signature that measures at least one parameter relating to the exposure of the latent image and/or gratings <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>. By way of illustration, a signature associated with the latent image and/or one or more gratings <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> may indicate that the exposing system <highlight><bold>635</bold></highlight> should terminate exposure of the pattern that is forming the latent image in the photo resist <highlight><bold>675</bold></highlight>. The reflected and/or passed through light is processed with respect to the incident light in measuring the various parameters. The reflected and/or passed through or transmitted light can generate one or more signatures associated with the latent image and/or the one or more gratings <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>. The signatures can be employed to generate feedback control information that can be employed to control the exposure via the exposure driving system. The signatures can also be employed to generate feed forward information that can be employed by a developing system <highlight><bold>645</bold></highlight> and/or a baking system <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight>. By way of illustration, the signatures may indicate that the a first exposure result was produced by the exposing system <highlight><bold>655</bold></highlight> and thus a first development time and a first post exposure bake time should be employed to facilitate achieving desired critical dimensions in response to the first exposure result. By way of further illustration, the signatures may indicate that the a second exposure result was produced by the exposing system <highlight><bold>655</bold></highlight> and thus a second development time and a second post exposure bake time should be employed to facilitate achieving desired critical dimensions in response to the second exposure result. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> A source of light <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> (e.g., a laser) provides light to the one or more light sources <highlight><bold>635</bold></highlight> via the signature system <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the light source <highlight><bold>625</bold></highlight> is a frequency stabilized laser, however, it will be appreciated that any laser or other light source (e.g., laser diode or helium neon (HeNe) gas laser) suitable for carrying out the present invention may be employed. One or more light detecting components <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> (e.g., photo detector, photo diodes) collect light reflecting from or passing through the latent image in the photo resist <highlight><bold>675</bold></highlight> and/or the one or more gratings <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> A processor <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> receives the measured data from the signature system <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> and determines whether to terminate exposure of the pattern that is forming the latent image in the photo resist <highlight><bold>675</bold></highlight> by the exposing system <highlight><bold>655</bold></highlight> based, at least in part, on comparing signatures measured from the latent image and/or the one or more gratings <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> formed in the photo resist <highlight><bold>675</bold></highlight> to desired signatures. The processor <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> is operatively coupled to the signature system <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> and is programmed to control and operate the various components within the system <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> in order to carry out the various functions described herein. The processor, or CPU <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, may be any of a plurality of processors, such as the AMD ATHLON and other similar and compatible processors. The manner in which the processor <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> can be programmed to carry out the functions relating to the present invention will be readily apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art based on the description provided herein. A memory <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight>, which is operatively coupled to the processor <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight>, is also included in the system <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> and can store program code executed by the processor <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> for carrying out operating functions of the system <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> as described herein. The memory <highlight><bold>615</bold></highlight> also serves as a storage medium for temporarily storing information such as latent image signatures, grating signatures, exposure time, latent image signature tables, grating signature tables, component coordinate tables, latent image feature sizes, grating sizes, latent image feature shapes, grating shapes, scatterometry information, and other data that may be employed in carrying out the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> A power supply <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> provides operating power to the system <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. Any suitable power supply <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> (e.g., battery, line power) can be employed to carry out the present invention. The processor <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> is also coupled to a developing/baking driving system <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> that drives a developing system <highlight><bold>645</bold></highlight> and/or a baking system <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight>. The developing/baking driving system <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight> is controlled by the processor <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> to selectively cause the developing system <highlight><bold>645</bold></highlight> and/or the baking system <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> to change one or more properties including, but not limited to, development time, development temperature, post exposure bake time and post exposure bake temperature. In an alternative aspect of the present invention, the processor <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> monitors the signatures associated with the latent image exposed in the photo resist <highlight><bold>675</bold></highlight> and the one or more gratings <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> and selectively controls the exposing system <highlight><bold>655</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the processor <highlight><bold>605</bold></highlight> monitors the signatures associated with the latent image exposed in the photo resist <highlight><bold>675</bold></highlight> and the one or more gratings <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight> and generates feed forward information that can be employed to control the developing system <highlight><bold>645</bold></highlight> and/or the baking system <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight>. As a result, the system <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> provides for regulating how a wafer with a latent image exposed in the photo resist <highlight><bold>675</bold></highlight> will be developed and how a wafer with a latent image exposed in the photo resist <highlight><bold>675</bold></highlight> will be baked, which in turn improves fidelity of image transfer in a lithographic process. Improved image transfer fidelity facilitates achieving desired critical dimensions and thus smaller feature sizes and higher packing densities. Achieving substantially similar desired critical dimensions for different patterns on different layers improves IC quality, and facilitates higher speeds for such chips. </paragraph>

A light source <highlight><bold>730</bold></highlight> provides a light to one or more light emitters <highlight><bold>740</bold></highlight> that direct a light <highlight><bold>760</bold></highlight> incident to the surface of the photo resist <highlight><bold>790</bold></highlight>. The reflected light <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> from the surface of the photo resist <highlight><bold>790</bold></highlight> will vary (e.g., variations in intensity and/or phase) in accordance with the critical dimensions achieved and/or chemical composition for the latent image and/or the grating <highlight><bold>780</bold></highlight>. One or more light detecting components <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> collect the reflected light <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight>, pass the collected light, and/or data concerning the collected light, to a signature system <highlight><bold>720</bold></highlight>, which processes the reflected light <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> and/or data concerning the reflected light <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> in accordance with suitable techniques (e.g., scatterometry, spectroscopic ellipsometry) to provide a processor <highlight><bold>710</bold></highlight> with grating signature data. The reflected light <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> can be analyzed to generate one or more signatures that can be compared to one or more stored signatures to determine whether, for example, the latent image and/or the grating <highlight><bold>780</bold></highlight> has achieved desired critical dimensions and thus, whether exposure should be concluded. Similarly, the reflected light <highlight><bold>770</bold></highlight> can be analyzed to generate one or more signatures that can be compared to one or more stored signatures to generate, for example, feed forward information that can be employed to control post exposure processes including, but not limited to, a development process and a post exposure bake process. </paragraph>

The wafer <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight> may be divided into a grid pattern as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference>. Each grid block (XY) of the grid pattern corresponds to a particular portion of the wafer <highlight><bold>910</bold></highlight>, and each grid block has a portion of the latent image (including zero or more gratings (e.g., <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>)) associated with that grid block. Each portion is monitored individually for signatures generated by the latent image and or the one or more gratings (e.g., <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). </paragraph>

Given the set of recorded signatures, a processor may determine that an undesirable exposure condition exists. Similarly, a processor may generate feed forward information to provide to post exposure processes including, but not limited to, developing processes and baking processes. Accordingly, the processor may control systems including, but not limited to, an exposing system, a development system and a baking system. It is to be appreciated that the exposing system may be driven so as to maintain, terminate, and/or adjust exposure. It is to be further appreciated that the development system may be driven so as to establish, maintain, and/or adjust development properties including, but not limited to, time, temperature and atmosphere. It is to be further appreciated that the baking system may be driven so as to establish, maintain, and/or adjust baking properties including, but not limited to, time and temperature. </paragraph>

A sample, such as a wafer <highlight><bold>1204</bold></highlight> is placed in the path of the beam <highlight><bold>1202</bold></highlight> and a photo detector or photo multiplier <highlight><bold>1206</bold></highlight> of any suitable well-known construction.

While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of function blocks, it is to be understood and appreciated that the present invention is not limited by the order of the blocks, as some blocks may, in accordance with the present invention, occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other blocks from that shown and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the present invention. It is to be appreciated that the various blocks may be implemented via software, hardware a combination thereof or any suitable means (e.g., device, system, process, component) for carrying out the functionality associated with the blocks. It is also to be appreciated that the blocks are merely to illustrate certain aspects of the present invention in a simplified form and that these aspects may be illustrated via a lesser and/or greater number of blocks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating a methodology <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> for carrying out aspects of the present invention. At <highlight><bold>1400</bold></highlight> general initializations occur. Such initializations can include, but are not limited to, acquiring memory, acquiring resources, establishing data communications, establishing variables and instantiating one or more objects. At <highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight>, a pattern is exposed onto a photo resist. Exposing the pattern onto the photo resist will cause a latent image to begin to form on the photo resist. At <highlight><bold>1430</bold></highlight>, scatterometry techniques are employed to analyze the emerging latent image. At <highlight><bold>1440</bold></highlight>, a determination is made concerning whether exposure of the pattern has completed. For example, properties including, but not limited to the depth, width, slope and chemical composition of features in the latent image can be analyzed. If the determination at <highlight><bold>1440</bold></highlight> is NO, then at <highlight><bold>1450</bold></highlight> an estimated remaining exposure time can be calculated, and the process can continue at <highlight><bold>1420</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> If the determination at <highlight><bold>1440</bold></highlight> is YES, that exposure is complete then at <highlight><bold>1460</bold></highlight> properties associated with a post exposure development process can be calculated. For example, properties including, but not limited to, development time, development temperature and development atmosphere composition can be determined. Information concerning such properties can be fed forward to a subsequent development process, thus facilitating achieving desired critical dimensions with resulting improvements in chip quality.

<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> At <highlight><bold>1470</bold></highlight>, properties associated with a post exposure baking process can be calculated. For example, properties including, but not limited to, baking time, baking temperature and baking atmosphere composition can be determined. Information concerning such properties can be fed forward to a subsequent baking process, thus facilitating achieving desired critical dimensions with resulting improvements in chip quality. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> is a flow diagram illustrating a methodology <highlight><bold>1500</bold></highlight> for carrying out aspects of the present invention. At <highlight><bold>1505</bold></highlight>, general initializations are performed. Such initializations can include, but are not limited to, acquiring memory, acquiring resources, establishing data communications, establishing variables and instantiating one or more objects. At <highlight><bold>1510</bold></highlight>, a grid map comprising a plurality of grid blocks &ldquo;XY&rdquo; is generated. At <highlight><bold>1515</bold></highlight>, one or more gratings are exposed and begin forming part of a latent image on a photo resist. Zero or more gratings may be exposed in each of the grid blocks &ldquo;XY&rdquo;. At <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight>, scatterometry techniques are employed to measure properties of the gratings of <highlight><bold>1515</bold></highlight>. Properties including, but not limited to, height, width, depth and chemical composition can be measured. The scatterometry techniques of <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight> can include, but are not limited to, analyzing grating signatures. At <highlight><bold>1525</bold></highlight>, a determination is made concerning whether all grid blocks have been measured. If the determination at <highlight><bold>1525</bold></highlight> is NO, then processing returns to <highlight><bold>1520</bold></highlight>. If the determination at step <highlight><bold>1525</bold></highlight> is YES, then at <highlight><bold>1530</bold></highlight>, one or more signatures are produced and compared to acceptable signatures to determine results generated by the exposure of <highlight><bold>1515</bold></highlight>. At <highlight><bold>1535</bold></highlight>, a determination is made concerning whether an unexpected signature has been encountered. If the determination at <highlight><bold>1535</bold></highlight> is NO, then at <highlight><bold>1540</bold></highlight> regular techniques can be employed to determine post exposure developer properties and at <highlight><bold>1545</bold></highlight> regular techniques can be employed to determine post exposure bake properties. By way of illustration, if the latent image has dimensions and/or properties within expected ranges and/or tolerances, as indicated by one or more signatures read from the one or more gratings, then a simple table lookup value, or &ldquo;proceed as normal&rdquo; signal can be fed forward to post exposure developing and/or baking processes. But if the determination at <highlight><bold>1535</bold></highlight> is YES, that an unexpected signature was encountered, then at <highlight><bold>1550</bold></highlight>, techniques for computing post exposure developer properties when the latent image has dimensions and/or properties outside expected ranges and/or tolerances, as indicated by one or more signatures read from one or more gratings, can be employed. For example, data generated by sophisticated modeling techniques can be fed forward to a post exposure development process to facilitate achieving desired critical dimensions even though exposure generated unexpected properties and/or dimensions. Similarly, at <highlight><bold>1555</bold></highlight>, techniques for computing post exposure baking properties when the latent image has dimensions and/or properties outside expected ranges and/or tolerances, as indicated by one or more signatures read from one or more gratings, can be employed. For example, data generated by sophisticated neural network processing techniques can be fed forward to a post exposure baking process to facilitate achieving desired critical dimensions even though exposure generated unexpected properties and/or dimensions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> Scatterometry is a technique for extracting information about a surface upon which an incident light has been directed. Information concerning properties including, but not limited to, dishing, erosion, profile, chemical composition, thickness of thin films and critical dimensions of features present on a surface such as a wafer can be extracted. The information can be extracted by comparing the phase and/or intensity of the light directed onto the surface with phase and/or intensity signals of a complex reflected and/or diffracted light resulting from the incident light reflecting from and/or diffracting through the surface upon which the incident light was directed. The intensity and/or the phase of the reflected and/or diffracted light will change based on properties of the surface upon which the light is directed. Such properties include, but are not limited to, the chemical properties of the surface, the planarity of the surface, features on the surface, voids in the surface, and the number and/or type of layers beneath the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> Different combinations of the above-mentioned properties will have different effects on the phase and/or intensity of the incident light resulting in substantially unique intensity/phase signatures in the complex reflected and/or diffracted light. Thus, by examining a signal (signature) library of intensity/phase signatures, a determination can be made concerning the properties of the surface. Such substantially unique phase/intensity signatures are produced by light reflected from and/or refracted by different surfaces due, at least in part, to the complex index of refraction of the surface onto which the light is directed. The complex index of refraction (N) can be computed by examining the index of refraction (n) of the surface and an extinction coefficient (k). One such computation of the complex index of refraction can be described by the equation: </paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula><highlight><italic>N&equals;n&minus;jk </italic></highlight></in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> where j is an imaginary number. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> The signal (signature) library can be constructed from observed intensity/phase signatures and/or signatures generated by modeling and simulation. By way of illustration, when exposed to a first incident light of known intensity, wavelength and phase, a first feature on a wafer can generate a first phase/intensity signature. Similarly, when exposed to the first incident light of known intensity, wavelength and phase, a second feature on a wafer can generate a second phase/intensity signature. For example, a line of a first width may generate a first signature while a line of a second width may generate a second signature. Observed signatures can be combined with simulated and modeled signatures to form the signal (signature) library. Simulation and modeling can be employed to produce signatures against which measured phase/intensity signatures can be matched. In one exemplary aspect of the present invention, simulation, modeling and observed signatures are stored in a signal (signature) library containing over three hundred thousand phase/intensity signatures. Thus, when the phase/intensity signals are received from scatterometry detecting components, the phase/intensity signals can be pattern matched, for example, to the library of signals to determine whether the signals correspond to a stored signature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> To illustrate the principles described above, reference is now made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 through 19</cross-reference>. Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, an incident light <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight> is directed at a surface <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>, upon which one or more features <highlight><bold>1606</bold></highlight> may exist. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> the incident light <highlight><bold>1602</bold></highlight> is reflected as reflected light <highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight>. The properties of the surface <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>, including but not limited to, thickness, uniformity, planarity, chemical composition and the presence of features, can affect the reflected light <highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, the features <highlight><bold>1606</bold></highlight> are raised upon the surface <highlight><bold>1600</bold></highlight>. The phase and intensity of the reflected light <highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight> can be measured and plotted, as shown, for example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>. The phase <highlight><bold>2100</bold></highlight> of the reflected light <highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight> can be plotted, as can the intensity <highlight><bold>2110</bold></highlight> of the reflected light <highlight><bold>1604</bold></highlight>. Such plots can be employed to compare measured signals with signatures stored in a signature library using techniques like pattern matching, for example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference>, an incident light <highlight><bold>1712</bold></highlight> is directed onto a surface <highlight><bold>1710</bold></highlight> upon which one or more depressions <highlight><bold>1716</bold></highlight> appear. The incident light <highlight><bold>1712</bold></highlight> is reflected as reflected light <highlight><bold>1514</bold></highlight>. Like the one or more features <highlight><bold>1606</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>) may affect an incident beam, so too may the one or more depressions <highlight><bold>1716</bold></highlight> affect an incident beam. Thus, it is to be appreciated that scatterometry can be employed to measure features appearing on a surface, features appearing in a surface, and properties of a surface itself, regardless of features. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, complex reflections and refractions of an incident light <highlight><bold>1840</bold></highlight> are illustrated. The reflection and refraction of the incident light <highlight><bold>1840</bold></highlight> can be affected by factors including, but not limited to, the presence of one or more features <highlight><bold>1828</bold></highlight>, and the composition of the substrate <highlight><bold>1820</bold></highlight> upon which the features <highlight><bold>1828</bold></highlight> reside. For example, properties of the substrate <highlight><bold>1820</bold></highlight> including, but not limited to the thickness of a layer <highlight><bold>1822</bold></highlight>, the chemical composition of the layer <highlight><bold>1822</bold></highlight>, the opacity and/or reflectivity of the layer <highlight><bold>1822</bold></highlight>, the thickness of a layer <highlight><bold>1824</bold></highlight>, the chemical composition of the layer <highlight><bold>1824</bold></highlight>, the opacity and/or reflectivity of the layer <highlight><bold>1824</bold></highlight>, the thickness of a layer <highlight><bold>1826</bold></highlight>, the chemical composition of the layer <highlight><bold>1826</bold></highlight>, and the opacity and/or reflectivity of the layer <highlight><bold>1826</bold></highlight> can affect the reflection and/or refraction of the incident light <highlight><bold>1840</bold></highlight>. Thus, a complex reflected and/or refracted light <highlight><bold>1842</bold></highlight> may result from the incident light <highlight><bold>1840</bold></highlight> interacting with the features <highlight><bold>1828</bold></highlight>, and/or the layers <highlight><bold>1822</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1824</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1826</bold></highlight>. Although three layers <highlight><bold>1822</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1824</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1826</bold></highlight> are illustrated, it is to be appreciated that a substrate can be formed of a greater or lesser number of such layers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, one of the properties from <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> is illustrated in greater detail. The substrate <highlight><bold>1920</bold></highlight> can be formed of one or more layers <highlight><bold>1922</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1924</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>1926</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The phase <highlight><bold>1950</bold></highlight> of the reflected and/or refracted light <highlight><bold>1942</bold></highlight> can depend, at least in part, on the thickness of a layer, for example, the layer <highlight><bold>1924</bold></highlight>. Thus, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference>, the phase <highlight><bold>2052</bold></highlight> of a reflected light <highlight><bold>2042</bold></highlight> differs from the phase <highlight><bold>1950</bold></highlight> due, at least in part, to the different thickness of the layer <highlight><bold>2024</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</cross-reference> from the thickness of the layer <highlight><bold>1924</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> Thus, scatterometry is a technique that can be employed to extract information about a surface upon which an incident light has been directed. The information can be extracted by analyzing phase and/or intensity signals of a complex reflected and/or diffracted light. The intensity and/or the phase of the reflected and/or diffracted light will change based on properties of the surface upon which the light is directed, resulting in substantially unique signatures that can be analyzed to determine one or more properties of the surface upon which the incident light was directed. </paragraph>
