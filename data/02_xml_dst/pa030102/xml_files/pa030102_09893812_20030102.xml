<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A plug which has a plugging portion and a stem extending therefrom is formed of an elastomeric material in order to deform to create a wiping engagement and a seal with the walls of a receiving cavity. The stem and plugging portion include both cavities for receiving alignment pins in the device being plugged and a manually engageable portion on a distal end of the stem for removing the plug from the sealed cavity, such as within an optical subassembly module.. The side edges of the plugging member conform to the cavity cross-section to enhance the sealing yet do not unduly deform the member. The sealing member is formed with one or more standoffs to engage an end face of the cavity, assuring no contact between the optical elements and the plug. The edges of the plug deform upon insertion to create the seal and form a wiping engagement with the cavity interior. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to protecting optical surfaces within an optical modules and more specifically, to plugging access channels extending into an electro-optical module or device during manufacturing process steps, thereby preventing contamination of or damage to optical surfaces and optical elements during the manufacturing processes. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> During an assembly manufacturing process of opto-electronic units or optical devices such as optical fibers, transmit optical sub-assemblies (TOSA&apos;s) and/or receive optical subassemblies (ROSA&apos;s), various operations, such as soldering, are required. These operations may include but are not limited to a sequence of one or more solder flux applications, solder paste depositions, solder reflow and washing to remove any previously deposited flux, or any remaining residue of the flux and solder paste. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The soldering steps are generally accomplished by reflow whereby solder paste or another form of solder is deposited at the site where soldering is to occur; next, the entire assembled unit or at least a portion thereof is heated to a temperature at which the solder is rendered molten and caused to reflow between various juxtaposed electrical contacts which are positioned in contact with the solder or solder paste. This solder reflow operation is conventional and well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, the solder paste and the flux coact to permit all the solder pads or contacts in the assembly or subassembly not only to be soldered simultaneously but also with a high degree of quality control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> After solder reflow, upon cooling, a portion of the flux previously deposited in significant quantities may remain and must be removed and cleaned. Typically, this flux removal is accomplished by washing with a water bath. Flux composition is selected to be water soluble to enhance the removal of unconsumed flux from regions near soldered electrical joints. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The optical elements contained within the TOSA (transmit optical subassembly) and ROSA (receive optical subassembly), optical fibers and any exposed optical surfaces may be formed of light transmissive materials which are selected not only to optically function as desired but also to withstand the high temperatures encountered in solder reflow. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Optical fibers are normally glass, while other optical elements may be fabricated of clear high temperature plastics. However, heat may slightly affect the unprotected surfaces of the optical elements. Although not directly heat related, some damage to or degradation of the optical elements such as fiber optic ends, may be caused by contact between optical elements and molten solder, flux, flux residue or vapors resulting from the solder reflow operation.. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Additionally, the optical surfaces of the devices or lens surfaces similarly may be contaminated, coated with water, or small quantities of water borne flux which may be deposited on the optical surfaces of the optical fibers. This contamination of the surfaces, a result of the wash operation, may alter or degrade the transmission of optical signals through such optical surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Other sources of contaminants such as dust or other foreign particles also may accumulate on the optical surfaces and adversely affect the transmission of signals through the optical fibers or other optical surfaces of the optical components during other manufacturing steps or subsequent handling, packaging, shipping or further assembly into larger units or subassemblies. With the optical elements recessed within an optical assembly, the cleaning and/or removal of the contaminants on optical elements and especially the exposed optical surfaces thereof is difficult if not impractical. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> It is an object of the invention to protect the optical elements of an optical subassembly at least during the manufacture and assembly of the optical subassembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to seal the access channel to optical surfaces within an optical subassembly during the manufacturing steps of assembly of the optical subassemblies. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the invention to prevent invasion of water or other contaminants into the region of the optical elements of an optical subassembly during wash operations of the assembly process. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the invention to prevent heat related deformation of the optical subassembly connector by the presence of the invention during solder reflow operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is a still further object of the invention to maintain a continuous seal with the optical subassembly connector housing during all periods for which the invention is resident within the optical subassembly connector housing. </paragraph>

</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> A channel within the optical subassembly, module housing or connector with optical elements therein. is plugged and sealed in order to seal access to and protect optical components, and particularly the optical surfaces of optical components of an optical subassembly during the manufacturing process steps of assembly of the optical subassembly, and especially the solder reflow and wash steps of such a process. The portions requiring isolation and protection are the exposed optical surfaces of the optical elements. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The channel plug, a fluoro-elastomeric material, is typically by manufactured molding. The fluoro-elastomer is chosen to be capable of withstanding temperatures up to about 260&deg; C., the upper limit of a common solder reflow temperature range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The plug is formed with a plugging and sealing end which is relatively thin but which is sufficiently thick to provide sufficient stability to form a wiping engagement with the walls of a channel within the optical subassembly. The plugging end is molded to form a periphery conforming in shape to the interior of an optical subassembly channel and dimensioned to be slightly larger than the interior of an optical subassembly channel. The peripheral shape of a plug end is substantially the same as but slightly larger than the interior dimensions of sidewalls of the channel to be plugged. Edges of a plugging portion engage the side walls and may be formed either as arcuate edges wherein interior side walls of the channel are similarly arcuate. The top and bottom wall engaging edges may be substantially straight or curved as required to conform to the edges of a cross-section of the channel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Due to the slightly oversize relationship of the plug end portion to the interior of the channel, the plug deforms, compresses, and/or deflects due to its elastomeric nature, whenever inserted into the channel. The deflection of the edge margins of the plug creates not only a wiping contact and a forceful seal between the edge margins but also an inherent retention force which seals and retains the plug in place until removed by forcible withdrawal. The edge margins similarly will deform or deflect under the withdrawal force being exerted on the plugging end. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In an attempt to restore to its undeformed and undeflected state, the plugging portion exerts a small but sufficient force on the interior of the channel walls to effect a water-tight and debris-tight seal between the plugging portion and the channel walls. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> A stem is joined to and extends from one surface of the plug member. The stem terminates in an enlarged flattened bulbous portion configured to be easily and reliably grasped by a thumb and finger in order to pull and remove the plug from the channel of an optical subassembly. The junction between a stem and the sealing plug portion is enlarged in cross-section so that only a narrow peripheral zone or margin of the sealing plug is unsupported by a stem, thereby concentrating deflection of the elastomeric plug member in the periphery or edge margins of the plug portion. This concentration of deflection increases the sealing forces relative to members without similar support. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The opposing face of the plug portion may be provided with protrusions or standoff members to insure that the surface of the plug portion is prevented from contacting the ends of the optical fibers or other optical surfaces within the connector. The standoffs are spaced from each other to provide a space adjacent the ends of the optical fibers or surfaces of the optical components whenever the plug is installed as intended. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> This Summary of the Invention is provided to give one of skill in the art a synopsis of the main aspects of the invention and is not intended for limiting nor should it be used to limit the scope of the invention in any manner. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In order to fully understand the invention, it is recommended that initial reference be made to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> of the drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The process protective plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is illustrated in an isometric view. The plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the protective plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is disposed and formed on an end of a stem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and is substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal axis <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the stem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The stem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed at its opposite end into a enlarged portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The enlarged surfaces <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> form thumb/finger gripping regions on the outboard end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the stem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Stem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is formed with a longitudinal dimension sufficient that the plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may seat in the bottom or end of a channel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> leaving the grip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extending from the optical subassembly connector channel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as will be described in more detail below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference>, stem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be provided with a key <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and the receiving channel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may have a mating keyway <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or other subchannel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to accommodate the key <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> insertable into keyway <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. Key <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may be formed on one of the surfaces of stem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and extend there along. Key <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> creates additional stiffness in stem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and further supports a tab <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> extending from the plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in an essentially coplanar relationship with the plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The support supplied to the tab <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> prevents excessive deformation of the tab <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and insures that the tab <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> will adequately engage the walls of the keyway <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or subchannel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and particularly the walls of the keyway <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> within which it is resident. By maintaining the engagement of the tab <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with the walls of keyway <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the seal formed by the plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and particularly tab <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> with the walls of keyway <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> or walls of subchannel <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is assured. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Passages <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are formed on and into opposing sides of the stem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and extend through plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. These passage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> receive alignment pins <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> disposed within and extending into the channel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the optical subassembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Passages <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are sized to surround the alignment pins <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and leave only a very small gap <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> intermediate the passages <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and alignment pins <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. The gap <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is small enough that the surface tension of the wash water will prevent any water from passing through the gaps <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, at the point of attachment or joining with the plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, stem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> progressively widens to form a filet <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. This widening of the stem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> distributes the extraction forces exerted on stem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> pulling on the plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and thereby reduces the prospect of failure of the elastomeric material in that region during removal of plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> An additional benefit of the filets <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is that support of the plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is extended from the nominal footprint of the stem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> toward the edges <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby reducing the width of the edge margins <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. By reducing the width of the edge margins <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the rigidity of the plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> near its edges, particularly the arcuate edges <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> located most distant from the stem <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, is increased while retaining a controlled deformability that is necessary for a wiping edge engagement and seal with the channel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference> is now appropriate. On the exposed face <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, are disposed a pair of standoffs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. The standoffs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are protruding members or projections extending from the plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Upon insertion of the plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and seating of the plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> into a receiving channel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, the standoffs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> engage the end face <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of channel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The standoffs <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are positioned to that they will engage the end face <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> on either side of optical fiber ends or other optical surfaces. exposed through end face <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> contact with the optical fibers (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably configured with the side edges <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> formed in an arcuate shape, but may be any shape desired to engage the side walls <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of channel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This arcuate shape permits the plugging member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to conform to the curved side walls <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of channel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This arcuate edge shape is advantageous in that the deflection of the side edges <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will be generally uniform and consistent about the periphery of plugging portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby creating a substantially uniform sealing engagement between plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the channel walls <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> At this point, refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. An optical subassembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is illustrated in section view with the plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> inserted into channel <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and fully seated against end face <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The elastomeric nature of the material from which the plug <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is fabricated is very advantageous in a further aspect.

The structure of the optical subassembly <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is typically molded from a plastic. The plastic is selected to withstand limited exposure to the solder reflow temperatures but may soften to some slight extent, among other attributes.
