<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to expandable screws, and more particularly, to an expandable screw apparatus and method for driving and expanding the same in a structure. In addition, the present invention relates to an assembly for the same. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Screw fixation is commonly used in spinal internal posterior fixation surgeries for various spinal disorders such as spondylolisthesis, trauma, tumors, deformities and other conditions. Many screw fixation systems have been developed and are used increasingly to connect different designs of such screws to structural members such as plates, rods, bars, and the like. In these systems, pedicle screws are often employed, which are cancellous bone screws that can sustain high loads. The strength of the bone-screw interface is crucial, because the interface must be strong enough to withstand the correcting forces applied intraoperatively and stable enough to avoid deformation under physiologic loading after surgery. A poor bone-screw interface can decrease the strength and stability of the construct and cause pseudoarthrosis, loss of correction, and failure of surgeries due to screw loosening or pullout, for instance, in an osteoporotic patient. The bone-screw interface is affected by variables such as bone mineral density (BMD), screw design, insertion technique, and supplementary instruments. Particularly, the BMD has a critical influence on the bone-screw interface. However, host bone quality mostly is beyond a surgeon&apos;s control. Therefore, increasing the strength of the bone-screw interface by focusing on screw design and screw hole preparation continues to be an important aspect of study in screw fixation systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Various systems have been implemented for fixating screws into structures such as bone. For instance, simple pedicle screws that did not expand were driven into bone in the past. However, this type of screw did not optimize holding power and therefore the bone-screw interface strength lacked. In addition, supplemental devices have been used to augment the holding strength of fixation devices. For example, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) has been employed as an injection cement to increase holding power of fixated screws. However, PMMA may lose its fixative strength over time and can cause neurological injury by extrusion of the cement. Therefore, it has not been used routinely. Also, supplemental devices have included laminar hooks in combination with pedicle screws and/or a washer or staple combined with vertebral screws. Furthermore, other devices such as an anchor have been used in combination with transvertebral screws. However, uses of these supplemental instruments are not ideal as they can require the recruitment of additional bone structures and can significantly increase the complexity of the fixation procedure, or they are not practical for fixation into particular structures, such as bone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Still a more useful pedicle screw has been developed, wherein the screw is expandable at the driven end upon insertion into a bone structure or the like. However, as this screw is expanded after the formation of bone threads, the bone threads tend to compress thereby compromising the holding condition of the bone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there remains a need for a means of increasing the strength of the structure-screw interface. Also, there is yet a need for a less complicated and more convenient way of fixating screws to a surface and/or structure. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, the above and other problems were solved by providing an expandable screw apparatus and an expandable screw driving and expanding assembly, as well as a method for inserting and expanding an expandable screw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, an expandable screw apparatus includes an outer screw having a longitudinal hollow core and a plurality of longitudinal expandable slits proximate a distal end, and an inner screw, disposed inside the longitudinal hollow core of the outer screw, having a distal end extended outside the longitudinal hollow core of the outer screw. Further, the expandable screw apparatus includes an end nut, engaged with the distal end of the inner screw, wherein by rotating the outer screw relative to the inner screw while simultaneously holding the inner screw, the end nut is drawn into the hollow core of the outer screw, thereby causing simultaneous expansion of the expandable slits in a transversal direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Further in one embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for fixation of an expandable screw apparatus into a structure. First, an expandable screw apparatus is provided, which includes an outer screw having a longitudinal hollow core, an inner screw, and a end nut. The expandable screw apparatus is driven a length inwards without expanding the screw apparatus. Then the end nut connected to the inner screw can be engaged into one of a plurality of longitudinal slits at a distal end of the outer screw by rotating the inner screw to draw the end nut inwards. After the end nut is engaged, the expandable screw apparatus can continue being driven inwards by simultaneously holding the inner screw in place to prevent the inner screw from rotating, and rotating and driving the outer screw thereby moving the end nut proximally into the longitudinal hollow core of the outer screw towards the proximal end of the inner screw, the end nut includes a portion having a larger diameter than a diameter of the longitudinal hollow core. By simultaneously rotating the outer screw of the expandable screw apparatus and holding the inner screw of the expandable screw apparatus, which prevents the inner screw from rotating, the expandable screw is being driven into a structure, while simultaneously being expanded in an outwardly transversal direction from the longitudinal hollow core at its longitudinal slits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Yet in one embodiment in a method of fixating an expandable screw, the end nut can be pre-engaged into one of the longitudinal slits at the end of the outer screw, thereby eliminating the need for the step of engaging the end nut as described in the above embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Still in one embodiment, an assembly for driving and expanding an expandable screw apparatus, includes an outer screw, an inner screw, and an end nut as described in the above embodiment. In addition, the assembly contains a driver mechanism and an elongated stabilizing member. The driver mechanism contains a structural end connectable to a structural head of the outer screw, the driver mechanism also includes a hollow shaft. The elongated stabilizing member includes an end insertable first through the hollow shaft of the driver mechanism towards the proximal end of the outer screw and through the longitudinal hole region of the outer screw. The elongated stabilizing member is connectable to an insertion space of the proximal end cap of the inner screw. Furthermore, the elongated stabilizing member provides rotating means for the end nut to engage the longitudinal slits. Moreover, during dynamic expansion, the elongated stabilizing member provides holding means to prevent the inner screw from rotating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> One advantage of the present invention is that the employment of an expandable screw can increase the holding strength to the structure it is fixed to or therein. In addition, the method of the present invention allows an expandable screw to be inserted such that the strength of the structure-screw interface is improved, and also provides a less complicated way for inserting an expandable screw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> These and various other advantages and features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed hereto and form a part hereof. However, for a better understanding of the invention, its advantages, and the objects obtained by its use, reference should be made to the drawings which form a further part hereof, and to accompanying descriptive matter, in which there are illustrated and described specific examples of an apparatus in accordance with the invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> In the following description of the illustrated embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration of the embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized as structural changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an expandable screw apparatus for fixation into a structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>A-D, the expandable screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes a threaded outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a threaded inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and an end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The structure of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is such that a longitudinal hollow core <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> runs through the center axis of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the a proximal end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to a distal driving end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The longitudinal hollow core <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> has a tapered portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> at the distal end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as best depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The proximal end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is provided with a structural head <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> for attachment to a driver mechanism such as, but not limited to, a wrench. Further, the proximal end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> has a longitudinal hole region <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, which a stop region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is located therein. A diameter <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the longitudinal hole region <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is greater than a diameter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the longitudinal hollow core <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, thereby creating the stop region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> between the hole region <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the hollow core <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Also in the proximal end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, structural through holes <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> are provided in a transverse direction through and across the hollow region <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> as a means for supporting a structural frame such as, but not limited to, rods, plates, and bars. At the distal driving end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a plurality of longitudinal slits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are provided wherein the slits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> extend a length <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> from the distal end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> towards the proximal end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The longitudinal slits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are disposed apart at every certain degrees, e.g. 90&deg;. The longitudinal slits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> have an inner surface <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> that is substantially smooth. The outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a thread having either a right handed orientation or a left handed orientation on its outer surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The structure of the threaded inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a proximal end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a distal end <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The proximal end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> has a proximal end cap <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> wherein the proximal end cap <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> includes an insertion space <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> as best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>. A diameter <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the proximal end cap <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> is greater than a diameter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of a remaining portion of the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Typically, this remaining portion of the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is the threaded portion. In addition, the proximal end cap diameter <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is less than the diameter <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the longitudinal hole region <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> but greater than the diameter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the longitudinal hollow core <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the diameter <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> of the remaining portion of the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is less than the diameters <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of both the longitudinal hollow region <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and longitudinal hollow core <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, respectively. According to the above diameters, the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is insertable through the hollow region <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> and the longitudinal hollow core <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> from the proximal end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the distal end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. When the end cap <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> contacts the stop region <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is stopped and can no longer continue movement towards the distal end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The orientation of the thread of the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is opposite of the orientation of the thread of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Meaning, if the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a right handed thread on its outer surface, where the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is driven in clockwise, then the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> will have a left handed thread on its outer surface, where the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is driven in counterclockwise, or vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes a lip protrusion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> at a side of the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having an inner thread that is connectable to the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be rotated so as to draw the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> towards the proximal end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Also, the end nut <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> has a first end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and a second end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. The second end <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> has a diameter <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> greater than a diameter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the first end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. For instance, as illustrated best in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the end nut <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is a truncated cone shape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D and 3A</cross-reference>, B, the expandable screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown in its expanded state. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</cross-reference> (also in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>), prior to expansion of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is shown engaged into the longitudinal slits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D and 3A</cross-reference>, B, the diameter of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> along the longitudinal slit length <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> is illustrated as greater than the diameter of at least the remaining threaded portion of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, due to expansion of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. It is best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</cross-reference> where the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> has been drawn in towards the proximal end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The second diameter <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is greater than the diameter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the longitudinal hollow core <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, but the first diameter <highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> of the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is less than the diameter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the hollow core <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. This provides a structure for the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be moved into the hollow core <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> as it is drawn in with the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, thereby pushing on the walls of the longitudinal slits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> outwardly, which expands gaps <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> between the longitudinal slits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the tapered portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> engages with the outer surface of the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and the lip protrusion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is received in one of the gaps <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> between the longitudinal slits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The expandable screw apparatus can be made of an appropriate material such as, but not limited to, a metal alloy, stainless steel, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The present invention further provides a driving and expanding assembly <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> for the expandable screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> illustrate one embodiment of the assembly <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>. The assembly <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> includes the expandable screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> previously described above in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, a driver mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and an elongated stabilizing member <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The driver mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> includes a knob <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> for rotating and actuating the driver mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and a structural end <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> configured to receive the structural head <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>, a first inner stop <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> inside of the structural head <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> provides for limited insertion of the structural head <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Furthermore, the driver mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is provided with a hollow shaft <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> extending in a longitudinal direction along the central axis of the driver mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the elongated stabilizing member <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has an end <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, which is insertable first through the hollow shaft <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A, B</cross-reference> of the driver mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> at the proximal end <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and through the hole region <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>, and fit to the insertion space <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the proximal end cap <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</cross-reference>). Further, an elongated centering member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is provided that is insertable through the hollow shaft <highlight><bold>59</bold></highlight> of the driving mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to a second inner stop <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> disposed before the distal head <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> inside of the driving mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The centering member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> has a longitudinal through hole <highlight><bold>73</bold></highlight> along the longitudinal central axis allowing the elongated stabilizing member <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> to be positioned such that it connects and fits with the insertion space <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The centering member <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is cylindrical in shape. Moreover, the end <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> of the stabilizing member end <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, while being connected to the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, provides means for moving the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> inside the longitudinal slits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The stabilizing member <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is preferably a T-handle Allen Wrench as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As shown in its assembled form in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the assembly <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight> dynamically expands an expandable screw by simultaneously providing both driving and expanding motions for fixation of the screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to a structure (see later in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A, B</cross-reference> and C). Insertion of the expandable screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> into a structure a certain length can be achieved with the driver mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> by turning the knob <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> to actuate the driver mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. No expansion of the screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is occurring at this point. Simultaneous driving and expanding, i.e. the dynamic expansion, occurs when the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is engaged with one of the longitudinal slits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, where the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> engages with the tapered portion <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> of the distal end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, and the protrusion lip <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is retained in one of the gaps <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> between the longitudinal slits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Simultaneous driving and expanding is realized by continuous driving of the screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> into a structure, such as but not limited to bone, while holding the stabilizing member <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, which is engaged in the insertion space <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> of the end cap <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> of the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This simultaneous driving and expanding achieves a dynamic expansion of the screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> where the screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is being driven in and expanded at the same time. Holding the stabilizing member <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> and actuating the driver mechanism <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> allow the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to be drawn inwardly toward the proximal ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, respectively. Further, with the lip protrusion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> of the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> engaged with one of the gaps <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> between the longitudinal slits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, rotation of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, by the knob <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> and simultaneous holding of the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by the stabilizing member <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is drawn inwardly. This relative movement of the inner screw <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> allows the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to expand the screw apparatus <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> <highlight><bold>00</bold></highlight> as the second diameter <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is greater than the hollow core diameter <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. When the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is drawn inwardly a force pushes against the inner walls <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> of the outer screw <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> causing expansion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment of driving and expanding the expandable screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may not be engaged to one of the gaps <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> between the longitudinal slits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In this event, after insertion of the screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> a length into a structure, the stabilizing member <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> is rotated to draw the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> towards and into one of the gaps <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> of the longitudinal slits <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> so as to engage the end nut <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Thereafter, the expandable screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is dynamically expanded by incorporating similar procedural steps above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> In FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-C, the expandable screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is driven into a structure <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, such as a bone structure. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</cross-reference> illustrates that the expandable screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is in its non-expanded state. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</cross-reference> illustrates that the expandable screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is in its partially expanded state. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</cross-reference> illustrates that the expandable screw apparatus <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is in a final expanded state. Reference numerals referring to features of the expandable screw apparatus in FIGS. <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>A-C have been mentioned in detail in preceding FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and need no further description. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In addition to the above advantages of improved holding power and operation convenience, other advantages can be realized with respect to the present invention. Dynamic expansion of an expandable screw according to the present invention can allow for a safer and easier way in the fixation of screws into a structure. For instance, the simultaneous driving and expanding of an expandable screw places less pressure on a cutting surface between the screw and the structure, for example, in a bone surface, especially in the event the bone environment is hard. The existing methods use a static expansion technique, i.e. expanding a screw after the full insertion of the screw, which would apply high pressure on the cutting surface. Static expansion often causes damage to the screw and/or the structures. Dynamic expansion of the present invention allows the force to be distributed during the course of insertion. Also, the assembly of the present invention provides more controls for expansion allowing structural variability to be made not only to the inner and outer screws, but also to the end nut. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Having described the embodiments of the present invention, modifications and equivalents may occur to one skilled in the art. It is intended that such modifications and equivalents shall be included with the scope of the claims, which are appended hereto. </paragraph>
