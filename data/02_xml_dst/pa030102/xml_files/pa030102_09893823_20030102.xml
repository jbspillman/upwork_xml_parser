<section>
<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention generally relates to manufacturing technologies and, more particularly, generating labeling and other printed material for packages. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Each year, organizations ranging from sole proprietorships to large corporations produce and ship significant volumes of diverse products. The products, as well as the containers in which they are shipped, typically bear a variety of labels and other printed packaging materials. Each product may use a different container, requiring printed packaging material of different size and shape. In addition, a manufactured product may incorporate many packaging levels from the time the product comes off the manufacturing line to shipment. Furthermore, the format and content of the labels at each level may be highly regulated, as in the health care and pharmaceutical industries. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Large companies may use a number of different software tools to create and print the labels, such as graphics design and layout packages. Coordination of the various labels on a variety of packaging materials used throughout a company, and ensuring compliance with labeling regulations across all of the products, can be a significant challenge for an organization. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In general, the invention is directed to techniques for centrally managing the development of labeling data of an organization, such as a corporation, and for securely sharing the labeling data between business units and remote manufacturing sites, print centers or other output locations. In this manner, the techniques provide a central system for controlling the printed output material that the organization applies to packaging and manufactured products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a label management system in which a database stores a label record having a publication status, such as draft or approved. The database includes configuration data defining a plurality of output locations, such as manufacturing facilities, and a plurality of groups of an organization, such as business units. Furthermore, the database associates the label record with one of the groups of the organization. A label record manager presents an interface for maintaining the label record and setting the publication status of the label record. An output manager prints a label at one of a plurality of output locations based on the label record and the publication status. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the invention is directed to a label management system in which a database stores label records and associated label data. A label record manager controls the creation and modification of the label records and includes a revision control module to track changes made to the label records. The revision control module maintains modification logs for the label records and provides change histories for the label records. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, the invention is directed to a method including storing configuration data defining a plurality of organizations, each organization having at least one group and at least one output location. The method further includes presenting an interface by which each organization creates corresponding label records, and selectively printing labels at the corresponding output locations for the organizations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> These and other embodiments, including other systems, methods and computer-readable mediums that store instructions and data, are described in the specification and claims below. The invention provides many advantages, including allowing a corporation to develop a common management process across business units and manufacturing sites and, therefore, eliminate redundancies and inefficiencies inherent to a decentralized process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The corporation may, for example, readily develop and manage standardized graphics for the various business units, allowing the company to provide more consistency and accuracy in the appearance of labels entering distribution channels and customer markets. The centralized label management system provides a centralized workspace by which users can collaborate to design and create labels and other printed material for new packages, and can reduce cycle times by facilitating the reuse of existing label templates and graphics. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Furthermore, the centralized label management system allows a corporation to more easily control and manage the available labels, including the various sizes, layouts, and formats, as well as the output mediums on which the labels are printed. In particular, multiple output locations, such as manufacturing facilities and print centers, receive the same labeling data and, therefore, can print identical labels and other print material for packages and manufactured products. The system also provides an efficient mechanism for rapid propagation of labeling changes throughout an organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of a centralized labeling system is the ability to support relocation of products from one facility to another. In other words, because labeling data may be centrally managed, a company can relocate products from one manufacturing facility to another without needing to transfer labeling information. This process may be difficult with conventional desktop graphic design tools that execute on independent workstations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The centralized label management system provides revision control modules for developing and maintaining labeling data. The system, for example, includes mechanisms for checking in and checking out label templates and graphics. The system may track modifications of labels and provide revision histories and other modification information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Another advantage provided by the centralized label management system is to support and facilitate &ldquo;on-demand&rdquo; print systems by streamlining the delivery of label data to such systems when needed. In other words, label data can be quickly distributed to print systems when a company decides to manufacture a product, thereby allowing the company to satisfy any &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; manufacturing and supply contracts and other business relationships the company may service. In addition, the label management system supports &ldquo;run-time&rdquo; label fields that require information at the time of print, such as batch code, lot code, manufacture data, serial number and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a system <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for centrally managing labeling data for packaging and manufactured products generally. More specifically, authorized users of business units <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>N, collectively referred to as business units <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, for a corporation or other organization interact with label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via network <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to develop and manage the packaging labels or other printed material for manufactured products. Remote manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, print centers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or other output locations interact with label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via network <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to retrieve label data for company approved labels when packaging manufactured products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> allows business units <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and other remote users, such as graphic design firm <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, to define and approve labels including controlling all aspects and features of the printed label including size, layout, graphics, format, warning messages, and the like, as well as the output mediums and print devices on which the labels are printed. In this manner, label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> allows the corporation to better control the layout and appearance of labels being presented to market by manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. In particular, label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> ensures that manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and other output locations, such as print center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, receive the same labeling data and, therefore, print identical labels and other packaging material for manufactured products at different print locations. In addition, label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be used to control labels used during the manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can be used with any labeling device or system and can be used to print labels or other media, or can be used to print directly on packaging material such as folding cartons, boxes, flexible films or the like. Similarly, the label data, as defined herein, may be used for a variety of packaging purposes including, for example, to program radio frequency identification (RFID) tag fixed to products at the time of manufacturing. As examples, the RFID tag may be programmed with a lot code, a date of manufacture, a serial number, a UPC code or other label data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Any authorized user within business units <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, graphic design firm <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> or print service <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> can access label management system via network <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. A user can be any authorized individual, such as a packaging engineer within business unit <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A, a plant operator within manufacturing facility <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A, a graphic designer within graphic design firm <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, or a customer service representative within print center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and may be geographically distributed. By interacting with label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as described below, users <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can create, update, and archive label data, as well as generate labels for manufactured products. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A graphic designer within a business unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> or graphic design firm <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> can create custom graphics displaying, for example, corporate trademarks for use on labels. A packaging engineer may use label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to create label templates and define labeling strategies for various &ldquo;packaging levels&rdquo; of a product. As referred to herein, packaging levels describe the packaging process that a product undergoes from the time the product comes off the manufacturing line to shipment. Designating a label as packaging level <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> may, for example, indicate that the label is to be placed directly on the product itself. Designating the label as packaging level <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may indicate that the label is to be placed on a carton holding <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> individual products. Designating the label as packaging level <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may indicate that the label is to be placed on a case packed with 12 cartons. Finally, designating the template as packaging level <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> may indicate that the label is to be placed on a crate shipped with 200 cases. A plant operator within manufacturing facility <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A may interact with label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to retrieve label data and generate appropriate labels for a given product based on the packaging level. In addition, a service representative within print center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may carry out high-volume print runs of labels based on label data retrieved from label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Each user typically interacts with a computing device suitable for communication and interaction with label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via network <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. For example, a user may use a workstation, personal computer, laptop computer, or even a personal digital assistant (PDA) such as a Palm&trade; organizer from Palm Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif. or Windows CE device. The communication device executes communication software, typically a web browser such as Internet Explorer&trade; from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., in order to communicate with label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Network <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> represents any communication link suitable for communicating data, such as a wide-area network, local area network or a global computer network like the World Wide Web. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> By interacting with label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, business units <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> can develop a common label management process for manufacturing sites <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and, therefore, eliminate redundancies and inefficiencies inherent to a decentralized process. The business units <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> may, for example, develop and manage standardized graphics, allowing the company to provide more consistency and accuracy in the appearance of labeling entering distribution channels and customer markets. As described below, business units <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can control and manage labels used for packaging, including the various sizes, layouts, formats, as well as the output mediums on which the labels are printed. This allows the corporation to better control the labels being presented to market on shipped products. In particular, multiple output locations, such as manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and print center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and multiple output devices within a location, receive the same labeling data and, therefore, can print identical labels and other print material for packages and manufactured products. Accordingly, by providing access to a central label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, label changes can be propagated universally and instantly throughout an organization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> One advantage of label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is the ability to support relocation of products from one manufacturing facility <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to another. In other words, because label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> centrally manages labeling data, business unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>A, for example, can relocate products from manufacturing facility <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>A to manufacturing facility <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>B without needing to transfer labeling information, such as one or more digital files necessary to render a label. This process may be difficult with conventional desktop graphic design and label creation tools that typically execute on standalone workstations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Another feature of label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, as described below, is incorporation of revision control modules for developing and maintaining labeling data. Label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, for example, includes revision control modules for controlling labeling data through all stages of the process including developing the label, approving the label for use by manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and print center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and archiving and time stamping the label for subsequent verification. Label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> supports, for example, check-in and check-out procedures for controlling access to label templates, graphics, and label data generally. Furthermore, these features of label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be useful in tracking changes to labels and providing revision histories and other modification information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> support and facilitates &ldquo;on-demand&rdquo; print systems by streamlining the delivery of label data to such systems when needed. In other words, label data can be quickly distributed to print systems when a company decides to manufacture a product, thereby allowing the company to satisfy any &ldquo;just-in-time&rdquo; manufacturing and supply contracts and other business relationships the company may service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in further detail. Web servers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provide an interface by which users <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> communicate with label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via network <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. In one configuration, web servers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> execute web server software, such as Internet Information Server&trade; from Microsoft Corporation, of Redmond, Wash. As such, web servers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> provide an environment for interacting with users <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> according to software modules <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, which can include Active Server Pages, web pages written in hypertext markup language (HTML) or dynamic HTML, Active X modules, Lotus scripts, Java scripts, Java Applets, Distributed Component Object Modules (DCOM) and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Although illustrated as &ldquo;server side&rdquo; software modules executing within an operating environment provided by web server <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, software modules <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> could readily be implemented as &ldquo;client-side&rdquo; software modules executing on computing devices used by users <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Software modules <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> could, for example, be implemented as Active X modules executed by a web browser executing on the computing devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Software modules <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> may include a number of modules including template design tool <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, template manager <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, graphic design tool <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, graphic manager <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, administration (Admin) module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, output manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> and application programming interface (API) <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Software modules <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> interact with data server <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to access a number of data stores <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, including graphics <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>A, templates <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B, label records <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>C and configuration (config) data <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>D. Each data store <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may be implemented in a number of different forms including a data storage file, or one or more database management systems (DBMS) executing on one or more database servers. The database management systems may be a relational (RDBMS), hierarchical (HDBMS), multidimensional (MDBMS), object oriented (ODBMS or OODBMS) or object relational (ORDBMS) database management system. Furthermore, although illustrated separately, data stores <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> could be combined into a single database or other data storage structure. Data stores <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> could, for example, be implemented as a single relational database such as SQL Server from Microsoft Corporation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Graphics <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>A include corporate graphics, such as trademarks, logos and other imagery, for printing on labels. Graphics <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>A may be stored as, for example, individual image files stored in any of a number of formats including JPEG, TIFF, GIFF, PDF and the like. Templates <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B stores templates for creating labels and typically describes a layout, format and a number of fields. Label records <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>C store label data for a number of labels generated by users <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from label templates <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B. Configuration data <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>D stores configuration data including, for example, authorized users <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, user and corporate preferences, preferred output stock (substrates) for labels, and available printers. In addition, configuration data <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>D includes data defining business units <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, manufacturing sites <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, and the various packaging levels used during the manufacturing process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Template design tool <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> provides online label design and layout functionality for creating label templates. In other words, template design tool <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> presents a graphical user interface by which users <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can construct templates. During this process, a user <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> typically defines the size and layout for a template, as well as defining a number of fields for capturing label data, possibly at print time. Although illustrated and described as an online, web-based template design tool, template design tool <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> may comprise a conventional label design software, such as CodeSof&trade; and LabelView&trade; from Teklynx&trade;, and may run on independent computing devices. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Upon creating a label template, a user <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> interacts with template manager <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to &ldquo;check-in&rdquo; the template into label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. During this process, template manager <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> parses the data generated by template designer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, typically a text file with embedded codes defining a number of fields, and stores the parsed data within templates <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B. During the check-in process, the user provides all information necessary for categorizing the template including, for example, a name for the label template, appropriate business units <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> that may use the template, markets for which the label may be applicable, a &ldquo;trustee&rdquo; for the template, and the corresponding packaging level(s) for which the template applies. After describing the template, the user uploads the file produced by template design tool <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which stores the file in templates <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Similarly, graphic design tool <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> provides a web-based design tool for creating graphics such as corporate trademarks, logos, and the like. In other words, graphic design tool <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> presents a graphical user interface by which users <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> can construct images. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, uses <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may use a conventional graphic design software, such as Adobe Photoshop&trade; from Adobe System Incorporated or Corel Draw&trade; from Corel, Inc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> After creating graphics for corporate labels, a user <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> interacts with graphic manager <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to check-in the graphics into label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. During the process, the user <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> typically uploads the graphic file, such as a JPEG, GIF, TIFF or PDF file, to label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, which stores the file in graphics data store <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>A. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Administration (admin) module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> present an interface by which authorized users, such as system administrators, configure label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A system administrator may, for example, manage accounts for users <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> including setting access privileges, and define a number of corporate and user preferences. Examples of corporate preferences include preferred language translations, signature lines, suggested label stock. Examples of user preferences include authorized printers for each user, as well user access rights to modules <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Admin module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> allows the system administrator to define access rights for users <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to control the access to the various software modules <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In this manner, not all users can access all of the software modules <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. For example, a graphic designer may have access rights to graphic designer software module <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and graphics manager <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, while a plant operator may only have access rights for the output manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In addition, a system administrator can interact with admin module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> the administrator can define logical categories and hierarchies for characterizing and describing labels used for packaging and manufacturing. The system administrator may define, for example, categories such as markets, business units and a hierarchy of packaging levels, such as levels one through eight. In addition, the system administrator may define a number of label fields supported by label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> allows users <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to define labels for use on packaging and manufactured products, based on label templates <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B, graphics <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>A and config data <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>D. In other words, users <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> interact with record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to create new labels based on templates, and populate the fields of the templates with text, graphics or other data. Furthermore, record manager <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> allows a user to set various characteristics and properties for the defined fields for a label. A user may, for example, enable &ldquo;dynamic scaling&rdquo; for a text or graphic element field, causing label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to dynamically select a font size for corresponding text or dynamically scale the graphic element, so that the text or graphic element can be fully displayed within the label field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> integrates formal control modules and procedures to manage the process of developing and maintaining label records <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>C. Record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, for example, includes revision control modules for controlling the development of label records <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>C from creation to approval and archival. Record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> supports, for example, check-in and check-out mechanisms for controlling access to label records and tracks modifications to the records to provide revision histories and other modification information. Each label record has a corresponding status, such as draft, pending, approved, archived, obsolete and superceded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> Once a user <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> changes a status for a label record from &ldquo;draft&rdquo; to &ldquo;approved,&rdquo; record manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> generates an electronic image of the label, such as a PDF (portable document format) output, timestamps the image and archives the image. A version of the image may be stored as a low resolution &ldquo;thumbnail&rdquo; to facilitate ready identification by users without the need to retrieve the entire high-resolution image. Record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> associates data from the corresponding label record with the archived label image to allow for indexing and quick retrieval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Output manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> controls all aspects of label printing. Once a user <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has created a template and entered the template into label management system, created a corresponding record for the template and populated the fields of the template, output manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> makes the label available for printing at manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> or print center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Only records having an approved status are &ldquo;published&rdquo; to manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, i.e., are available to user <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> via the output manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. This gives business units <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> the ability to manage data, add new labels, update labels without concern about the possibility that one of manufacturing sites <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> may prematurely use an unapproved label. As described below, run-time fields can be added to the template during design, which causes output manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to prompt for the information at the time of print. Examples of run-time information include batch code, lot code, manufacture date, serial numbers and the like. In one embodiment, label management system stores the run-time data as labels are printed for tracking and tracing purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Application programming interface (API) <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> provides the ability to establish direct connections with external computing devices, allowing such devices to automatically control label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A front-end module, such as a script or command line interface provided by the remote computing device, for example, may communicate with API <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> directly, bypassing the interfaces presented by other software modules <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. In this manner, the front-end module can automatically interact with label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and control output. As a result, API <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> can be useful when connecting to internal corporate systems to incorporate, for example, product information. In addition, API <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be used at manufacturing time to automatically provide run-time information for labels and other printed materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flow chart illustrating central management of labeling data for packaging and manufactured products according to the invention. Initially, an authorized user, such as a system administrator interacts with admin module <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to configure label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> setting up user accounts, defining preferences, access rights, and logical categories such as markets, business units and packaging levels (<highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Next, authorized users of business units <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) interact with template design tool <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and template manager <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to develop and manage label templates (<highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>). Similarly, authorized users of business units <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> interact with graphic design tool <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and graphic manager <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to develop and manage corporate approved graphics for printing on the labels (<highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>). Authorized users of business units <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> then interact with record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to create label records based on the templates, and populate the fields of the templates with text, graphics or other data (<highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>). Remote manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, print centers <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> or other output locations interact with output manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> to retrieve and print approved labels for packaging and manufactured products (<highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> illustrates an example web-based user interface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> presented by template manager <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. An authorized user can check-in templates to label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by clicking on the Add button <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, at which time label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> automatically assigns a unique template ID <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and initializes a publication status <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to &ldquo;Draft.&rdquo; At this time, the user can assign a template name <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> Interface <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> provided by template manager <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> supports the logical categories defined by the corporation for managing templates throughout business units <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. When adding a new template, for example, the user may mark the template as global to make the template available throughout the company. Alternatively, the user may specify a packaging level, business unit and market for the template. The trustee <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> indicates the user that has authority to modify the template being checked-in, typically the user that created the template using graphic design tool <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Often, a template may supersede an older template, as identified by window <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. Template size <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, such as 5&times;7, indicates the physical size of the template when printed. All of the parameters and attributes captured by template manager <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> will be stored in label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and be available later to the user via other software modules <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, including record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and output manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The user can suggest print material for the label within window <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. When printing the label, as described below, the output manager displays the suggested print material to aid the operator. Finally, the user can attach a template file produced by the template designer <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> by entering a filename within window <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Search window <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> allows the user to locate one of stored label template <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>B instead of creating a new template. After finding a template, the user can modify the parameters and select change button <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. After finalizing the template, the user can &ldquo;approve&rdquo; the template by selecting the approve button <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, thereby marking the template as available for use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> illustrates an example web-based user interface <highlight><bold>87</bold></highlight> presented by graphics manager <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. An authorized user can check-in graphics to label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by clicking on the Add button <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> after completing the various fields presented by interface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, at which time label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> automatically assigns a unique graphic ID and initializes a status for the graphic to &ldquo;Draft.&rdquo; Typically, the user assigns a graphic name <highlight><bold>89</bold></highlight>, provides a short description <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and provides a location <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> where the graphic file is located. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> After checking in the graphic, the user can modify the data describing the graphic, or update the image itself. Interface <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> provides viewer <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> by which the user can preview the image during the check-in and modification process. Upon approving the graphic, by selecting the Approve button <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>, graphic manager <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> changes the status to approved and records the date approved <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> illustrate an example web-based user interface <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> presented by record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. Generally, interface <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> allows users to define labels for use on packaging and manufactured products using on label templates and graphics uploaded to label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by template manager <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and graphics manager <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, respectively. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, users interact with interface <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> presented by record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to provide data for the fields of a selected template. The user may, for example, associate a field with text, graphics or other data. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> To create a label record, a user having rights to access record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> selects New Record button <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> at which time label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> automatically assigns a unique label ID <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and initializes a status <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for the record to &ldquo;Draft.&rdquo; The unique label ID is useful for compliance with regulations, such as the regulations found in the health care and pharmaceutical industries that require a labeling change management process, for example utilizing a single, unique control number for each label. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> The user may also select a pre-existing label record and make changes. Interface <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> offers two mechanisms for selecting a record. The user may traverse the logical categories defined for label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> by providing, for example, a corporate label ID <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, a packaging level <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, and a corresponding manufactured part or product <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. For a given corporate ID number <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, there may be a number of records covering the various packaging levels. These records form a related family that can share common data, such as a message or warning text that must be displayed on labels for all packaging levels. The second method for finding a label is to supply the unique label ID <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> displays a number of graphic thumbnails from which the user selects a desired label template. Record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> then graphically displays graphics associated with the selected label template and overlays the corresponding fields. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> When creating a label record, label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> allows the users to control when manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> use an updated label. This may be useful in heavily regulated industries where the manufacturing company may need to record the specific point where labels change, such as in the medical and pharmaceutical industries. In particular, the user can classify the record as &ldquo;pass through&rdquo; or as &ldquo;non-pass through.&rdquo; The output manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> uses an updated label immediately if the label is designated as &ldquo;pass through.&rdquo; Once a user has approved a pass through label record, the old record is immediately replaced and an image of the label for the old record is archived in a graphic format, such as PDF, to create a permanent record of the old label. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> For non-pass through labels, output manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> allows the manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to control when the updated label record is used in place of the superceded label record. This allows the manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to print the older labels for a desired period of time, such as until the end of a batch run or the depletion of current inventory. During this process, label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> automatically maintains a duplicate label record within label records <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>C controlled by the corporate ID number. Manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can elect when to replace the old record with the updated one. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> Interface <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> provides a number of data entry windows <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> for mapping information, such as text and graphics, to corresponding fields within the selected label template. In other words, data entry windows <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> present the logical elements of information that may exist on approved corporate packaging labels, and are initially defined by a system administrator or other authorized user. In one embodiment, interface <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> displays only the fields that exist on the selected template. In this embodiment, record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> determines the defined fields for the corresponding label template and presents those fields within data entry windows <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Data entry windows <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> may require that the input from the user match constraints defined within template manager <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> during template creation. In this manner, the template may control the number of characters and format for each field. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> Product data entry window <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>A captures product specific data for the selected label record and includes three windows including main product data entry window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>A, origin-address data entry window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>B and free text data entry window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>C. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, origin-address data entry window <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>B allows a user to specify a country of origin <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> for the product, translations <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> that are available for the label, and an address <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> of the manufacturer. Free text data allows the user to add miscellaneous messages such as &ldquo;50% off&rdquo; or &ldquo;Buy one get one free&rdquo; to a label. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrates packaging level data entry window <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B of user interface <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Packaging level data entry window <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>B allows the user to identify the packaging levels for a manufacturing product. In particular, the user can define the quantity <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> of the product within each of packaging levels <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, and define various features, such as size and weight, at each level. In addition, the user may select graphical icons representing the components and container for each packaging level. Window <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> graphically illustrates the packaging process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> illustrates template-part data entry window <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>C of user interface <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. Template-part data entry window <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>C allows the user to identify the corresponding template <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> for the current label record, and displays an image <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> that graphically illustrates the label as well as the corresponding fields <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> associated with the label. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> illustrates graphics data entry window <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>D of user interface <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> that allows the user to assign graphics <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> for the various fields <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> within the template. Graphics <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> can be can be any type of format including BITMAP, JPEG, TIFF, GIFF, EPS, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> illustrates translations data entry window <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>E of user interface <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> that allows the user to select one or more languages <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> for the label and enter translation text <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight> for one or more fields. In this manner, any text on the label can be multilingual. In one embodiment, label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is Unicode compliant and can readily support a wide variety of character sets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, once the user has completed the data entry process, the user can approve the label by selecting Approve button <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Upon approval, record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> generates an image, such as a PDF file, of the resultant label based on the graphics and other data associated with the fields of the selected label. In addition, record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> timestamps the image and archives the image to record a visual representation of the exact label that is available for use by manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> associates data from the current record with the archived image to allow for indexing and quick retrieval. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> illustrate an example web-based user interface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> presented by output manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. Generally, interface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> controls all aspects of label printing by manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12, a</cross-reference> user, such as a plant operator within one of manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, first interacts with data source selection window <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to elect whether to retrieve label data from label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via network <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, or from a local copy of data stores <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. This option is useful to maintain manufacturing even in situation where network <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is unavailable. Specifically, label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may replicate data stores <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, or portions thereof, to local servers within each manufacturing facility <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and print center <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> After selecting the data source, the user then selects a desired label record using search window <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. In particular, the user can enter a unique label ID, or a corporate ID and corresponding packaging level and part. Only label records having an approved status are available to the user via output manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. This gives business unit <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> the ability to manage label data, create new labels, and update labels without worrying about the manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> prematurely using non-approved labels. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>, once a label is identified, output manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> retrieves the detailed data for the label from label records <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>C and displays the data within window <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight>. Interface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> displays this information in non-editable form for verification by the user. In addition, interface <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> displays any run-time fields <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, such as fields <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, for capturing data as, for example, lot number and batch code. Next, the plant operator selects a quantity <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and an available printer <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. As described above, output manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> controls the list of available printers <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> based on access settings within config data <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>, viewing approved labels window <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> of output manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> provides the ability to verify a printed label in comparison with the approved label as archived by record manager <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. More specifically, the user may typically print a single label and compare the printed label against the archived image displayed in view screen <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. Verification against the archived label is more accurate than performing a print preview, as commonly available in conventional systems. A print preview only displays the label that is about to be printed, versus displaying the exact approved version. This feature may be particularly useful for regulated industries. Upon verifying the label, the user select a print mode and quantity, and print either individually, continuously, or a combination thereof Alternatively, the user may store the generated labels to a computer-readable file in a variety of formats, such as EPS or bitmap. The user may then ship the generated label to a high-end print service for printing large volume batches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> is a block diagram illustrating a system <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> in which label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> hosts labeling data for a plurality of organizations <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>C, collectively referred to as organizations <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, thereby allowing organizations <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> to centrally manage labeling data for packaging and manufactured products generally. Each of organizations <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> may include one or more business units <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> that interact with label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via network <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to develop and manage the packaging labels or other printed material for manufactured products. Each organization <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> may also include remote manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, print centers or other output locations that interact with label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> via network <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> to retrieve label data for company approved labels when manufacturing products. In addition, an entity <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, such as entity <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>C, may not have separate business units <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> or manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, but may manage and output label data from a small number of locations, or even a single workstation and printer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In this configuration, label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> organizes label data within data stores <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> based upon the associated entity <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. In other words, all templates, users, graphics, records and other label data is related to one of organizations <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, and is not accessible by the other organizations <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> In this manner, label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may support organizations <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> of all sizes ranging from sole proprietorships to large corporations. Label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may charge business organizations <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> fees in a number of ways. Label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may, for example, charge organizations <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> data warehouse fees based on the number of label records, templates and graphics, or any combination thereof, stored by each of business organizations <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. Label management system may also charge fees based on the number of accesses by users within organizations <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>. In addition, label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may charge subscription service fees or fees based on the number of labels printed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be offered as a value-add service coupled with other services or packaging materials. For example, services provided by label management system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be offered to entities <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight> in conjunction with the sale of packaging material, such as packaging tape. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> illustrates two example labels <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> produced by output manager <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> at an output location such as one of manufacturing facilities <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>. Each label <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> includes a variety of text and graphics associated with fields of a respective label template by a corresponding label record. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> Various implementations and embodiments of the invention have been described.
