<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the material processing arts. It particularly relates to the coating or annealing of metal strips, such as carbon steel strips, in a controlled atmosphere using combustion furnace heating augmented by induction heating, and will be described with particular reference thereto. However, the invention will also find application in other material manufacturing and surface treatment processes that take place in a chamber inside which induction heating coils are advantageously disposed for controlled heating. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Many steel processing steps such as annealing, coating, galvannealing, and the like require thermal cycling of the subject steel, which steel is typically in the form of a strip, bar, tube, pipe, or other shape. The prior art includes combustion furnaces with augmentation by induction heating to effectuate the proper thermal cycle. Augmentation by induction heating increases furnace capacity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In order to be effective, the induction heating coils should closely coupled to the subject material, and preferably to the subject metal. However, the coils are typically disposed outside the furnace. This arrangement reduces inductive energy transfer to the steel due to the spatial separation. Improved coupling can be obtained by modifying the shape of the furnace shell, e.g. by necking down the furnace in the vicinity of the induction coils. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the coils can be placed inside the furnace. This arrangement has the advantage of close coupling between the coils and the steel strip or bar. However, placing the coils inside the furnace increases the likelihood of coil damage and failure due to impingement upon the closest structure in the confined interior space. Furthermore, the prior art methods for replacement of coils disposed inside the furnace typically involve a complete shutdown of furnace operations and removal of the damaged coil or coils, using a crane or other heavy machinery to access the furnace interior and remove the entire induction coil. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Generally, the root cause of failure in a furnace employing induction heating is impingement by the steel strip on the closest structure. In the case of induction coils arranged outside the furnace, this corresponds to impingement of the strip on the insulation at the necked-down region of the furnace. This insulation is preferably thin to improve heater coupling with the steel strip or bar. However, the insulation is also preferably thick enough to ensure adequate furnace insulation. Furthermore, the insulation should be as far away as possible from the strip to avoid contact therewith. Thus, compromises are made with respect to the insulation thickness and the size of the furnace opening in the necked-down region, and these compromises in turn limit the size of the steel strip or bar that can be accommodated by the furnace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> External placement of the coils advantageously enables coil replacement without shutting down the furnace. However, in this arrangement the closest structure to the strip is the insulation rather than the coil, and so insulation failure is more likely than coil failure. Insulation repair or replacement usually cannot be performed without a complete furnace shutdown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Locating the coil inside the furnace eliminates the need for necking-down the furnace shell and improves inductive coupling with the steel strip. However, with this arrangement the coils are the closest structure to the steel strip, and therefore the coils are the most likely element to fail. The coils can be encased in a refractory material to reduce the probability of damage thereto. However, the refractory introduces the disadvantages of less efficient coupling due to the intervening refractory material, and larger coil size. The increased coil size due to the additional refractory coating is particularly disadvantageous due to the limited space available inside the furnace. Also, in the event that the strip contacts the refractory material, contamination of the steel strip becomes a major quality issue. In the case of coil or refractory failure, the furnace usually must be completely shut down and the entire coil removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Locating a bare coil inside the furnace enables the maximum electrical efficiency along with the maximum strip movement without contact with any structures, e.g. the coils. However, coil repair of such prior art induction heating systems again typically involves a complete furnace shutdown and removal of the entire coil using a crane or other heavy machinery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention contemplates an improved induction coil which overcomes the aforementioned limitations and others. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> According to one aspect of the invention, an induction heater coil is disclosed for use in conjunction with an associated furnace for material processing, said furnace including at least a furnace shell. At least one essentially straight induction coil turn is arranged inside the furnace shell. The induction coil turn has an attachment end extending outside of the furnace shell through a first opening therein wherein a replacement induction coil is selectively connected with the essentially straight induction coil and slidably inserted into the furnace shell. The slidable insertion of the replacement coil turn simultaneously slidably pushes out the essentially straight induction coil turn through a second opening therein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Preferably, a seal is disposed between the essentially straight induction coil turn and the first opening in furnace shell. The seal supports the essentially straight induction coil turn in the furnace and essentially seals the interface between the essentially straight induction coil turn and the furnace shell opening against substantial leakage of a gas contained within the furnace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Preferably, an insulating material is disposed between the essentially straight induction coil turn and the first opening in the furnace shell. The insulating material supports the essentially straight induction coil turn in the furnace. The insulating material preferably includes a calcium silicate board. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the attachment end includes a threading arranged on an end of the essentially straight induction coil turn. The connection of the replacement induction coil turn can include an interconnecting element having a first threading that mates with the threading arranged on an end of the induction coil turn. The connection of the replacement induction coil turn to the essentially straight induction coil turn preferably further includes an attachment end of the replacement induction coil turn that has a threading arranged on an end of the replacement induction coil turn that mates with a second threading of the interconnecting element. In a preferred embodiment of the interconnecting element, the first threading and the second threading of the interconnecting element constitute a single threading. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The induction coil can include a plurality of coil turns arranged in the furnace shell to essentially conform with a catenary of an essentially horizontally oriented strip of material under processing by the furnace. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The essentially straight induction coil turn preferably further includes a hollow portion through which water cooling is selectively flowed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The essentially straight induction coil turn optionally further includes a refractory ceramic coating disposed on at least a portion of the outer surface thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, a method is disclosed for replacing an induction coil turn arranged inside a furnace. A replacement induction coil turn is connected to the induction coil turn at an end of the induction coil turn that extends beyond a shell of the furnace. The connecting forms a replacement induction coil turn-induction coil turn assembly. The replacement induction coil turn-induction coil turn assembly is slidably moved, thereby sliding the induction coil turn out of the furnace while simultaneously sliding the replacement induction coil turn into the furnace. The induction coil turn is disconnected from the replacement induction coil turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Preferably, during the sliding step, a sealing of an interface between the replacement induction coil turn-induction coil turn assembly and the furnace is obtained, that substantially reduces leakage of a gas contained within the furnace. The sealing preferably further includes sealing the interface with an insulating material that additionally supports the replacement induction coil turn-induction coil turn assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The step of connecting a replacement induction coil turn to the induction coil turn preferably includes the steps of attaching a first end of an interconnecting element onto the induction coil turn, and attaching a second end of the interconnecting element onto the replacement coil turn. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the step of connecting a replacement induction coil turn to the induction coil turn includes the steps of threadedly attaching a first end of a threaded linear element onto the induction coil turn, and threadedly attaching the replacement coil turn onto a second end of the threaded linear element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The method preferably further includes reducing, at least during the sliding step, a pressure inside the furnace below an operating pressure thereby reducing leakage of a gas contained within the furnace during the sliding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The method preferably further comprises continually operating an auxiliary heating system and thereby maintaining the furnace at a preselected temperature at least during the connecting, sliding, and disconnecting steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The method preferably further comprises continuously operating a combustion heater associated with the furnace during at least the connecting, sliding, and disconnecting steps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> According to yet another aspect of the invention, a method is disclosed for replacing an essentially linear element disposed in a furnace. The element has a first end extending outside the furnace through a first furnace opening, and a second end aligned with a second furnace opening. A replacement essentially linear element is detachably attached to the first end of the essentially linear element. The attaching producing an essentially linear assembly of the replacement element and the element. The assembly of the replacement element and the element is slidably moved to effectuate an ejecting of the element through the second furnace opening and an insertion of the replacement element in place of the element. The element is detached from the replacement element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the step of detachably attaching includes the steps of attaching an interconnecting element to the first end of the element and attaching the interconnecting element to an end of the replacement element, while the step of detaching the element from the replacement element includes the step of detaching the interconnecting element from the replacement element. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> One advantage of the present invention is that it permits replacement of damaged induction coil turns without a complete shutdown of furnace operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the present invention is that it enables replacement of induction coil turns arranged inside a furnace without the use of a crane or other heavy machinery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Yet another advantage of the present invention is that, once the power ports are in place, the entire induction coil can be assembled on-site. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Still yet another advantage of the present invention is that an induction coil can be constructed to follow the expected strip catenary on a horizontal application in an easy way, whereby the likelihood of impingement between the strip and the coil is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Still further advantages and benefits of the present invention will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> With reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a preferred embodiment of a furnace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having an induction heater formed in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention is described. The furnace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and an induction heater <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The induction heater <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> preferably includes a plurality of induction coils <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> two induction coils <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Each induction coil <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> which shows an enlarged view of the turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that make up the two induction coils <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>viewed in the direction A as indicated on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> after removal of electrical lead lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In the exemplary <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, each induction coil <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>includes eleven coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Each coil turn <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is essentially straight and passes through the furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> so that only the ends of the induction coil turn <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> protrude from sides of the furnace shell as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The induction heater <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> additionally preferably includes water cooled lead lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that provide electrical power to the induction coils <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>and preferably operatively connect with the induction coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in any conventional manner, e.g. by a threaded connection. The coils <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are typically disposed in power ports <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that are cut out of the furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. An a.c. electrical induction power supply <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> provides electrical power for the induction heater <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> via the water cooled lead lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and is also preferably of a conventional type known to the art. Typically, the ends of the coil turns of a coil <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>opposite the side where the electrical power is applied are connected by copper water cooled electrical conductors or the like (not shown) to reduce resistive losses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The furnace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be adapted to perform thermal annealing, surface coating, galvannealing, and other materials processing that require a thermal cycling of the subject material. In a typical arrangement, the subject material is a steel strip (not shown) that passes through the furnace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in continuous fashion through openings <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in opposite sides of the furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The rows of furnace coils <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are preferably arranged in close proximity on either side of the strip for efficient inductive coupling therewith. The furnace optionally includes numerous additional features known to the art which are not shown here, such as gas inlets to admit nitrogen or other process gases, valving for controlling the ambient pressure in the furnace, and mechanical means for loading, transporting, and removing the subject material, e.g. strip, pipe, etc. The furnace also preferably includes an auxiliary heating means (not shown) such as a combustion heater, which operates in conjunction with the induction heater <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to effect the desired thermal cycle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> With particular reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, each induction coil turn <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is essentially straight and preferably cylindrical in cross-section, although square or other cross-sectional shapes are also contemplated. Preferably, the coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> includes a coolant fluid conduit <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a hollow opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> that runs the length of the turn <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The coil turn <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> also preferably includes first and second ends <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that are adapted to receive an attachment to be used during the coil turn replacement process described later. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, the turn ends <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> include inside (ID) threading <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> for receiving an attachment. The ends <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> are preferably essentially identical to provide symmetry for the coil turn <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, although such symmetry is not a requirement of the invention. Preferably, the attachment threadings <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that provide attachment means for attaching a replacement coil turn during the coil turn replacement process (to be described later) additionally serve as the connecting means for connecting the lead lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The preferred embodiment thus provides an exceptionally simple and easily manufactured coil turn design. However, variations such as separate connecting means for the coil turn replacement and the lead lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are also contemplated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> The coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are preferably comprised of a copper alloy that provides mechanical strength, excellent electrical conductivity, and excellent thermal stability. The turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are preferably uncoated, i.e. bare coil turns. However, various coatings, such as a ceramic refractory coating (not shown), are also contemplated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> With continuing reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the positioning of the induction coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in the furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is now described in greater detail. The furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> (only a portion of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) preferably includes a first power port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through which first ends <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the induction coils <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> protrude. The second power port of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is preferably essentially similar to the first power port shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, and the two power ports <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are disposed at opposite ends of the furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> for receiving the first and second ends <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> so that each coil turn <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is suspended within the furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and is supported therein through the furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> near the two opposite coil ends <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> In order to electrically and thermally isolate the coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> from each other and from the furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, an insulating material <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is preferably arranged in the first power port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> so as to surround the first ends <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the induction coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the insulating material <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> is a calcium silicate board approximately 5 cm thick that provides both the thermal and the electrical insulation. The first ends <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are arranged in holes formed in the calcium silicate board. A similar arrangement is provided at the second power port so that the coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are supported near the first and second ends <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> by the calcium silicate boards disposed in the power ports <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the insulation <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> essentially fills the space between the coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the edges of the power port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> openings. The insulating material <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> preferably cooperates with the power port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> openings to support and hold the coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> without shifting or other substantial displacement of the coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> over time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> It will be appreciated that separate electrically insulating and thermally insulating materials (not shown) can be substituted for the combination insulation <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. Similarly, additional insulation (electrical, thermal or both) can be optionally included along with the calcium silicate insulating board to provide additional isolation. It is also to be appreciated that in the case of a furnace having a nitrogen gas or other controlled ambient atmosphere that is preferably maintained at a process-specific pressure, the insulating material <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> advantageously provides sealing of the power port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> opening against excessive leakage of the process gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> It is again emphasized that an arrangement essentially similar to the arrangement shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> for the first power port <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is preferably also disposed at an opposite end of the furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, i.e. at the second power port to provide support, electrical and thermal isolation, and optional sealing for the second ends <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which also preferably protrude beyond the furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> With particular reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the induction coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that make up the induction coils <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are shown in essentially straight rows. However, in the case of induction coils for use in a furnace that processes a strip of material in a horizontal position, the induction coils optionally include a curvature (not shown) of the rows of coil turns <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> that essentially matches the expected strip catenary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> With reference now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A, 5B</cross-reference>, and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C, a method for replacing an induction coil turn <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> performed in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention is described. Starting with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, two induction coil turns <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> are shown. The coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is to be replaced by a replacement coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>R, only a portion near an end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>R of which is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>. Coil turn replacement is typically done in response to the coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> being damaged by impingement with the processed material or in response to another failure of the coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Coil turn replacement can also be performed for other reasons, of course, such as during an upgrade of the induction heater <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Coil turns other than the coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, e.g. the coil turn <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, advantageously remain essentially undisturbed during the replacement process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Prior to the point in time shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>A, the water cooled electrical lead lines <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are removed (step not shown), so that the view looking in the direction A (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is obtained. In a first step of the coil turn replacement process, the replacement coil turn SOR is aligned with the coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which is positioned in the furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. This aligning can be performed manually, or the aligning can involve a crane or other machinery. In a preferred embodiment using copper alloy coil turns about 5 cm in diameter and about 3.3 meters long, manual aligning has been found to be satisfactory, so that additional machinery is not required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In a second step, the end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>R of the replacement coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>R is detachably attached to an end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to form an essentially rigid and essentially linear assembly comprising the replacement coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>R and the coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the detachable attaching is by an interconnecting element <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, which in the preferred embodiment is a threaded linear element, for example a stud with outside (OD) threading <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> that mates with inside (ID) threadings <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> on the ends <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>R. However, other interconnecting elements are also contemplated, as well as a direct connection, e.g. by mating threads (not shown) on the ends <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>R whereby the interconnecting element <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is dispensed with. The detachable attaching of the ends <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>R should preferably produce an essentially smooth profile across the connection that is unlikely to snag or catch the insulation <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> during the sliding step to be described next. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> Once the assembly is formed, with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference> the replacement coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>R is pushed into the furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> in the direction indicated by the force arrow <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. Preferably, the insulation <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> and the corresponding insulation at the opposite end of the furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> provides a sufficiently loose binding of the coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to enable a sliding movement of the coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> under the influence of the force <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that is transmitted through the replacement coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>R to the coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> through the interconnecting element <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. This sliding step continues, so that the replacement coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>R slides into the furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> while simultaneously the coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> slides out of the furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> At the point in time illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>C, the coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is fully ejected from the furnace shell <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the replacement coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>R has taken its place. At this point the detachable attachment is detached, e.g. by unscrewing the interconnecting element <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> from the end <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>R of the replacement coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>R (step not shown), the electrical connections are re-established, and the induction heater <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is again operable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that the furnace <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> need not be shut down during the coil turn replacement steps illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>A-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C. The induction heater <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> does have to be shut down. However, any auxiliary heating systems, such as a combustion heater, preferably remain fully functional and typically can be operated throughout the coil turn replacement process to maintain the furnace at a desired temperature. Similarly, process gases optionally continue to flow during the coil turn replacement process. However, because the sealing quality of the insulation <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> around the assembly of the coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and the replacement coil turn <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>R may be reduced due to the sliding motion, the pressure in the furnace is optionally reduced below the normal operating pressure during the coil turn replacement process to reduce leakage of process gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> A preferred embodiment of the apparatus and process has been described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>C, relating to a suspended induction coil turn and a method for replacing the same. However, it is to be appreciated that the invention will also find application in conjunction with other essentially linear elements that are suspended within a furnace in like manner. For example, the invention will find application in conjunction with robber rings for induction heaters, guide bars, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> The invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments. Obviously, modifications and alterations will occur to others upon reading and understanding the preceding detailed description. It is intended that the invention be construed as including all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof. </paragraph>
