<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to piezoelectric transformers, and more particularly to a piezoelectric transformer with multiple outputs comprising a plurality of output terminals in a fluorescent lamps stabilizer, which supplies stable voltages to more than two fluorescent lamps without a ballast capacitor. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Generally, a fluorescent lamp, which is a sort of a discharge tube, requires a high voltage at primary lighting in order to emit thermal electrons for an electric discharge. After electric discharge, a voltage supplied to a fluorescent lamp decreases according to an increment of current. Namely, the voltage has a negative resistance characteristic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A stabilizer of fluorescent lamp, which is a lighting lamp device, supplies a high voltage to the fluorescent lamp with the characteristic above for lighting the lamp at primary time, and keeps a regular luminosity by controlling a current of the lamp after the lighting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> illustrates a general block diagram of configuration of a stabilizer of fluorescent lamp. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, A</cross-reference> fluorescent lamp stabilizer comprises a rectifying section <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight> for rectifying from AC commercial supply voltage <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> into a DC voltage of some level, a power factor compensating section <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> for compensating the power factor to the output of the rectifying section <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>, which is generated by the fluctuation of the AC commercial supply voltage <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, an AC voltage generating section <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight> for converting a uniform DC current inputted from the power factor compensating section <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight> to AC voltage having a high frequency, and a resonating section <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> for outputting the AC voltage to the fluorescent lamp <highlight><bold>63</bold></highlight> by resonating the output voltage of the AC voltage generating section <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight>. The AC voltage generating section <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight> is called a inverter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Typically, the resonating section <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight> was formed to generate a resonance by an inductance of a wound-type transformer and capacitance of the capacitor by connecting the capacitor to the wound-type transformer. However, the wound-type transformer has problems that a defective proportion is high because of the material declination of core, and confidence of the stabilizer is lower. So a piezoelectric transformer is on an increasing trend instead of a wound-type transformer currently. The example above is the case that a fluorescent lamp is connected to a stabilizer </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> However, in case of lighting more than two fluorescent lamps by connecting the fluorescent lamps into one stabilizer, if one of numerous fluorescent lamps is lighted, other fluorescent lamps connected to the wound-type transformer in parallel is not lighted because a lower voltage is supplied to the other fluorescent lamps by lighting the one fluorescent lamp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, typically <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> depict more than two fluorescent lamps connected a stabilizer. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, each ballast capacitor(<highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>) is connected between lamps(<highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>) and transformers(<highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight>), although one of the fluorescent lamps is lighted fist, a voltage required for lighting the lamps at primary time can be supplied to other fluorescent lamps. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> illustrate a perspective view of a typical fluorescent lamp stabilizer with a plurality of fluorescent lamps. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the fluorescent lamp stabilizer for a plurality of fluorescent lamps having a piezoelectric transformer comprises a circuit section <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>, which includes the rectifying section <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>, the power compensating section <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, the AC voltage generating section <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight>, and the resonance capacitor of the resonating section <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight>, the piezoelectric transformer <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> of which input electrode is connected to the resonance capacitor of the circuit section <highlight><bold>711</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of ballast capacitors <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> being connected to output electrode of the piezoelectric transformer <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> in parallel. Wherein the number of ballast capacitors is same that of lamps. Furthermore, a plurality of fluorescent lamps <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> are connected to other terminal of the plurality of ballast capacitors <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> of the stabilizer <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the stabilizer for a plurality of fluorescent lamps having a wound-type transformer comprises a circuit section <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>, which includes the rectifying section <highlight><bold>621</bold></highlight>, the power compensating section <highlight><bold>622</bold></highlight>, the AC voltage generating section <highlight><bold>623</bold></highlight>, and the resonance capacitor of the resonating section <highlight><bold>624</bold></highlight>. And the stabilizer comprises the wound-type transformer <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> of which input electrode is connected to a resonance capacitor of the circuit section <highlight><bold>811</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of ballast capacitors <highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> being connected to output electrode of the wound-type transformer <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> in parallel. Furthermore, the plurality of fluorescent lamps <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are connected to other terminal of the plurality of ballast capacitors <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight> of the stabilizer <highlight><bold>71</bold></highlight> respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In the stabilizer above, because AC voltage supplied by the wound-type transformer <highlight><bold>712</bold></highlight> or the piezoelectric transformer <highlight><bold>812</bold></highlight> is divided equally among the plurality of fluorescent lamps via the ballast capacitor <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight>, the plurality of fluorescent lamps can be lighted at the same time. Wherein the ballast capacitor <highlight><bold>713</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>813</bold></highlight> has a high withstand voltage characteristic, and its size is also big. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, because the stabilizer needs the ballast capacitors in proportion to the number of the connected fluorescent lamp, a volume and the number of components increase, and a cost increases also. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention offers a piezoelectric transformer with multiple outputs for lighting a plurality of fluorescent lamps stably without a ballast capacitor by comprising a plurality of output electrode having a regular output characteristic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Moreover, the present invention provides a piezoelectric transformer with multiple outputs for causing a cost saving and a simple working of a stabilizer for a plurality of fluorescent lamps by comprising a plurality of output electrode having a regular output characteristic. </paragraph>
