<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">Low cross talk resistive cross point memory devices are provided, along with methods of manufacture and use. The memory device comprises a bit formed using a perovskite material interposed at a cross point of an upper electrode and lower electrode. Each bit has a resistivity that can change through a range of values in response to application of one, or more, voltage pulses. Voltage pulses may be used to increase the resistivity of the bit, decrease the resistivity of the bit, or determine the resistivity of the bit. Memory circuits are provided to aid in the programming and read out of the bit region. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to nonvolatile memory, and more particularly to a cross point structure utilizing electric pulse induced resistance change effects in magnetoresistive films. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Materials having a perovskite structure, among them colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) materials and high temperature superconductivity (HTSC) materials are materials that have electrical resistance characteristics that can be changed by external influences. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> For instance, the properties of materials having perovskite structures, especially for CMR and HTSC materials, can be modified by applying one or more short electrical pulses to a thin film or bulk material. The electric field strength or electric current density from the pulse, or pulses, is sufficient to switch the physical state of the materials so as to modify the properties of the material. The pulse is of low enough energy so as not to destroy, or significantly damage, the material. Multiple pulses may be applied to the material to produce incremental changes in properties of the material. One of the properties that can be changed is the resistance of the material. The change may be at least partially reversible using pulses of opposite polarity from those used to induce the initial change. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a memory structure is provided, which comprises a substrate, a plurality of bottom electrodes overlying the substrate, a plurality of top electrodes overlying the bottom electrodes forming a cross point memory structure. A perovskite material located at each cross point interposed between a top electrode and a bottom electrode, wherein the perovskite material acts as a bit. Each bit may act as a variable resistor within a memory circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> A low cross talk memory structure is formed by depositing and patterning a conductive material over a substrate to form at least one bottom electrode. A layer of insulating material, such as silicon dioxide, is deposited over the substrate and the at least one bottom electrode. At least one contact opening is etched through the insulating material to the underlying bottom electrode. A layer of perovskite material is deposited over the bottom electrode and the insulating material. The perovskite material is polished off of the surface of the insulating material so that perovskite material remains in the contact opening. At least one top electrode is formed such that it crosses over the bottom electrode at the position of the perovskite material forming a cross point. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A memory circuit may be formed on the substrate prior to formation of the memory structure. The memory circuit assists with the programming and read out of the memory structure. Forming the memory circuit prior to the memory structure reduces damage to the perovskite material due to additional subsequent processing following formation of the memory structure. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> A method for forming a low cross talk resistive memory array is provided. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a cross-sectional view of a cross point memory array area <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> following some initial processing. The memory array area <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a bottom electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> formed thereon. A layer of oxide <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, which is between approximately 300 nm and 800 nm, is deposited over the substrate, planarized and etched to form openings <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> to allow access to the bottom electrode. The thickness of the oxide over the bottom electrode is 50 nm to 600 nm depending on the material and the resistance desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is any suitable substrate material, whether amorphous, polycrystalline or crystalline, such as LaAlO<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>, Si, TiN or other material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The bottom electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are made of conductive oxide or other conductive material. In a preferred embodiment, the conductive material is a material, such as YBa<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>Cu<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>7 </subscript></highlight>(YBCO), that allows the epitaxial growth of an overlying perovskite material. In another preferred embodiment, the conductive material is platinum. The bottom electrodes are a thickness in the range of between about 5 nm and about 500 nm. As shown, the bottom electrodes are deposited and patterned without first forming a trench and without polishing. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> layer of perovskite material <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is deposited over the oxide <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> to fill the openings <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. The perovskite material <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> is a material capable of having its resistivity changed in response to an electrical signal. The perovskite material is preferably a colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) material or a high temperature superconducting (HTSC) material, for example Pr<highlight><subscript>0.7</subscript></highlight>Ca<highlight><subscript>0.3</subscript></highlight>MnO<highlight><subscript>3 </subscript></highlight>(PCMO). Another example of a suitable material is Gd<highlight><subscript>0.7</subscript></highlight>Ca<highlight><subscript>0.3</subscript></highlight>BaCo<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>O<highlight><subscript>5&plus;5</subscript></highlight>. The perovskite material is preferably between about 50 nm and 500 nm thick. The perovskite material <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be deposited using any suitable deposition technique including pulsed laser deposition, rf-sputtering, e-beam evaporation, thermal evaporation, metal organic deposition, sol gel deposition, and metal organic chemical vapor deposition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows the memory array area <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> following polishing of the perovskite material <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The perovskite material is preferably polished using CMP. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the memory array area <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> following deposition and patterning of top electrodes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The top electrodes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprise a conductive material, preferably platinum, copper, silver, or gold. The perovskite material that is now interposed between the bottom electrode <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and one of the top electrodes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is now a resistive memory bit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the cross point memory array area <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The memory array area <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> with a plurality of bottom electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> formed thereon. To illustrate another embodiment, the bottom electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are formed by forming a trench, depositing the conductive material and polishing the conductive material until level with the substrate. The polishing can be accomplished using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) or other suitable means. An oxide layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has been deposited overlying the plurality of bottom electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A plurality of top electrodes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> overly the oxide layer <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and the perovskite material <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> such that each memory bits <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is interposed between the bottom electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the top electrodes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> A transparent region <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (shown by a dashed circle) is used here to show the region as transparent for illustration purposes only, the material itself may or may not be transparent. Each bit region corresponds to a cross point. The oxide <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is contiguous with the bit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The oxide acts as an isolation material to reduce, or eliminate, cross talk between bits. Although, for ease of explanation oxide is referred to, it would also be possible to use other suitable insultating materials instead. The bit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> acts as a variable resistor that can be changed between at least two resistivity values. Changes to the resistivity of the bit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are preferably reversible. The reversibility of the resistivity change may incorporate some hysteresis. For some applications, such as write once read many (WORM) the resistivity change need not be reversible at all. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> For example, if the bit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has a cross sectional area of one micrometer by one micrometer and YBCO is used to form the bit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> with a thickness of 60 nm, the high resistance state is approximately 170 M&OHgr; and the low resistance state is approximately 10 M&OHgr;. For a low voltage memory device, if the bit <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is biased to 1 volt, the current through the bit will be approximately 6 nA for the high resistance state and approximately 100 nA for the low resistance state. This example has been provided for illustration purposes only. The resistance values will change depending upon the thickness, the material, and the cross sectional area of the bit. The voltage applied across the bit will further affect the current through the bit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The top electrodes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the bottom electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are each preferably substantially parallel rows. The top electrodes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the bottom electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are arranged in a cross point arrangement such that they cross each other in a regular pattern. A cross point refers to each position where a top electrode crosses a bottom electrode. As shown, the top electrodes and the bottom electrodes are arranged at substantially <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> degrees with respect to each other. The top electrodes and the bottom electrodes can each function as either word lines or bit lines as part of a cross point memory array. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows just the memory array area. It should be clear that in an actual device, the substrate <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, the bottom electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the top electrodes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may extend well beyond the memory array area to other areas containing other device structures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> memory device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprising the memory array area <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> connected to a memory circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is shown. The memory circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> comprises at least one bit pass transistor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> connected to at least one load transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and at least one inverter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. These structures are shown schematically, as the formation of the individual semiconductor elements are well known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of a method of making the memory device <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, one, or more, of transistor structures, interconnects or other components of the memory circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be formed prior to the formation of the memory array area <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. By forming components of the memory circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> prior to the memory array area <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, possible degradation of the perovskite material due to subsequent processing is reduced, or eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows a schematic diagram of a 16 bit, 4&times;4-memory array, memory block <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The memory block <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises the memory array area <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> connected to the memory circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In this schematic view the each bit is shown as being a bit resistor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> connected between the lower electrodes <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which are also designated as bit lines B<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through B<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, and the upper electrodes <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, which are also designated as word lines W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through W<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the lower electrodes could be the word lines and the upper electrodes could be the bit lines. The bit lines are connected to the memory circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. As shown, the lower electrodes are bit lines, so the lower electrodes are connected to the memory circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The bit resistor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> has a resistance that can be changed between at least two values, including a high resistance state and a low resistance state, in response to an electrical signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring now to the memory circuit <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, each bit line is connected to the bit pass transistor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The bit pass transistor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has a bit pass gate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>. The bit pass gate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> contributes to determining which bit is being programmed or read out. The bit pass transistor is connected to the load transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>, which has a load gate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and the inverter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The load transistor is used to determine which memory block is being programmed or read out. The inverter is used in combination with the load transistor to set the output between two voltage levels, so that a binary state can be read out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Once a device is completed and in operation, it can be programmed and read. It may also be desirable to set all of the bit resistors <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, especially those along a single word line, to the same resistance level either high resistance or low resistance. This may be used to produce a word erase or a block erase. For example, if n-channel transistors are used for the pass transistor and the load transistor, applying a negative voltage, or a plurality of negative voltage pulses, to a word line (e.g. W<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>) and grounding the bit pass gate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and the load transistor gate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of the memory block <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, sets all bit resistors <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at the cross point of the word line to the same resistance state, either high resistance or low resistance. It would also be possible to use positive voltages at the word line, provided the bit pass gate and the load gate are properly biased to allow current to flow through the bit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, p-channel transistors may be used for the bit pass transistor and the load transistor. In which case a positive voltage could be applied to the word line while grounding the bit pass gate and the load gate. A negative voltage pulse may be used provided that a sufficiently negative voltage is applied to the bit pass gate and the load gate to allow current to flow through the bit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The applied voltage, or the plurality of voltage pulses, is preferably at a level that will not damage the perovskite material. Preferably, all bit resistors <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> at the cross point of the word line will be set to the high resistance level. If a single pulse is not sufficient to change the resistivity of the bit region, multiple voltage pulses, at a level lower than the level at which the perovskite material would be damaged, can be used to affect the change. By repeating the process with the remaining word lines, the entire memory block can be set to the same state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> The bit <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> can be programmed by applying an on voltage to the bit pass gate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, applying a second on voltage to the load gate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and applying at least one programming voltage pulse to the word line. The voltage pulse applied to the word line is the opposite polarity to the polarity used for the word, or block, erase, such that the resistivity of the bit resistor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is changed to the opposite resistivity state. If n-channel transistors are used as described above in one embodiment, the programming pulse will be positive and the resistance of the bit resistor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> will preferably change from a high resistance state to a low resistance state. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The bit pass gate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of any unselected bits and the load transistor gate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of any unselected memory blocks <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are connected to ground. Any voltage at the cross point of the word line and bit line will be very small, such that no significant change in resistance will occur at unselected bits. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> As discussed above, the polarity and the voltage applied at the word line, the bit pass gate, and the load gate can be selected depending on whether n-channel or p-channel transistors are used to obtain the desired behavior of the memory circuit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The bit can be read. A load voltage is applied to the load gate <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The load voltage is smaller than the threshold voltage of the load transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. In addition, at this load voltage the saturation current of the load transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is larger than the current flow through the bit resistor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> when it is at a high resistance level. But, at this load voltage the saturation current of the load transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is lower than the current flow through the bit resistor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> when it is at a low resistance level. The bit pass gate <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is held at a voltage sufficient to allow current to flow through the bit pass transistor <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, for example V<highlight><subscript>cc</subscript></highlight>. A readout voltage is applied to the word line. The voltage applied to the word line is preferably a pulse with a voltage lower than the critical voltage necessary to change the resistivity of the bit resistor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> If the bit resistor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is at a high resistance state, the current flow through the bit resistor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is smaller than the saturation current of the load transistor <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The bit line voltage is then lower than the threshold voltage of an n-channel transistor at an input of the inverter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The output voltage of the inverter is then equal to approximately its power supply voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> If the bit resistor <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is at a low resistance state a large current tends to flow through the bit resistor. This large current is larger than the saturation current of the load transistor. The bit line voltage is larger than the threshold voltage of an n-channel transistor at an input of the inverter <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The output voltage of the inverter is then equal to approximately zero volts, which corresponds to ground. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Using the example discussed above, the current through the bit is expected to be between 6 nA and 100 nA. The bias voltage applied at the load gate of the load transistor should be selected so that the saturation current of the load transistor is between 6 nA and 100 nA, for example 50 nA. If the resistance of the bit is high enough that the current through it is less than 50 nA current will not flow through the load transistor and the output of the inverter will go to the operation voltage, for example Vcc. If the resistance of the bit is low, so that more than 50 nA flow through it, the current will flow through the load transistor and the output of the inverter will go to approximately 0 volts, or ground. If it is desired to have the bit at high resistance correspond to 0 volts, and the bit at low resistance correspond to the operation voltage, an additional inverter can be added at the output of the inverter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Although a preferred embodiment, and other embodiments have been discussed above, the coverage is not limited to these specific embodiments. Rather, the claims shall determine the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
