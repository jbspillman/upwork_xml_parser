<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a line-of-cut indicator for use with a cutting tool, and more specifically, to a line-of-cut indicator having a pointer assembly attached to the footplate of a cutting tool whereby the pointer assembly can rotate or slide between an open and closed position. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Indicators for use with cutting tools, such as circular saws, jig saws, miter saws and others, provide a user with a reference point that is located in front of the blade of a cutting tool. This reference point generally serves as a guide for the user to position and move the blade along a particular desired line of cut on the workpiece. Most prior art cut indicators provide the user with only a single reference point with which to make the cut, such that the user is unaware if the blade is properly aligned. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The prior art proposes various line-of-cut indicators. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,924,207 to Price et al. discloses a hand-held circular saw having a window assembly on its base to indicate the position of the saw blade with respect to a reference line on a workpiece. U.S. Pat. No. 5,881,784 to Morikawa et al. discloses a biscuit cutter having an adjustable fence having an aperture with a center line mark to assist in alignment during a cutting operation. In addition, U.S. Pat. No. 4,589,208 to Iwasaki et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,450,627 disclose stationary line of cut indiators that provide only a single reference point along a reference line marked on a workpiece. Except for the device of Morikawa et al., each of these prior art devices teaches a stationary reference indicator. The Morikawa et al. device teaches hingedly attaching an alignment mechanism through a simple hinge which serves to maintain the alignment plate in its downward position using a knob which is manually tightened against the plate. Thus, one important drawback of such prior art devices is that, particularly for the devices that are directed to alignment mechanisms that protrude beyond the front of the tool, if the tool is inadventently hit or jarred against a workpiece, there is a possibility that the alignment mechanism will get broken or damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> There are also other disadvantages to such prior art designs. For instance, in one example the window assembly is located on the footplate, just in front of the blade. As a result, the user must lean over the blade to have a clear view of the workpiece through the window assembly. In other words, a short line of sight for viewing the cut exists. Furthermore, the window assembly is not removable for use with other cutting tools and requires a shoe to have an opening therethrough, so its use is limited to hand-held circular saws having an opening in the shoe of the saw. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> What is needed is a line-of-cut indicator that is able to conveniently move between an open and a closed position, such as by rotating or sliding, so as not to break off or get damaged in the event it is inadventently hit with a workpiece. What is also needed is such a line-of-cut indicator that provides at least two points of reference for the user, thus providing a better accuracy for alignment of the cut. Furthermore, what is needed is a line-of-cut indicator that extends past the front of the footplate of the cutting tool and thereby reduces the need for the user to lean over the cutting tool to view the line-of-cut thereby substantially increasing safety and aligned cutting accuracy. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention satisfies the foregoing and overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art. The present invention provides a line-of-cut indicator that is attached to the footplate for use with a variety of cutting tools and allows for easier adjustment thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention reduces the risk of breakage or damage to the indicator by providing a line-of-cut indicator that rotates or slides from an opened to a closed position such that, in the event the indicator comes into contact with a foreign object or a part of a workpiece, the indicator will move to its closed and more protected position, without breaking or damaging the indicator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention also improves cutting accuracy by extending the line-of-cut marking beyond the front edge of the footplate. Furthermore, accuracy is improved by providing at least two points of reference with the line-of-cut indicator of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> According to the present invention, provided herein is a line-of-cut indicator for use with a cutting tool having an indicator assembly attached to a footplate of a cutting tool. According to one embodiment, the indicator of the present invention preferably has at least two points of reference for guiding a line of cut. The indicator is also adapted to be rotatably or slidably attached to the footplate.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Turning first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is illustrated, in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention, a line-of-cut indicator assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> provided on the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of a cutting tool. According to this embodiment of the invention, the indicator assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is comprised of a a generally transversely extending back rail <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, a generally longitudinally extending first side rail <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and a generally longitudinally extending second side rail <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, all of which are attached to the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> thereby forming a generally U-shaped opening <highlight><bold>85</bold></highlight> in the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. In addition, the indicator assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a pointer frame assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprised of a generally transversely extending front member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, a generally longitudinally extending first side segment <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and a generally longitudinally extending second side segment <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, which together form a generally U-shaped configuration complementary to that formed from the rails <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The pointer frame assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is disposed such that first and second side segments <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> slide into the first and second side rails <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, respectively. Furthermore, the first and second side segments <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> may be provided with teeth <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> on the upper part of the segments <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> for guiding and locking within the first and second side rails <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> respectively, which rails <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be provided with complementary teeth, projection of other element to engage teeth <highlight><bold>75</bold></highlight> to retain the first and second side segments <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> in a particular position. The back rail <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the front member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> may be provided with guide marks <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> to provide at least two points of reference for aligning a workpiece having a marked cutting line prior to and during the use of a cutting tool. By sliding the pointer frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in and out of the side rails <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the pointer frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be moved from a completely extended position where the front member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>is disposed farthest from the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (extending beyond the front of the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> approximately the length of the side rails <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>), to a completely retracted position where the front member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is substantially adjacent to the front of the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the pointer frame <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will be disposed so as to slide generally parallel to the plane of the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and in the same plane as the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, as illustrated, so that the indicator assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is disposed close to or adjacent to a marked cut line of a workpiece. The indicator assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may be fabricated from metal or plastic or similar materials. One important aspect of the present invention over the prior art, is that when the pointer frame assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is accidentally hit against a workpiece or other object (such as might happen during initial alignment with a workpiece for a cutting operation), instead of being damaged or broken, the pointer assembly <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> will slide from its extended to its retracted position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is illustrated another embodiment of the present invention. According to that embodiment, there is provided a line-of-cut indicator assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprised of a generally U-shaped pointer frame <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> provided on a footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of a cutting tool. The U-shaped pointer frame <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> has a generally transversely extending top member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, a generally longitudinally extending first side member <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and a generally longitudinally extending second side member <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. The top and side members <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> may be fabricated from a single material, such as a stamped metal plate, as illustrated, or molded piece of plastic, or the members may be individually fabricated and joined together. In accordance with the invention, U-shaped pointer frame assembly <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is hingedly attached to the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. As illustrated by way of example, the hinged attachment may be accomplished with a pair of pins <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> extending from the side members <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and which are engaged for rotational movement by generally U-shaped retention members <highlight><bold>145</bold></highlight> attached to the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. As can be seen, the U-shaped pointer frame <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is rotatable with respect to the pins <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and may be rotated to an extended position (as illustrated) where the the frame lies substantially in the same plane as the footplate and may be rotated to a retracted position where the pointer frame <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is folded back on top of the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the top member <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> are provided with guide marks <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> providing at least two points of reference when aligning the cutting tool with a marked cutting line of a workpiece. According to an aspect of the present invention, if the pointer frame <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is hit or jarred when in its extended position, the point frame will rotate back to its retracted position, instead of being damaged or broken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> which includes a line-of-cut indicator assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and a pointer frame <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>. The pointer frame <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> has a generally transversely extending top member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> for use as a pointer, a generally longitudinally extending first side segment <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, a generally longitudinally extending second side segment <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and a generally transversely extending bottom member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The generally planar footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has a first tab <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> having a cam surface <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> and a second tab <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. The tabs <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may be bent up from the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> (which may be fabricated from stamped steel), and each of the tabs <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> have an opening <highlight><bold>215</bold></highlight> therethrough for reception of a pin <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight> on one end and a screw <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> on the other end. The bottom member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the pointer frame <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> may be provided with a plurality of fingers <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> to threadedly receive the screw <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. The pointer frame <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> is thereby rotatably attached to the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The first side segment <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is provided with an integrated leaf spring <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> that engages the cam surface <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> of the first tab <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The integrated leaf spring <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> interacting with the cam surface <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, urges the pointer frame <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> to either an opened, unfolded position or a closed, folded position. Thus, in the event the pointer frame <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> is in an opened position and the pointer frame is jarred or hit by an object, the leaf spring <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> interacting with the cam surface <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight> operates to urge the pointer frame <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> into a closed position where the frame <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> is maintained substantially adjacent to the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, the pointer frame assembly <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> may also be provided with a screw <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, the head of which may be maintained in contact with the tab <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> extending from the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. The leaf spring <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, in addition to promoting a camming action to maintain the pointer frame <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> in either an open or closed position, also urges the head of the screw <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> against the tab <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. Thus, by rotating the screw <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> with respect to the fingers <highlight><bold>265</bold></highlight> of the pointer frame <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> into which it is threaded, the position of the pointer frame <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> may be laterally adjusted with respect to the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to ensure that the guide marks <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> on the pointer frame <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> are properly aligned. As illustrated, the top member <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> and bottom member <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the pointer frame <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> have guide marks <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> that provide at least two points of reference for aligning with respect to a marked cut line of a workpiece. While the pointer frame <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> may be fabricated from a variety of different materials, it may be preferable to fabricate the frame <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> from plastic. A plastic frame could be easily molded to provide the pin <highlight><bold>295</bold></highlight>, the frame members <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, a leaf spring type element <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> as well as a plurality of fingers which may threadedly receive the screw <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference> illustrate another embodiment of the present invention providing a line-of-cut indicator assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> attached to a generally planar base <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> which is secured to a footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> with, for example, a screw <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, the base <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be provided with hole <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> that is slotted, such that the lateral position of the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may be adjusted within the distance allowed by the slot <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. The screw <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> may be tightened to maintain the assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the desired lateral position. (Alternatively, there may be provided a pair of screws <highlight><bold>380</bold></highlight> each of which fits into a slot <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> in the base <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>). The pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may be fabricated from clear plastic and has a top edge <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and a bottom edge <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may be provided with a pin <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> having a camming surface <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> such that the pin fits into a recess of the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the camming surface <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> interacts with a complementary camming surface <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> of the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. On the other side of the pointer element, the base <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> contains another pin <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> that fits into a recess of the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. Preferably, a compression spring <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> will be included on the pin between the base and the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to urge the camming surface <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> of the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> against the camming surface <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The compression spring <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> and the cam surfaces <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> of the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the base <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> act in concert, rotatably urging the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> between either an open (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) or a closed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) position. The top edge <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight> and bottom edge <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> of the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> have guide marks <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> for use as reference points. In addition, the base <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> has further guide marks <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> on both a front edge <highlight><bold>385</bold></highlight> and a rear edge <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight> of the base <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. The pointer frame <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may be solid, made preferably of a transparent plastic, but may be made of any other transparent material as well. Preferably, the base <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> may also be provided with an opening <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight> such that the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> may also provide line of cut guidance in a closed position, because the marked cut line on the workpiece may seen from the opening with respect to the markings <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> on the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>. While in the open position, the two pairs of markings <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> on the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> as well as markings <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> on the base <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight> provide at least 3 aligned points of reference for a cut. While in the closed position, the two pairs of markings <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> on the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>, which may be aligned with a marked cut line of a workpiece visible through the transparent pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the opening <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight> in the footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, provide at least two points of reference for a cut. In addition, even in the closed position, the markings <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> on the base <highlight><bold>395</bold></highlight> may be visible through the transparent pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> to provide another reference point. The arrangement where the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> provides cutting alignment guidance in the closed position (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) may be particularly useful when the cutting tool needs to be moved forward as close as possible to a vertical element that might impede further cutting (such as into a corner). According to an advantageous feature of the invention, in the event the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> is hit or jarred when in its open position, since it is rotatably attached and is urged with the camming arrangement <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>315</bold></highlight> between the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> and the base <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the pointer element <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> will simply flip back to the closed position, instead of getting damaged or broken. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Another similar embodiment of the invention is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> and provides a line-of-cut indicator <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a pointer element <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> rotatably attached to a base <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> that is secured to a footplate <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> at a desired lateral position with a screw <highlight><bold>490</bold></highlight> extending through a slot <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> in the base <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. The pointer element <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> has an upper edge <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> and a bottom edge <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight>, as well as a first side arm <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight> and a second side arm <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> has a raised hollow portion <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> that is secured between the first and second side arms <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> of the pointer element <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>. The first side arm <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, raised hollow portion <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> and second side arm <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> have an opening therethrough for receiving an axis pin <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> that rotatably attaches the first and second side pieces <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> to the base <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the axis pin <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> includes an eccentric cam section <highlight><bold>466</bold></highlight> that interacts with a leaf spring <highlight><bold>467</bold></highlight> attached to the base <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> and which actuates normal to the pin axis to urge the pointer element <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> between either an open position or a closed position. The axis pin <highlight><bold>465</bold></highlight> extends in a generally transverse direction and, is secured to the pointer frame <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> in side arms <highlight><bold>450</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight>. The base <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> has a rectangular-shaped aperture <highlight><bold>495</bold></highlight>, generally the same size as the pointer element <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, for receiving the pointer element <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> in the closed position. The pointer element <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> may be solid and may be fabricated of a transparent plastic material, although other materials known in the art may be used. Guide marks <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> are provided on both the upper edge <highlight><bold>425</bold></highlight> and the lower edge <highlight><bold>435</bold></highlight> of the pointer element <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, as well as the base <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As seen from the foregoing, the present invention provides several embodiments of a line-of-cut indicator assembly for a cutting tool. Advantageous for each embodiment is that the assembly extends beyond the front edge of the cutting tool and provides at least two points of reference for guiding and aligning the tool during a cutting operation. Further, features are disclosed for urging the indicator assembly between either an open position or a closed position. In addition, features are disclosed for providing a camming action for the indicator assembly such that if the assembly is jarred or hit while in an open position, the assembly will return to a closed position, thereby reducing the risk that the assembly will be broken or damaged. </paragraph>
