<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to storage systems and, more specifically to storage systems used in surface mount manufacturing environments to increase floor space utilization. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Surface mount placement machines are well known in the art and are generally classified as either a gantry or turret style machine based on the design of the pick and place system. Gantry systems are generally constructed with a robot head mounted to one of two independent axes, the axes linearly translate to allow the head to pick up and place an individual surface mount component on a printed circuit board. Typically gantry style machines are used in low volume manufacturing applications to place odd shape or delicate surface mount components, examples of such components are ball grid arrays (BGAs) or fine-pitch quad flat packs (QFPs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A turret style machine, often referred to as a chipshooter, is designed to place simple surface mount components on a printed circuit board in high volume manufacturing applications. Chipshooters are highly automated and are intended to operate with a minimum of operator intervention. Ideally, operator intervention is required only to insure that the chipshooter is supplied with raw materials, such as unfinished printed circuit boards and component reels loaded with individual surface mount devices like small outline integrated circuits (SOIC), resistors, capacitors, etc. To insure continuous operation of the chipshooters and to minimize production losses related to machine downtime, it is essential that raw materials be readily available. As a result, raw materials are generally stored as near to the chipshooters as possible. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A number of storage systems are presently utilized with chipshooters, each with varying degrees of success. For example, one known storage system uses a reinforced rectangular plastic bin constructed of a rigid plastic material. These bins are designed to interlock when vertically stacked and are sealable to protect their contents from moisture and other contaminants. The interior of these bins are featureless to maximize the quantity of surface mount component reels that can be stored within the bins. Normally, individual storage bins are preconfigured offline and loaded with the component reels and other raw materials necessary to manufacture a particular production lot, the configured storage bins are then transported to the appropriate production line prior to a product changeover. During the product changeover, the component reels are mounted on feeder cartridges, and the feeder cartridges, in turn, are installed in the proper position on a feeder bank associated with either the chipshooter or the gantry style machine. Excess bins containing spare component reels are stacked and are stored in accessible locations near the production line, an example of a typical location is the floor space in or around the aisle surrounding the chipshooter. When the surface mount placement machine uses all of the individual components on a component reel, the component reel can be replenished from a nearby bin in an attempt to minimize the equipment downtime. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Storage systems such as this have a number of flaws. For example, a single fully loaded bin is extremely heavy and is difficult for many operators to organize and transport. Moreover, a large amount of floor space is needed to store and organize spare and empty bins, floor space that could otherwise be converted into productive manufacturing space. Finally, the high initial and incremental costs associated with purchasing, replacing and maintaining enough bins to supply an entire manufacturing facility makes this system undesirable for many manufacturing applications. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To address these problems, some manufacturing facilities have begun to use a storage system modeled on portable industrial shelving to store and transport component reels. Industrial shelving storage systems are essentially wire storage racks mounted on rollers allowing them to be moved quickly and easily. Like the above described bins, this industrial shelving storage system can be preconfigured and loaded at an offline location and then positioned at a desired location near the production lines when needed. Using this storage system, a single individual can easily move all of the components needed to configure and supply an entire production line. By comparison to the multiple bin storage system described above, the industrial shelving storage system provides an efficient and cost-effective method of transporting and supplying raw materials to a production line. However, this system still requires a great deal of floor space to maneuver the racks into position around the production line and to store the racks when they are not in use. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> A storage system is disclosed that better utilizes manufacturing storage space than some known storage systems, to enable a person to store and organize the large number of, for example, surface mount component reels, needed to supply a surface mount placement machine, such as a chipshooter or gantry style machine. This system enables a user to preconfigure storage trays in an offline location and then rapidly exchange them during a product changeover to reduce the total machine downtime. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> One embodiment of a storage system includes a storage platform located directly above the feeder carriage of a surface mount placement machine. By positioning the storage platform directly above the surface mount placement machine the contents of the storage platform are directly accessible to an operator standing near the machine, either manually or using a mechanical lift modified to support the contents of the storage platform. The storage platform is attached to a vertical support member which is fixedly attached to, for example, the floor and is disposed adjacent to the feeder carriage, so that the storage platform is disposed within the footprint of the surface mount placement machine. The storage platform is adapted to accept a storage tray designed to allow component reels to be stored above the feeder carriage. Individual surface mount components reels are organized within the storage tray in the same sequence in which they will be utilized by the surface mount placement machine, the replacement component reels are readily accessible and well-organized, as a result component reel replacement times may be reduced. In an alternate embodiment, the storage platform is slightly inclined relative to a feeder bank disposed within the feeder carriage to allow automatic presentation of component reels when the storage tray is disposed upon the storage platform. In yet another embodiment, the storage tray is removably disposed relative to the storage platform allowing for rapid exchange of storage trays.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a chipshooter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a storage system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> disposed adjacent to the chipshooter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the chipshooter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is generally constructed with a tall, square main machine base <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> containing a turret (not shown) with a plurality of vacuum heads <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, illustrated in detail in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>, attached to its circumference. The main machine base <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is, in turn, attached to a low, rectangular housing called a feeder carriage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, at the midpoint thereof. A feeder base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes numerous positions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on which to mount a component feeder cartridge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and is capable of translating laterally via a servo motor positioning system. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a single component feeder cartridge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> loaded with a component reel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> containing, as best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, individual surface mount devices <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> supported in pockets <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> formed into a thin strip of paper or embossed plastic tape <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In operation the feeder base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> translates laterally to position a component feeder cartridge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and associated component reel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> assembly beneath the vacuum head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. The vacuum head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> then translates vertically, relative to the feeder base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a vacuum nozzle <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> extracts a single surface mount device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> from the tape pocket <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the component reel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Simultaneously, a feed mechanism, not shown, engages a feed lever <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> mechanism of the feeder cartridge <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to index the component reel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> forward to expose the next surface mount device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for pickup. Upon completion of these operations, the vacuum head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is transferred to the next station around the circumference of the turret, and the pickup sequence is repeated. Eventually the first component is transferred to the front of the turret and is suspended above the unfinished printed circuit board. At this point, the vacuum head <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> again shifts vertically, relative to the feeder base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and to the printed circuit board, and the vacuum pressure is disengaged as the surface mount device <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> comes into contact with the top surface of the printed circuit board. This placement sequence is repeated until the unfinished printed circuit board is populated with the preprogrammed number and type of surface mount devices <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Referring again to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the storage system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is intended to take advantage of the unutilized space above the feeder carriage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to provide storage for surface mount device component reels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> that are used to supply the feeder cartridges <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> secured on the feeder base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The unutilized space exploited by the storage system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is created in part by the differences in heights and shapes between the main machine base <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the feeder carriage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</cross-reference>, the storage system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a vertical support structure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which is securely attached to the floor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> via a number of attachment members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and is positioned adjacent to the feeder carriage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. If desired, it is possible to adapt the attachment members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to be received within a cavity, not shown, prepared in the floor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. The vertical support structure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> may be reinforced by a plurality of brace members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> if so desired. A number of structural members forming a shelf <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> that may be cantilevered over the top of the feeder carriage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> are attached to the top of the vertical support structure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the shelf <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> and vertical support structure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are designed to support a storage tray <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> within the footprint defined by the floorspace occupied by the main machine base <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and the feeder carriage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the chipshooter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The storage tray <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may be configured with a plurality of storage slots <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that support and organize component reels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Thus, the storage system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has the shelf <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> cantilevered over the feeder carriage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> wherein the shelf <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is supported by a plurality of vertical support structures <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and may be reinforced by a plurality of brace members <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the storage tray <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, having a plurality of storage slots <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, is removably disposed relative to the shelf <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> to allow for quick removal and replacement of the storage tray <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> during a production changeover. A commercially available lift, not shown, can be used to extract the entire storage tray <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> and replace it with a preconfigured storage tray <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> that corresponds to the feeder cartridge setup on the feeder base <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for the new production run. This ability to preconfigure storage trays <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> offline minimizes the time needed for a production changeover and increases the speed at which the chipshooter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be returned to continuous production. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the vertical support structure <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> supports an inclined shelf <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> which, in turn, supports an elongated storage tray <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The elongated storage tray <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> contains a plurality of elongated storage slots <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, each of which is capable of accepting multiple component reels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The storage system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> uses gravity feed for automatically presenting replacement component reels to the operator. The gravity feed operates by storing multiple component reels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in each elongated storage slot <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, and when a component reel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is removed from the presentation position <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, a replacement reel in the storage position <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> automatically translates down the inclined slope of the elongated storage tray <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, to the presentation position <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7, a</cross-reference> support structure <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> including a plurality of vertical support members <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and a plurality of attachment members <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are adapted to mount directly to an upper surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the feeder carriage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The support structure <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, in turn, supports a shelf <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> directly above the upper surface <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> of the feeder carriage. The shelf <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> and the support structure <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are located entirely within the footprint of the feeder carriage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The shelf <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is adapted to support a storage tray <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the storage tray <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having a plurality of slots <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> intended to vertically store surface mount component reels <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Installation of the shelf <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> on a chipshooter <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may require modifications to the feeder carriage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> to insure structural stability of the combined feeder carriage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and storage system unit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the vertical support members <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> are adapted to cooperate with a horizontal support member <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The horizontal support member <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> allows the storage system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to be mounted directly to a vertical side <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the feeder carriage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, illustrated for clarity in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, using attachment plates <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. The attachment plates <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> include a plurality of holes <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> for mounting to the vertical sides <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of the feeder carriage <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, and the embodiment illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the surface mount placement machine can be relocated without having to remove the attachment members <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from the floor <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and remount the storage system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> at the desired location, which reduces the amount of time and effort needed to relocate a surface mount placement machine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each of the plurality of storage slots in the storage tray <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> may have a unique identifier <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, each unique identifier <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> corresponding to a single position <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> on the feeder base <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. This identification system allows the operator to double-check and insure that the proper component reel <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is placed in the proper position <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> While the storage system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has been described herein with references relating directly to turret style machines, these examples are intended to be illustrative only and not to be limiting of the invention. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the storage system <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be adapted to utilized the space directly above other types of surface mount placement machines such as the aforementioned gantry style machines without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
