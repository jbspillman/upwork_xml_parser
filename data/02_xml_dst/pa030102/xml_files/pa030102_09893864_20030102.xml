<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Side sprays are conventionally mounted on a sink deck adjacent to the spout nipple and the faucet volume and temperature control handles, if those are not directly mounted with the spout nipple as in a single lever faucet. The spray is attached to a hose and it is pulled out from the deck and used to direct a spray discharge to the interior of the sink. At times, a homeowner will desire to change the plumbing fixtures which are mounted on the sink deck and this may include not only the spout, but also the control handles. The assignee of the present application, Moen Incorporated, has developed a suite of products, marketed under the trademark M-PACT, which enables the consumer to change the exterior of the products associated with the sink deck, all from above the sink deck and without the necessity of work being performed underneath the deck. The present invention, a side spray, is directed toward the same end and permits the replacement of the side spray from above the sink deck without resort to disconnecting the hose from beneath the deck. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the principal components of the side spray are indicated to include a spray body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and a coil spring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which biases the valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to a normally closed position. An O-ring <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> extends about the exterior of and seals to a quick connect adapter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The adapter will receive one end of a water tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having shoulder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which is one of the elements which connects the hose to the side spray. The tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected to a hose <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> by means of a crimped connector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. A housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> completes the principal components of the side spray which connect it to the hose <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Focusing particularly on <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the spray body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> has a plurality of spray openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which communicate with a chamber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> which is a part of a water path through the spray body. The valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a head <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which extends through an opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the spray body, with the opening <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> being closed by a tapered shoulder <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> on the valve, carrying an O-ring <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, with the O-ring bearing against a tapered wall <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of the passage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The passage <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and the chamber <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> form a part of the water path to the spray openings, which path is normally closed by the valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> as it is biased to the closed position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> by the spring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is operated by a trigger <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> mounted on the side spray body and having a projection <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which is effective to move the valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> away from the closed position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> when the trigger <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> is pressed inwardly on the spray body. The above-described construction is conventional in side sprays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The quick connect adapter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has an annular groove <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> to receive the O-ring <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> which seals between the adapter and the spray body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Directly below the groove <highlight><bold>47</bold></highlight> there are outwardly-extending projections <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> which will rest upon an internal shoulder <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in the housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to support the quick connect adapter within the housing. The housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> is secured to the spray body <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by means of a threaded connection <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. The quick connect adapter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has an internal chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and a pair of upstanding arcuate fingers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The fingers <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> terminate in a shoulder <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> which together with the fingers forms a socket to support the valve shaft <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as particularly shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. The spring <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> will bottom on a flange <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> on the exterior of the connector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and is in contact with the underside of a flange <highlight><bold>65</bold></highlight> on the valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> carries the described shoulder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which in the connected position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is held against a tapered shoulder <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> formed at the base of the connector chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. An O-ring <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> is located within the chamber <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> of the connector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in a groove <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and this O-ring will extend about the tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when the tube is fully inserted into the connector. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The connector includes a spring clip <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> having a pair of arms <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> connected together by a body portion <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</cross-reference>. The spring clip is positioned within a chamber <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> of the connector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and is movable back and forth within that chamber to effect an interlock with the tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and its shoulder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. There is a further portion <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> of the clip <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which bears directly against the tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in the fully connected position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The bottom flange <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> of the connector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is supported on a series of spaced ribs <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> formed on the inside of housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> To disassemble the side spray, the first step is to unthread the spray body from the housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The adapter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> may then be pulled out to provide access to the clip <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> which may be pushed outward from the chamber <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to release the tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and its shoulder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from the interior of the adapter. The housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> may then be removed from the hose. To replace the housing and the spray body with new components of a similar mechanical configuration and function, the tube <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may be passed through the housing and re-inserted into the adapter, after the clip <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> has been pushed outward from the chamber <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to permit such insertion. The clip is then pushed in, locking the tube within the adapter <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, as the shoulder <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> will bear against the tapered surface <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and the clip will hold it in this position. The spray body and the associated trigger mechanism may then be threadedly attached to the housing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the side spray is ready for use. All of the above steps are done from above the sink deck without resort to the area beneath the deck. The hose and its associated tube, which are held together by the connector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, are easily removed from the connector <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> by manipulation of the clip <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Whereas the preferred form of the invention has been shown and described herein, it should be realized that there may be many modifications, substitutions and alterations thereto. </paragraph>
