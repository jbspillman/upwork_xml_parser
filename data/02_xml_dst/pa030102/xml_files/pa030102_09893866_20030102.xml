<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> This invention generally relates to liquid crystal display (LCD) and integrated circuit (IC) fabrication and, more particularly, to a method for forming a crystallized silicon film with trace impurities for use in the polycrystalline thin film transistors (TFTs) of Active Matrix (AM) LCDs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Silicon films enriched with a small amount of nickel (Ni) can be annealed more quickly by solid-phase-crystallization than pure-Si films. This is due to the catalytic action (as far as crystallization), afforded by the formation of a silicide between the silicon (Si) and Ni atoms. To introduce the Ni impurity into the silicon films, several approaches have been implemented. In one conventional approach, a silicon film is initially deposited by conventional means and, after deposition, is coated with a Ni-rich liquid solution. After coating, the film with the Ni-rich coating is heated at temperatures suitable for the formation of Si&mdash;Ni silicide. Then, the remaining solution is removed from the surface, the surface is cleaned, and the thin Si-film is crystallized by an appropriate annealing step, such as furnace annealing or rapid thermal annealing (RTP). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In another conventional approach, a very thin layer of Ni is evaporated on a Si film that is initially deposited by conventional methods. Subsequent steps are similar to the above-mentioned case. In yet another approach, Ni is implanted into a silicon film that is initially deposited by conventional means. After implantation, the film is initially annealed at low temperature to form silicide, followed by higher temperature anneal to completely crystallize the silicon layer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is obvious that the first two conventional approaches mentioned above require additional steps to introduce Ni into the silicon film, and to subsequently remove the excess Ni from the surface of the silicon layer. In a large-scale factory implantation, the process costs of these &ldquo;extra&rdquo; steps can be quite high. Furthermore, the process typically introduces damage into the silicon film, making the film more difficult to crystallize. The opposite effect from what is desired. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It would be advantageous if impurities, such as Ni, could be introduced into a silicon film with a fewer number of process steps. It would be advantageous if the reduced-step impurity introduction process could be performed at low temperatures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It would be desirable to develop an easier and faster silicide process that reduces the risk of damage to the silicon film being crystallized. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention permits the introduction of controlled amounts of Ni, or other transistion metal, during the deposition of a silicon film. This invention uses a sputtering process to deposit the silicon film from a target that is partially doped with Ni atoms. In this manner, Ni-doping occurs simultaneously with the deposition of the Si film, and no extra steps are required to add the Ni impurities into the silicon film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a method is provided for forming silicon films with a controlled amount of trace impurities. The method comprises: forming a target including silicon and a first concentration of a first impurity; supplying a substrate; and, sputter depositing a film of silicon on the substrate including a second concentration of the first impurity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Forming a target including silicon and a first concentration of a first impurity includes using a first impurity selected from the group including transistion metals, phosphorous, and germanium. When the first impurity is Ni, the first concentration of nickel in the target is in the range of 0.01 to 0.5 percentage by atomic weight (at %). Preferably the range is 0.05 to 0.2 at %. Then, the second concentration of Ni in the depositing a silicon film is in the range of 0.01 to 0.5 at %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> When the first impurity is germanium, the first concentration of germanium in the target is in the range of 5 to 30 at %, and the second concentration of germanium in the deposited silicon film is in the range of 5 to 30 at %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Phosphorous can be added as an additional impurity, with either nickel or germanium. The concentration of phosphorous in the target is less than 5&times;e<highlight><superscript>17 </superscript></highlight>atomic weight per cubic centimeter (at/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>). As a result, the concentration of phosphorous in the deposited silicon film is sufficient to create a Vth shift. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Following the formation of the silicon film with the second concentration of a transistion metal, the method comprises: annealing the silicon film including the first impurity to form a silicide; and, annealing the silicon film with the silicide to crystallize the silicon film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Additional details of the above-described method, and alternate methods of the present invention are presented below.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As noted in U.S. Pat. No. 6,149,784 (Su et al.), sputtering, or physical vapor deposition (PVD), is the favored technique for depositing materials, particularly metals and metal-based materials, in the fabrication of semiconductor integrated circuits. Sputtering has a high deposition rate and, in most cases, uses relatively simple and inexpensive fabrication equipment and relatively inexpensive material precursors, targets in the case of PVD. The usual type of sputtering used in commercial applications is DC magnetron sputtering, which is limited to the sputtering of metallic target. Sputtering is widely used for the deposition of aluminum (Al) to form metallization levels in semiconductor liquid crystal displays. More recently, copper deposition by PVD has been developed. However, sputtering is applicable to a wider range of materials useful in the fabrication of semiconductor integrated circuits. Reactive sputtering is well known in which a target of a metal, such as titanium or tantalum, is sputtered in the presence of a reactive gas in the plasma, most typically nitrogen. Thereby, the sputtered metal atoms react with the reactive gas to deposit a metal compound on the wafer, most particularly, a metal nitride, such as titanium nitride using a titanium target in a nitrogen ambient or tantalum nitride using a tantalum target in a nitrogen ambient. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a schematic block diagram, partial cross-section of a DC sputtering chamber, or reactor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> (prior art). The reactor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is vacuum-sealed and has a target or cathode <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Typically, the target <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is a metal, but semiconductor and insulator materials can also be used. The target material is sputtered onto a substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> to form a film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>. The substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> is held on a heater pedestal electrode <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> or an electrostatic chuck. An anode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> acts as a dark space shield to protect the chamber wall <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> from the sputtered material and provides a return path or collection surface for the electrons emitted from the cathode target <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A controllable pulsed DC power supply (not shown) negatively biases the target <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> with respect to the anode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. Conventionally, the pedestal <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> and substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are left electrically floating, but a DC self-bias can be used to attract positively charged ions from the plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Gas enters the reactor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> from an inlet port <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight>, and gas exits through an exhaust port <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. The sputtering gas is often argon. The gas flow is regulated to maintain interior of the reactor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> at a low pressure. The conventional pressure of the argon working gas is typically maintained at between about 1 and 1000 mTorr. When the argon is admitted into the reactor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the DC voltage applied between the target <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and the anode <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> ignites the argon into a plasma, and the positively charged argon ions are attracted to the negatively charged target <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The ions strike the target <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> at a substantial energy and cause target atoms or atomic clusters to be sputtered from the target <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Some of the target particles strike the substrate <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and are thereby deposited on it, thereby forming the film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> of the target material. Alternately, the target material reacts with gas added to the argon to form a composite film including target material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> To provide efficient sputtering, opposing magnets <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> produce a magnetic field within the reactor <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in the neighborhood of the magnets <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The magnetic field traps electrons and, for charge neutrality, the ion density also increases to form a high-density plasma region <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> within the reactor adjacent to the target <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Plasma ignition can present a significant problem, especially in the geometries representative of a commercially significant plasma reactor. The initial excitation of a plasma requires a high voltage, though with essentially no current, to cause the working gas to be excited into the electrons and positive ions of an electron. This condition must persist for a time period and over a space sufficient to support a low-resistance, essentially neutral plasma between the two electrodes in the case of a capacitively coupled plasma. The maintenance of a plasma requires a feedback condition in which argon atoms must supply as many electrons to the anode as ions to target. If the flow of electrons to the anode is insufficient, the plasma collapses or is never formed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Pulsed DC sputtering, therefore, provides a method for the low temperature (less than 2000 degrees C.) deposition of oxide and silicon films. Low temperature processing is a critical when films are deposited on plastic substrates, such as the substrates used in the fabrication of flexible liquid crystal displays (LCDs). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> With respect to the present invention, the target <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is a single-crystal material with an embedded first impurity. The first impurity can be a transistion metal, such as Ni. Other first impurity materials are phosphorous or germanium. The film <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> is an amorphous silicon film with the first impurity of the target <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. The sputtering process deposits the first impurity as well as the silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Although a pulsed DC sputtering tool <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, equivalent results can be achieved using a standard, or non-pulsed DC-sputtering apparatus. The selection of the specific sputtering apparatus is dependent upon the resistivity of the Ni-doped Si target. For many applications, the pulsed-DC method is favored due to its better stability characteristics when sputtering relatively resistive materials (such as Si). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The Ni-doping level in the silicon target depends upon the Ni-doping requirement in the as-sputtered Si film. For effective silicide-assisted crystallization, a Ni concentration of 0.01 at % to 0.5 at % (atomic weight %) is required in the silicon film. This implies that this concentration range of Ni in the Si target should be in a similar range. However, there are differences in the sputtering yield between Ni and Si atoms. Ni has a 2-3 times higher yield than Si. Therefore, it may be concluded that a lower concentration range of Ni in the Si target yields the required concentration range in the sputtered film. The concentration range of Ni in the silicon target is then in the range of 0.05 at % to 0.2 at %. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a comparison illustrating the number of steps saved in the present invention process of fabricating a silicon film with a controlled amount of impurities. Although there is not an exact correspondence between the steps of the present invention and conventional processes, it can be seen that the present invention process does not require the step and removing excess Ni. As noted in the Background Section above, the performance of this step in prior art processes often leads to damage in the silicon film that is detrimental to crystallization. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> The silicon target can be doped with other materials besides transistion metals. For example, the Si target can be doped with germanium (Ge). Germanium enhances the crystallization of Si in subsequent annealing steps. The formation of a SiGe film yields better crystalline quality. It is easier to crystallize poly-Si films when the Ge concentration in the film is in the range of 5-30 at %. This implies similar concentration in the Si-Ge target material, since the yield for sputtering Ge is approximately the same as the yield for silicon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Further, the Si target can be doped with P (phosphorous), in additional to doping the target with Ni or Ge. The P addition, permits the formation of lightly p-type poly-Si film. This light doping is beneficial for threshold voltage adjustment of thin film transistors (TFTs) fabricated from such poly-Si films. The level of P doping is determined based upon the magnitude of the Vth shift. Generally, the P concentration in the Si(Ni) or Si(Ge) target should be less than 5e17at/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>, or less than 10 ppm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a flowchart illustrating the present invention method for forming silicon films with a controlled amount of trace impurities in the fabrication of LCDs. Although the method, and the method described by <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> below, is depicted as a sequence of numbered steps for clarity, no order should be inferred from the numbering unless explicitly stated. The method starts at Step <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>. Step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> forms a target including silicon and a first concentration of a first impurity. Typically, a single-crystal silicon target is formed. Step <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> supplies a substrate. Step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> sputter deposits a film of silicon on the substrate including a second concentration of the first impurity. Typically, a film of amorphous silicon is formed. Sputter depositing a film of silicon on the substrate including a second concentration of the first impurity in Step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> includes sputter depositing using a process selected from the group including pulsed and non-pulsed direct current (DC) sputtering. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Forming a target including silicon and a first concentration of a first impurity in Step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> includes forming a target with a first impurity selected from the group including transistion metals, phosphorous, and germanium. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In some aspects of the invention, the first impurity is the transistion metal nickel. Then, forming a target including silicon and a first concentration of a first impurity in Step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> includes forming a target with a first concentration of nickel in the range of 0.01 to 0.5 percentage by atomic weight (at %). Sputter depositing a film of silicon on the substrate including a second concentration of the first impurity in Step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> includes depositing a silicon film including a second concentration of nickel in the range of 0.01 to 0.5 at %. However, because of the differences in yield between Si and Ni, Step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> preferably forms a target with a first concentration of nickel in the range of 0.05 to 0.2 percentage by atomic weight (at %), while Step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> deposits a silicon film including a second concentration of nickel in the range of 0.01 to 0.5 at %. </paragraph>

Sputter depositing a film of silicon on the substrate including a second concentration of nickel in Step <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> includes depositing a silicon film with an additional fourth concentration of phosphorous sufficient to create a first Vth shift in the silicon film. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In some aspects, the method includes further steps. Step <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight> anneals the silicon film including the first impurity of nickel to form a silicide.
