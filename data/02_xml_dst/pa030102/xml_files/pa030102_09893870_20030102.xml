<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Data processing systems, such as microprocessors, may include a circuit designed to distribute a reference signal called a clock to synchronize the processing of data. The clock may be distributed to multiple elements acting as receivers in the data processing systems. The closer the sequential elements are to receiving the clock at the same time, the faster the data processing systems can be. Delay elements may compensate the undesired delay variations experienced by the clock when the clock travels toward the receivers, thereby increasing the system speed.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Variable-delay Element Circuit Topology </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the various exemplary embodiments of the present invention, digitally adjustable resistors are used to construct the variable-delay element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> shows an exemplary embodiment of the general circuit topology of the variable-delay element of the present invention. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the variable delay element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may consist of an inverter <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and a pull-down stack using a plurality of transistors <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> provided in a transistor array to construct a digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the pull-down stack uses a transistor array in which a plurality of columns and a plurality of rows are allowed. Each bit of the control signal b&lsqb;n-1:0&rsqb; is connected to the gate of one transistor (e.g., <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>) in the transistor array <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It should be appreciated that all of the control bits for a particular row in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> cannot be simultaneously zero to guarantee that the output can switch. In these embodiments, every control bit combination that blocks the pull-down stack is considered illegal. The resistance of the pull-down stack is minimal when all of the transistors of the array are conducting. The maximum resistance is achieved when, for each row, only the smallest transistor conducts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the various exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a variable-delay element functions logically equivalent to an inverter in which the delay is varied in accordance with the variance in resistance of the digitally adjustable resistor. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a function of the exemplary variable-delay element of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an input signal x is input to the variable-delay element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and output signal y is output from the variable-delay element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, an n-bit control signal sets the variable delay d between the rising input transition and the falling output transition. As the input signal x is input to the variable-delay element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the signal is inverted by the inverter <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> and with respect to the rising input transition, the falling output transition of the signal is delayed by a variable delay d by the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The inverted delayed output signal y is then output from the variable-delay element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> In accordance with these various embodiments, of the present invention, the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> forming the variable-delay element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> in the exemplary embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may be controlled with a considerably high resolution and over a wide range. In particular, by varying the sizes of the transistors <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> in the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, or varying the control bit combinations for the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the variable delay d of the variable-delay element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> constructed by the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is controlled. That is, the transistor sizes and the control bit combinations may be varied to vary the resistance of the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Thus, by increasing the resistance of the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the variable delay d of the variable-delay element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be increased. Similarly, by decreasing the resistance of the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the variable delay d of the variable-delay element <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be decreased. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Selecting the Transistor Size </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> In various exemplary embodiments, the width constraint of binary-weighted transistors of a digitally adjustable resistor is removed. For example, in the exemplary embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the widths of the transistors <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> forming the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> are not restricted to be 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. times bigger than the smallest transistor width. In particular, the widths of the transistors <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> are randomly selected to obtain a good distribution of resistance values for the transistors <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> In accordance with these various exemplary embodiments, the widths of the transistors <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> in the exemplary embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> are randomly selected which produce a set of resistance value for the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. A resistance label L is assigned to each combination of control bits b&lsqb;n-1:0&rsqb; that can be legally applied to the transistor array <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, the resistance label L being an integer. Each set of control bits determines which of the transistors <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> are ON and which are OFF. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In these exemplary embodiments, a desired resistance transfer function R(L) for the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> and the maximum acceptable resistance deviation, Rdelta_desired, for the function are selected. The desired resistance transfer function R(L) includes a maximum value, Rmax_desired, and a minimum value, Rmin_desired. For each legal control bit combination L, the resistance of the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is determined, and the achievable resistances are then sorted in increasing order of resistance value. The randomly selected transistor widths are kept if the desired resistance transfer function R(L) is realizable with the minimum achievable resistance value Rmin and the maximum achievable resistance value Rmax of the sorted achievable resistances, and the maximum difference between two consecutive resistance values of the achievable resistances Rdelta. The desired resistance transfer function R(L) is realizable if 1) the minimum achievable resistance Rmin is less than the minimum value of the function Rmin desired; 2) the maximum achievable resistance Rmax is greater than the maximum value of the function Rmax_desired; and 3) the maximum difference between two consecutive resistance values Rdelta is less than the maximum acceptable resistance deviation Rdelta_desired. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">Selecting Control Bit Combinations </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In accordance with other various exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a compact variable-delay element is constructed that does not require an output multiplexer, where multiple transistor rows and multiple transistor columns are provided in the digitally adjustable resistor. In various exemplary embodiments, limitations on the number of transistor rows are removed by, instead, determining appropriate values for the digital signal controlling the digitally adjustable resistor. By, for example, selecting legal control bit combinations, the appropriate values for the digital signal are determined. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In one exemplary embodiment for selecting the control bit combinations for the variable-delay element of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, for example, the resistance label L is assigned to each combination of control bits b&lsqb;n-1:0&rsqb; that can be legally applied to the transistor array <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The control bits are selected which produce a desired resistance value. Each set of control bits determines which of the transistors <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> are ON and which are OFF. In other words, each set of control bits defines a particular combination of transistors in parallel and in series. The control bit combinations can be selected under nominal conditions and under conditions subjected to random variations in the transistor array <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> A. Nominal Conditions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In accordance with various exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the range of resistances for all of the legal bit combinations are determined. A desired pull-down resistance R(L) between the minimum value Rmin of the range and the maximum value Rmax of the range is closely approximated to be an approximated pull-down resistance Rapprox(L). In these exemplary embodiments, the control bits associated with the resistance label L are selected such that the absolute value of the difference between the approximated pull-down resistance and the desired pull-down resistance &verbar; Rapprox(L)&minus;R(L)&verbar; is minimized. That is, the control bit combinations are selected such that the approximation error is minimized, and the approximated pull-down resistance Rapprox(L) is the closest obtainable value to the desired pull-down resistance R(L). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Because the desired pull-down resistances R(L) are arbitrary, the desired pull-down resistances R(L) can follow the points of any linear or non-linear function of L. However, the function followed by R(L) must be bounded by the minimum value Rmin and the maximum value Rmax of the range of resistances of all legal control bit combinations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> B. Random Variation Conditions </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> When a digitally adjustable resistor is subjected to random variations, the resistance corresponding to a particular control bit combination varies randomly from its nominal value. However, some control bit combinations are more stable than others. That is, the resistance may vary with the variance in channel length. For example, if the channel length of every transistor is varied randomly, the resistance corresponding to the combination label LO may deviate from its nominal value by 2%. The resistance corresponding to LI, another control bit combination, may change by 5%. In such case, the resistance associated with the combination label L<highlight><bold>0</bold></highlight> is more stable than that associated with the combination label L<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In accordance with various exemplary embodiments of the present invention, under random variation conditions, the control bits applied to the digitally adjustable resistor are selected based on the premise that some combinations are more stable than others. With L as the label of a particular set of control bits and the range of resistance values corresponding to the combination label L being defined by an approximated minimum value Rminapprox(L) and an approximated maximum value Rmaxapprox(L) of a control bit combination when the digitally adjustable resistor is random perturbed, in accordance with these embodiments, the control bit combination to approximate a desired pull-down resistance R(L) between Rmin and Rmax of the control bit combination minimizes:</paragraph>
<paragraph lvl="0"><in-line-formula>Max(&verbar;Rminapprox(L)&minus;R(L)&verbar;,&verbar;Rmaxapprox(L)&minus;R(L)&verbar;)</in-line-formula></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Thus, in accordance with these embodiments, the control bit combination is selected by minimizing the maximum of two quantities: the distance between the approximated minimum value Rminapprox(L) and R(L), and the distance between the approximated maximum value Rmaxpprox(L) and R(L). That is, in these embodiments, the control bit combination selected is the combination that minimizes the worst-case resistance deviation from the desired value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows one exemplary embodiment of the present invention in which a digitally adjustable resistor is followed by an inverter. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the variable-delay element <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> may include a digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, followed by an inverter <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the input to the variable-delay element <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is x. The output of the variable-delay element <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> is y, and the output of the inverter <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is z. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> The inverter <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> helps to protect the output of the variable-delay element <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. The variable-delay element <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> adjusts the rising edge of the output z of the inverter <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> in small linear steps, while the resistance of the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is not linear. That is, there is a non-linear relationship between the resistance of the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and the delay of the variable-delay element <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, in order to obtain linear delay steps, non-linear resistance values are selected. In fact, by purposely choosing non-linear steps for the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, second-order delay variations due to the inverter <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> may be compensated. In particular, the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> may be used to compensate the variable shape and transition time of the output y from the variable-delay element <highlight><bold>400</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Since the falling edge of the output y from the digitally adjustable resistor <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> adjustable, the rising edge of the output z from the inverter <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> is also adjustable. In one exemplary embodiment, <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> possible control bit combinations are provided, with <highlight><bold>225</bold></highlight> legal combinations and <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> illegal combinations. In this exemplary embodiment, by choosing <highlight><bold>51</bold></highlight> of the legal combinations, the rising edge of the output z from the inverter <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> can be varied in 1-ps steps over a 50-ps range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows exemplary simulated waveforms associated with each control bit combination. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the transition time, i.e., the time required to go from 20% to 80% of the maximum voltage, of the rising edge is nearly constant. That is, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, to go from 0.26V (20% of the maximum voltage 1.3V) to 1.04V (80% of the maximum voltage 1.3V), the delay range is around 50 ps, which is nearly constant. The falling edge is practically not disturbed by the variable resistance of the pull-down stack. When the rising edge moves, the position of the falling edge remains within 0.5 ps of its average value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> As shown in the above exemplary embodiments, the digitally adjustable resistor can be used to construct a variable-delay element, which in turn may be used in high-frequency microprocessor debugging, for example. In such instances, the variable-delay element may remain linear under various process, voltage and temperature conditions. For example, the variable-delay element&apos;s 1-ps resolution is sufficient for path-delay characterization. Since the variable-delay element is topologically similar to a static logic gate, its area and power dissipation may be relatively small. Moreover, the clock adjustment mechanism used for debugging in the clock distribution network may become reasonably robust against random channel length variations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Because of its high resolution, the digitally adjustable resistor can be used to compensate a wide variety of non-linear effects, by appropriately selecting desired control bit combinations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> is a flow chart of a method of selecting transistor widths of the present invention. Beginning at step <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>, control proceeds to step <highlight><bold>610</bold></highlight>, where each combination of control bits b&lsqb;n-1:0&rsqb; that can be legally applied to the transistor array is input. A resistance label L is assigned to each legal combination. Next, in step <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight>, the desired resistance transfer function R(L) is selected.

In addition, the minimum value of the desired resistance transfer function Rmin_desired and the maximum value of the resistance transfer function Rmax_desired is also selected. Then, in step <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>, transistor widths for the input control bit combination is selected. The transistor widths are selected randomly. Control then continues to step <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight> In step <highlight><bold>650</bold></highlight>, the resistance for each legal input control bit combination is determined. Next, in step <highlight><bold>660</bold></highlight>, the achievable resistance values are sorted in increasing order. Then, in step <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight>, it is determined as to whether or not the desired resistance transfer R(L) realizable based on the sorted achievable resistance values. The desired resistance transfer function R(L) is realizable if 1) the minimum achievable resistance Rmin of the sorted achievable resistance values is less than the minimum value of the function Rmin_desired; 2) the maximum achievable resistance Rmax of the sorted achievable resistance values is greater than the maximum value of the function Rmax_desired; and 3) the maximum difference Rdelta between two consecutive resistance values of the sorted achievable resistance values is less than the maximum acceptable resistance deviation Rdelta_desired. If desired resistance transfer function R(L) is not realizable, that is, if one of the three determining conditions in step <highlight><bold>670</bold></highlight> are not met, control returns to step <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight>. Otherwise, the desired resistance transfer function R(L) is realizable and control continues to step <highlight><bold>680</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

If &verbar;Rapprox(L)&minus;R(L)&verbar; for the input legal control bit combination is not the minimum, the desired pull-down resistance is not closely approximated by the input legal control bit, and thus control returns to step <highlight><bold>750</bold></highlight> for the input of the next combination.

That is, it should be appreciated that the present invention is not limited to an array of a pull-down stack. In accordance with various exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a transistor array may comprise an NFET array of a pull-down stack and a pFET array of a pull-up stack. </paragraph>
