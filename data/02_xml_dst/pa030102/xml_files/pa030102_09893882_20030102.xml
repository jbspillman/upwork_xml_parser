<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to slidable members and more particularly to a mechanism for the relative positioning of telescopic members mounted on highchairs, strollers, and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Length adjustment mechanisms for slidable members are well known. Such mechanisms are provided to fit different individuals with various heights, weights and job tasks. A plurality of applications can be found as detailed below: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 1. Retractable handle for luggage. It is advantageous if a user can pull the handle out to an appropriate length when in use, while retracting the handle to rest on the bezel when not is use for saving storage space. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 2. Retractable clothes hanger. This is adapted to the length of a specific place such as a balcony. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> 3. Highchair with adjustable seat height. This is advantageous when used in restaurants to fit toddlers. Alternatively, it can be retracted to a minimum storage space when not in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> 4. Stroller with adjustable length with respect to its handle or frame. It is advantageous to fit different individuals pushing the stroller. Furthermore, it is convenient to fold such strollers when not in use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Conventionally, length adjustment mechanisms are implemented in sliding members and support members wherein the sliding members are secured to the support members. Typically, there are two forms of adjustment. They are a single segment adjustment in which the sliding member is only allowed to secure to one of two positions with respect to the support member, and a multi-segment adjustment, wherein the sliding member is allowed to secure to any one of at least three positions with respect to the support member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The engagement between the sliding member and the support member is usually made possible by providing a plurality of holes and a cooperating depressible spring. The holes are made separately from the depressible spring. In a locked position, the sliding member and the support member are secured together when the spring moves into one of the holes. Alternatively, in an unlocked position the sliding member becomes disengaged from the support member when the spring clears the hole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> It is not easy to mount the spring in the narrow tube of the sliding member. Furthermore, a precise alignment between one hole and the spring is not easy. As such, the conventional hole and spring arrangment is expensive to implement and is time consuming, due to the complicated assembly of many components. </paragraph>

Thus, it is possible to adjust the height of seat <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> by utilizing the mechanism of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> illustrate the mechanism of the invention comprising a first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a second member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, an engagement member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, a connecting cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a trigger member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. Each of these elements is detailed below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is implemented as a base (in this embodiment) or a support tube. The first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is comprised of a receiving space <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and a plurality of notches <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> vertically disposed along its length. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The second member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is a tube that can slide within the receiving space <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a hole <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> in its wall. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Referring specifically to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the engagement member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is provided in the second member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The engagement member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is generally elongated to comprise a base <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight> shaped to secure the engagement member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the bottom of the second member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. An elongated sheetlike extension member <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> extends upward from the base <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>. A bent flexible member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is formed on top of the extension member <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>. A latched member <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is on top of the flexible member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The height of the latched member <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> (i.e., the total vertical length of the extension member <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and the flexible member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>) must be enough to make it flush with the hole <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. A pivot member <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight> is secured to the second member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a pin <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, and an actuation member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is adjacent the pivot member <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The connecting cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> has a bottom end secured to the actuation member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> and a top end secured to the trigger member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, which is provided on the outside of the second member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for ease of operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The following is a description of the operation of the mechanism: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>A, the latched member <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> of the engagement member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is passed through the hole <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the second member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to engage with one of the notches <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in a normal locked position. This is a desired position selected by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>B, the user presses the trigger member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to cause the connecting cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to move up, which in turn causes the actuation member <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> to pivot counterclockwise around the pivot member <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>. As such, the flexible member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight> is compressed to move inward, which in turn causes the latched member <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> of the engagement member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to move from the notch <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the hole <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the second member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, thus unlocking the second member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As a result, the second member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may slide into the receiving space <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> of the first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> until moved to a desired position. At this position, the latched member <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> of the engagement member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is again passed through the hole <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the second member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to engage with one of the notches <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> by the restored elastic force of the flexible member <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Note that the mechanism may be implemented in each bracket <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> of the swing of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. As a result, it is possible to adjust the height of seat <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> by utilizing this mechanism. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a second preferred embodiment of the mechanism according to the invention. The differences between the first and second preferred embodiments are described as follows. The connecting cable <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and trigger member <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> are eliminated. Also, the first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is implemented as a support tube. Furthermore, the notches <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the first embodiment are replaced by apertures <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in the second embodiment. The latched member <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> is projected above the aperture <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> in a normal locked position. To adjust the relative position of the second member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with respect to the first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, simply push the latched member <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> to cause it to move from the aperture <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> of the first member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the hole <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> of the second member <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The benefits of this invention, including the locking and unlocking of the first and second members <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, are carried out by utilizing a single engagement member <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, resulting in a reduction in the manufacturing cost and a simplified assembly process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims. </paragraph>

<claim-text>wherein the latched member is passed through the hole of the second member to engage with one of the apertures of the first tube in a locked position, and the actuation member is counterclockwise pivotable about the pivot member when actuated for causing the flexible member to compress which in turn causes the latched member to move inward to clear from the aperture of the first tube and the hole of the second tube, thus unlocking the second tube.</claim-text>
