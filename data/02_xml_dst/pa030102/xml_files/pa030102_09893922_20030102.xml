<summary-of-invention>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to optical systems and, more particularly, to high-power optical systems that include an intermediate focus of the optical beam. </paragraph>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In many optical systems, the optical beam is focused by the optical elements to an intermediate image at a location within the optical system. When the optical beam is a low-power beam, that intermediate focus poses no problem. However, when the optical beam is a high-power beam, the intermediate focus may have such a high optical power density that the air in the vicinity of the intermediate focus is ionized. The ionization of the air through which the optical beam passes distorts the ionizing optical beam, as well as other optical beams that pass through the intermediate focus, in an uncontrolled manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The ionization adversely affects the imaging of the optical beam. High-power optical beams are not normally imaged, but in some cases the optical beam includes both a high-power wavelength component that is not imaged, and a low-power wavelength component that is imaged. An example is a laser designator, in which a high-power designator beam at a first wavelength is propagated in one direction along the optical path from a source within the optical system to an external target, and a lower-power imaging beam at a second wavelength is propagated in the opposite direction along the optical path to a sensor within the optical system. If the optical system involves an intermediate focus, the ionization produced by the high-power optical beam at the intermediate focus results in a wavefront distortion that adversely affects the imaging of the low-power optical beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> To avoid the ionization effect, the intermediate focus may be formed in a vacuum. There is no air to ionize, and the problems discussed above do not arise. However, a vacuum chamber added to an optical system to contain all or a part of the optical system adds weight and complexity to the optical system, may be difficult to maintain in hostile environments to avoid leaks, requires the use of special light-transparent materials in some cases, and may involve a significant transmission loss at the windows of the vacuum system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> There is a need for a better approach to optical systems that avoids such ionization problems. The present invention fulfills this need, and further provides related advantages. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides an optical system with an intermediate focus of the optical beam in air or other gas, but which avoids ionization of the gas by a high-power beam that is focused at the intermediate focus. No vacuum chamber is utilized around the location of the intermediate focus, thereby avoiding the weight, complexity, maintenance difficulties, materials requirements, and transmission loss associated with the presence of the vacuum chamber. The present approach is operable with a single high-power wavelength component of the optical beam, but is more advantageously used where there is both a high-power wavelength component and an imaged low-power wavelength component that are transmitted along the same optical path through the optical system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the invention, an optical system has a light source of an optical beam, and a wavefront distortion generator that introduces a known wavefront distortion into at least one wavelength component of the optical beam prior to the formation of an intermediate image. A focusing device receives the optical beam, produces the intermediate image of the optical beam, and outputs the optical beam. An example of a focusing device is an three-mirror anastigmat. After the formation of the intermediate image, a wavefront distortion corrector introduces a wavefront distortion correction into each component of the optical beam into which the known wavefront distortion was introduced by the wavefront distortion generator. The wavefront distortion correction is the reverse of the known wavefront distortion introduced into the optical beam by the wavefront distortion generator. The wavefront distortion generator and the wavefront distortion corrector may each be a reflective optical element or a refractive optical element. The wavefront distortion generator and the wavefront distortion corrector may be separate from the focusing device, or at least one of the wavefront distortion generator and the wavefront distortion corrector may be integral with the focusing device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the optical beam has exactly one wavelength component, the wavefront distortion generator introduces the known wavefront distortion into the exactly one wavelength component, and the wavefront distortion corrector introduces the wavefront distortion correction into the exactly one wavelength component. In another embodiment, the optical beam has a first wavelength component and a second wavelength component, the wavefront distortion generator introduces the known wavefront distortion into the first wavelength component but not the second wavelength component, and the wavefront distortion corrector introduces the wavefront distortion correction into the first wavelength component but not the second wavelength component. In this second embodiment, the first wavelength component and the second wavelength component may be propagated in the same direction, or they may be propagated in opposite directions through the optical system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A method of processing an optical beam comprises the steps of supplying the optical beam, thereafter introducing a known wavefront distortion into a least one wavelength component of the optical beam to form a distorted optical beam, thereafter forming an intermediate image of the distorted optical beam, and thereafter introducing a wavefront distortion correction into each wavelength component of the optical beam into which the known wavefront distortion was introduced. The wavefront distortion correction is the reverse of the known wavefront distortion introduced into the optical beam. This method may be applied to an optical beam having a single wavelength component, or to an optical beam having more than one wavelength component, as described earlier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present approach avoids the formation of a high-power-density intermediate image by distorting or aberrating the optical beam prior to its reaching the location of the intermediate image, and then correcting the wavefront distortion of the optical beam after it passes the location of the intermediate image. The wavefront distortion generator for the introduction of a controlled, known wavefront distortion may be designed using conventional optical design techniques. The tracing of the distorted optical beam through the location of the intermediate image allows the power density of the distorted optical beam at that location to be determined, and the required wavefront distortion is selected so that the power density is below that which will ionize the gas present at the location of the intermediate image. Because the wavefront distortion is known from the design parameters, the corresponding reverse wavefront distortion correction may also be readily designed into the wavefront distortion corrector. The wavefront distortion generator and the wavefront distortion corrector are configured to distort the optical beam inversely to each other, and they therefore operate equally well on optical beam wavelength components propagated in the same direction or optical beam wavelength components propagated in opposite directions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of the preferred embodiment, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention. The scope of the invention is not, however, limited to this preferred embodiment.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a prior optical system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> having a focusing device in the form of a three-mirror anastigmat <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The three-mirror anastigmat <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> includes a primary mirror <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, a secondary mirror <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, and a tertiary mirror <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. An optical beam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> passes through the three-mirror anastigmat <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in either direction. The three-mirror anastigmat <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> focuses the optical beam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at an intermediate image <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> located between the secondary mirror <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and the tertiary mirror <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. If the optical beam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is or includes a high-power beam such as a high-power laser beam, the power density of the optical beam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> at the location of the intermediate image <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be so high that the air or other gas at that location is ionized. The ionized gas distorts the optical beam in an uncontrolled manner, interfering with the optical performance of the optical system at other locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> To prevent this uncontrolled wavefront distortion where such a focusing device must be used, it has been the prior practice to remove the ionizable gas from the location of the intermediate image <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, using a vacuum system <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The vacuum system <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> includes a vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> that is evacuated by a vacuum pump <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, and windows <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> so transmit the optical beam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into and out of the vacuum chamber <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. In this case, the vacuum system is illustrated as enclosing the entire three-mirror anastigmat <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, but it may instead be configured to enclose only the location of the intermediate image <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. While operable and suitable for some applications, the use of the vacuum system <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> increases the weight, complexity, and cost of the optical system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The maintenance of the vacuum system <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> with its pump and seals to ensure a vacuum when the optical system <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is to be used is a continuing concern. Additionally, the vacuum system <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> requires special materials for the windows <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>, and the presence of the windows <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> attenuates the optical beam <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and may lead to unacceptable system heating. The problems with the formation of an intermediate image of a high-power optical beam have been illustrated in terms of the three-mirror anastigmat <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> as the focusing device, but the same problems arise in other types of optical systems that form such an intermediate image of a high-power optical beam. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates an optical system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> according to the invention that overcomes these problems and eliminates the need for the vacuum system. The optical system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a light source <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> for each wavelength component of an optical beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. A wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> introduces a known wavefront distortion (i.e., an aberration of the light wavefront) into at least one wavelength component of the optical beam prior <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to the formation of an intermediate image. A focusing device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> receives the optical beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, produces the intermediate image of the optical beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, and outputs the optical beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (As used herein, &ldquo;intermediate image&rdquo; includes an intermediate image or other intermediate spatially focused or concentrated portion of the optical beam where the local beam power density is increased over its value at a remote location, other than a final image or focus of the beam. Such intermediate images often occur in optical systems.) After the formation of the intermediate image in the focusing device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, a wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> introduces a wavefront distortion correction into each component of the optical beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> into which the known wavefront distortion was introduced by the wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. The wavefront distortion correction is the reverse of the known wavefront distortion introduced into the optical beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> by the wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The nature and magnitude of the known wavefront distortion are selected to spoil the intermediate image sufficiently that the optical power density of the optical beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> at all locations within and near the location of the intermediate image is below that required to ionize air or other gas present at the location of the intermediate image. This calculation is readily made by optics programs such as the CODEV&trade; program, which are known in the art for other purposes. These programs allow the tracing of ray paths and the calculation of the optical power density at each location along the beam path, including at the location of the intermediate image. The result of introducing the known wavefront distortion is that the air or other gas at the location of the intermediate image is not ionized, and therefore no vacuum system is needed. The nature and magnitude of the wavefront distortion introduced by the wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> are known design parameters, and therefore the same design parameters are used, except inversely, to design the wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Consequently, the optical beam leaving the wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is free of the optical wavefront distortion introduced at the wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Because the optical path through the optical system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is reciprocal in nature, light may propagate along a ray path in either direction through the optical system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and enjoy the benefits of the present approach. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The general approach of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> may be implemented in a number of ways, and FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> illustrate some of these ways. These examples are depicted in relation to the three-mirror anastigmat as the focusing device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, but their depictions of wavefront distortion generators and wavefront distortion correctors are equally applicable to other types of focusing devices that produce an intermediate image (i.e., an image or other focused or concentrated region of the beam that is not the final image on a sensor or other device). In these examples, numbers of common elements are assigned the same reference numerals, and the other discussion is incorporated into the discussion of each example as appropriate. Only a single ray path is shown in the overall drawings such as <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 5</cross-reference>, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>, to avoid clutter. Features of the various embodiments may be used consistently in other combinations with each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is a refractive lens placed at the entrance pupil of the three-mirror anastigmat <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> that serves as the focusing device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The refractive lens wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is a lens made of a material that is transparent to the wavelengths in the light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. The entry side of the lens may be flat, and the exit side may have an aspheric surface of a shape designed to impart the desired aberration to the light beam. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows this arrangement in more detail. The refractive wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is placed at the entrance pupil of the three-mirror anastigmat <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to controllably distort the optical beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> so that an intermediate focus <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is aberrated to a large spot size with a low optical power density rather than a very small spot size with a high optical power density. The refractive wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is designed so that the aberration at the aberrated intermediate focus <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is sufficient that the gas at that location is not ionized. The known wavefront distortion is reflectively corrected in this case at the reflection from the primary mirror <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, which serves as the wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, of the three-mirror anastigmat <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The primary mirror is designed to introduce the required wavefront distortion correction that is the reverse of the wavefront distortion introduced by the lens distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. This embodiment has the advantage that it is applicable to the light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> having a wide spectral band and a wide field of view. In this case, the wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and the wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> are integral with the focusing device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, fold mirrors <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in this case are simple reflective mirrors that do not introduce any wavefront distortions into the reflected optical beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> has a refractive lens wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and a refractive lens wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, each of which is not integral with the focusing device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. The refractive lens wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has the aspheric surface shaped with the reverse of the aberration introduced by the refractive lens of the wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. A reflective wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> or a diffractive wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be used instead of the refractive wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in this and other embodiments where operable. A reflective wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> or a diffractive wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> may be used instead of the refractive wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in this and other embodiments where operable. </paragraph>

The light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>having the wavelength component &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>enters from the right, passes through the wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> (which for the light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>actually serves to introduce the wavefront distortion into the light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), passes through the focusing device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> in the opposite direction to the passage of the light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, passes through the refractive wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> (which for the light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>actually serves to correct the wavefront distortion in the light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>), is reflected by the wavelength-selective mirror <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and is received by the detector <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. This ability of the optical system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to process oppositely traveling light beams <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>arises from the reverse nature of the optical system, particularly the components <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> depicts an optical system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in which only the first wavelength component <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is distorted and corrected. The first wavelength component <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>passes through the refractive optical corrector <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> from left to right, through the wavelength selective mirror <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>, and through the focusing device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. It then reflects from a selective wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, which serves as the wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for the first wavelength component <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by correcting the wavefront distortion in the first wavelength component <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, but has no effect on the second wavelength component <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>other than to reflect it. The second wavelength component <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, traveling from right to left, reflects from the selective wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> without having any wavefront distortion introduced, passes through the focusing device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and reflects from the wavelength-selective mirror <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and to the detector <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> (without passing through component <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>). Thus, in the embodiment of the optical system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, only the light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is distorted and corrected prior to passing through the focusing device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>, and no wavefront distortion/correction is introduced into the light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. This selectivity is appropriate, because in this example the light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, is a high-power laser beam, such as at 1.06 micrometers wavelength, while the light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is a low-power beam of visible, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and/or far-infrared wavelength. Only the high-power light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>can cause the ionization in the focusing device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> if not wavefront distorted. The embodiments of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference> differ in that the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> distorts and corrects light of all wavelength components, while the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> distorts and corrects only the wavelength component (light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) of sufficiently high optical energy density to ionize gas at the intermediate focus in the focusing device <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> One form of the selective wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. A piece of transparent glass <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> (or other transparent material) has a multi-layer thin film <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> such as a Rugate filter applied to its distortion-free front surface <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The multi-layer thin film <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is designed to reflect light of wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>but transmit light of wavelength &lgr;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>. Such multi-layer thin films <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> are widely used for other purposes, such as anti-reflective coatings. The light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>therefore reflects from the selective wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> without any wavefront distortion. That is, for the light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>the selective wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> serves only as a fold mirror. The light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>passes through the multi-layer thin film <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> and reflects from its back surface <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The back surface <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> has the reverse of the wavefront distortion that was introduced into the light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>at the refractive wavefront distortion generator <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>. After reflection from the wavefront distortion-correcting back surface <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>, the light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>again passes through the multi-layer thin film <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The selective wavefront distortion corrector <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> thus introduces the required wavefront distortion correction into the light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, but does not introduce any wavefront distortion into the light beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> depicts a preferred approach for practicing the method of the invention. The method includes supplying the optical beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, numeral <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. A known wavefront distortion is thereafter introduced into a least one wavelength component of the optical beam <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> to form a distorted optical beam, numeral <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. An intermediate image of the distorted optical beam is thereafter formed, numeral <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight>. A wavefront distortion correction is thereafter introduced into each wavelength of the optical beam into which the known wavefront distortion was introduced, numeral <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. The wavefront distortion correction is the reverse of the known wavefront distortion introduced into the optical beam. These steps may be practiced with any of the embodiments of the optical system <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> discussed herein, or any other operable optical system. </paragraph>
