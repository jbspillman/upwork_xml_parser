<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> 1. Technical Field </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to ratchet tools. According to the present invention, a ratchet tool is provided which prevents spreading apart of the head of the ratchet tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 2. Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Pneumatic, and other, ratchet tools operate by reciprocating movement of a yoke that engages a pawl. The pawl is connected to a shank spindle and is selectively positionable such that the yoke, when reciprocating, engages the pawl to forcibly turn the pawl and shank spindle in a selected direction. The shank spindle includes a shank spindle output shaft, to which is commonly attached a socket, which is then applied to a workpiece being operated upon. Typically this workpiece may be a nut or bolt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In the related art, proper operation of the ratchet tool is reliant upon retainment of the shank spindle in the head via at least one thrust washer, possibly in combination with one or more retaining rings. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,896,789 to Giardino, incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> A common occurrence during operation is for the socket to become misaligned or cocked on the nut. When this happens, the ratchet tool user typically forcefully moves the ratchet tool back and force in an attempt to loosen the socket from the nut. The back and force movement imparts a lateral force on the shank spindle output shaft, and a moment arm is created which causes movement of the thrust washers within the head. This movement of the thrust washers in turn causes the head to spread apart, resulting in loosening of the component parts and diminished performance of the ratchet tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is therefore a feature of the present invention to provide a thrust washer which prevents spreading of the head of the ratchet tool. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the above deficiencies by providing a thrust washer having a smaller overall-diameter to edge-height ratio than the overall-diameter to edge-height ratio of the related art thrust washer. Overall-diameter refers to the diameter of the thrust washer measured at the outer edge of the thrust washer. Similarly, edge-height refers to the height or thickness of the thrust washer at its outer edge. The smaller overall-diameter to edge-height ratio is obtained by increasing the edge-height of the thrust washer, which will eliminate spreading of the head. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a thrust washer is used in combination with a shank spindle having an increased thickness at those regions that contact the thrust washer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention is also drawn to a ratchet tool incorporating the thrust washers described above, and a method of operation of a ratchet tool using the above teachings. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> While the present invention will be described for use in ratchet tool, such as, inter alia, a fluid driven ratchet tool, one of ordinary skill in the art should recognize that the present invention is not limited to such devices. For instance, the teachings of the present invention can be used in any ratchet tool with or without a fluid driven motor, e.g., an electrically operated ratchet tool. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> discloses a cross-sectional side view of a portion of a ratchet head <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> of the related art. Ratchet head <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> comprises a first member <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and a second member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Each member <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is characterized by a first member height h<highlight><subscript>j1</subscript></highlight>. The first member <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> includes a first interior surface <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, while the second member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> similarly includes a second interior surface <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. The first and second interior surfaces <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> of the members <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> are operationally engaged by one or more stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. A shank spindle <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is operationally fixed in the ratchet head <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> between the members <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. The shank spindle <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is characterized by an inner height h<highlight><subscript>s1</subscript></highlight>. The shank spindle <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is also operationally engaged by the one or more stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. A biasing device such as, inter alia, spring-biased ball bearings <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and bias springs <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, are provided which force the thrust washers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> to bear upon the first and second interior surfaces <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight>. The spring-biased ball bearings <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> may be used in either single (not shown) or double form. A shank spindle output shaft <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> of the shank spindle <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> is operationally attached to a socket <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, or similar device, having a socket opening <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> for attachment to a workpiece (not shown) such as, inter alia, a nut or bolt. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the related art embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> are characterized by an overall-diameter dimension d, and a edge-height dimension h measured at the outer peripheral edge of the stepped thrust washer (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>). Combining these two dimensions yields an overall-diameter to edge-height ratio of d/h. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> One problem with the related art embodiments, which the present invention overcomes, becomes evident when a lateral force L<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>or L<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is applied to the socket <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The lateral force, L<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>or L<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, creates a moment arm in the yoke <highlight><bold>135</bold></highlight> of ratchet head <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> which produces movement of the first and second stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Movement of the stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> in turn imparts a force S<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>on the first member <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and a force S<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>on the second member <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Forces S<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and S<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>produce a tendency for spreading apart of the first and second members <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>, resulting in increased wear of ratchet tool component parts and diminished ratchet tool performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> A ratchet head <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. The ratchet head <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> comprises a first member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and a second member <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. Each member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is characterized by a second member height h<highlight><subscript>j2</subscript></highlight>, which is smaller than the first member height h<highlight><subscript>j1 </subscript></highlight>of the related art embodiment. The first member <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> includes a first interior surface <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>, while the second member <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> similarly includes a second interior surface <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight>. The first and second interior surfaces <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> of the ratchet head <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> are operationally engaged by one or more thick non-stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. A shank spindle <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is operationally fixed in the ratchet head <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. The shank spindle <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is characterized by the same inner height h<highlight><subscript>s1 </subscript></highlight>as the related art embodiment. The shank spindle <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is also operationally engaged by the one or more thick non-stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight>. A biasing device such as, inter alia, spring-biased ball bearings <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> and bias springs <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, are provided which force the thrust washers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> to bear upon the first and second interior surfaces <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight>. The spring-biased ball bearings <highlight><bold>221</bold></highlight> may be used in either single (not shown) or double form. A shank spindle output shaft <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> of the shank spindle <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight> is operationally attached to a socket <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, or similar device, having a socket opening <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> for attachment to a workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The improved thick non-stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> do not have a stepped contour profile. Rather, the thick non-stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> are characterized by substantially co-parallel upper and lower surfaces. The thick non-stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> are further characterized a decreased overall-diameter to edge-height ratio, that is, the thick non-stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> have the same thickness or height H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> at their inner bore <highlight><bold>581</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>) as at their outer edge <highlight><bold>582</bold></highlight>. The thick non-stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> of this embodiment of the present invention are characterized by an overall diameter dimension D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, equal to the related art stepped thrust washer&apos;s overall diameter d, and an edge-height dimension H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> measured at the outer peripheral edge of the thick non-stepped thrust washer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> which is greater than the related art stepped thrust washer&apos;s edge-height dimension h. Combining these two dimensions yields an overall-diameter to edge-height ratio D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, which ratio is smaller than the related art stepped thrust washer&apos;s overall-diameter to edge-height ratio d/h. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to this first embodiment of the present invention, when a lateral force L<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>or L<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is applied to the socket <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, the lateral force, L<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>or L<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, will not create a moment arm in the yoke <highlight><bold>235</bold></highlight> of the ratchet head <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Therefore, movement of the first and second thick non-stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> will be prevented. Consequently, force S<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>on the first head <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and force S<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>on the second head <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> will also be prevented, so that any spreading of the first and second members <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is similarly prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> depicts a cross-sectional view of a second embodiment of a ratchet head <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Ratchet head <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> comprises a first member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and a second member <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight>. Each member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is characterized by the second member height h<highlight><subscript>j2</subscript></highlight>, which is smaller than the first member height h<highlight><subscript>j1 </subscript></highlight>of the related art embodiment. The first member <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> includes a first interior surface <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, while the second member <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> similarly includes a second interior surface <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>. The first and second interior surfaces <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight> of the ratchet head <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> are operationally engaged by one or more thin non-stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>. A biasing device such as, inter alia, spring-biased ball bearings <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> and bias springs <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight>, are provided which force the thrust washers <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> to bear upon the first and second interior surfaces <highlight><bold>390</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>392</bold></highlight>. The spring-biased ball bearings <highlight><bold>321</bold></highlight> may be used in either single (not shown) or double form. A shank spindle <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> is operationally fixed in the ratchet head <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. The shank spindle <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> is characterized by an inner height h<highlight><subscript>s2 </subscript></highlight>which is greater than the inner height h<highlight><subscript>s1 </subscript></highlight>of the first embodiment of the present invention. The shank spindle <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> is also operationally engaged by the one or more thin non-stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>. A shank spindle output shaft <highlight><bold>362</bold></highlight> of the shank spindle <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight> is operationally attached to a socket <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, or similar device, having a socket opening <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> for attachment to a workpiece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The thin non-stepped thrust washers have a decreased diameter to height ratio as compared to the stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> of the related art shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The improved thin non-stepped thrust washer <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> do not have a stepped contour profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The thin non-stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> are characterized by a decreased overall-diameter to edge-height ratio, that is, the thin non-stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> have the same thickness or height H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> at their inner bore <highlight><bold>681</bold></highlight> as at their outer edge <highlight><bold>682</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference>). The thin non-stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> of this embodiment of the present invention are characterized by an overall-diameter dimension D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, equal to the related art stepped thrust washer&apos;s overall-diameter d, and an edge-height dimension H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> measured at the outer peripheral edge of the thrust washer <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> which is greater than the related art stepped thrust washer&apos;s edge-height dimension h. Combining these two dimensions yields an overall-diameter to edge-height ratio D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, which is smaller than the related art stepped thrust washer&apos;s overall-diameter to edge-height ratio d/h. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A corresponding increase in the inner height h<highlight><subscript>s2 </subscript></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) of the shank spindle may be employed to accommodate the reduced height dimension of the thin non-stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, a plurality of thin non-stepped washers <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> may be stacked to achieve a desired height and employed in place of the thick non-stepped washers <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> According to this second embodiment of the present invention, when a lateral force L<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>or L<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>is applied to the socket <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>, the lateral force, L<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>or L<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, will not create a moment arm in the yoke <highlight><bold>335</bold></highlight> of the ratchet head <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>. Therefore, movement of the first and second thin non-stepped thrust washers <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> will be prevented. Consequently, force S<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>on the first head <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight> and force S<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>on the second head <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> will be prevented, so that any spreading of the first and second head <highlight><bold>350</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>352</bold></highlight> is similarly prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>, a plan view and cross-sectional view, respectively, of related art embodiment of a stepped thrust washer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is shown. The stepped thrust washer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> is characterized by an overall-diameter d and an edge-height h. The edge-height h is defined as the height at the periphery or overall-diameter of the stepped thrust washer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. The overall-diameter to edge-height ratio d/h can thus be established for this stepped thrust washer <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> show a plan view and a cross-sectional view, respectively, of the novel thick non-stepped thrust washer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> having a decreased overall-diameter to edge-height ratio in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The thick non-stepped thrust washer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> is characterized by an overall-diameter D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and an edge-height H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The edge-height H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is defined as the height at the periphery or overall-diameter of the thick non-stepped thrust washer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The overall-diameter to edge-height ratio D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can thus be established for this thick non-stepped thrust washer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. Comparing the overall-diameter to edge-height ratio of the stepped thrust washer (i.e., d/h) to the thick non-stepped washer (i.e., D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>/H<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>), it can be seen that a decrease in this ratio is desirable, as it is indicative of a thick non-stepped thrust washer <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Non-stepped thrust washers may be employed in either a &ldquo;thick&rdquo; version (<highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) or a &ldquo;thin&rdquo; version (<highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>342</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) with a correspondingly sized shank spindle <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>360</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</cross-reference> show a plan view and a cross-sectional view, respectively, of the novel thin non-stepped thrust washer <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> having a decreased overall-diameter to edge-height ratio in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The thin non-stepped thrust washer <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight> is characterized by an overall-diameter D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and an edge-height H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. The edge-height H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is defined as the height at the periphery or overall-diameter of the non-stepped thrust washer <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. The overall-diameter to edge-height ratio D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can thus be established for this non-stepped thrust washer <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. Comparing the overall-diameter to edge-height ratio of the stepped thrust washer (i.e., d/h) to the thin non-stepped washer (i.e., D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>/H<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>), it can be seen that a decrease in this ratio is desirable, as it is indicative of a thin non-stepped thrust washer <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Non-stepped thrust washers may further be employed in either a continuous or discontinuous ring form. That is, the non-stepped thrust washers may have the continuous form of the letter &ldquo;O&rdquo;, or the discontinuous form of the letter &ldquo;C&rdquo;. Other embodiments known to those skilled in the art will be readily apparent, such as, inter alia, a split-ring form or a helical form. </paragraph>
