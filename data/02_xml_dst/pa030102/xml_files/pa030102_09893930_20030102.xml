<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to hoists or load assemblies. More specifically, the invention pertains to such apparatuses that are portable. In addition, the invention involves hoist assemblies that are used with a trailer hitch of a vehicle. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Loading large or heavy objects in commercial or industrial settings is often done with the use of pallets and forklifts or the like. In such settings heavy equipment is available for laborers to lift and move these objects. Oftentimes, individuals are faced with loading large or heavy objects in residential, recreational or agricultural environments. In addition, a person may be in a remote location where lifting equipment is not available. For example, hunters having killed large game such as deer are faced with cleaning and loading the carcass onto a truck or sports utility vehicle. Similarly, a farmer may have a need for lifting large, heavy objects onto a vehicle, but may not have the necessary equipment available at that point in time, or at that particular location. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, a need exists for a hoist assembly that is portable in nature but structurally sound to lift objects that an individual may not otherwise be able to handle. In addition, it is beneficial for such an assembly to be adapted for use with a trailer hitch on a vehicle. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The present invention is for a portable hoist assembly. The hoist assembly includes a base member, support member and boom. A winch assembly is connected to the support member and boom, and an engagement member is attached a line for lifting objects. The base member and boom are pivotally attached to the support member enabling one to collapse the hoist assembly to a storage position. The engagement member is detachable from the line, inserted and secured in the support member, boom or base member for storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The base member is inserted into a receiving member. In the case of the hoist assembly with a vehicle, the receiving member takes the form of trailer hitch within which the base member fits. An indicator on the base member identifies that portion of the base member necessary to fit within the receiving member for operation of the hoist assembly. The support member is pivoted to a substantially upright position. The boom is rotated to extend lateral of the support member. A winch assembly is mounted to the support member and line from the winch is threaded through a pulley. An engagement member is attached to a free end of the line for lifting objects.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention for a portable hoist assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and is shown in use with a vehicle <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> having receiving member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> as a trailer hitch. However, the hoist assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is not intended to be limited to use with a motor vehicle, but may be used with any mobile or stationary loading area having an acceptable receiving member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The hoist assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> includes a base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and boom <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A winch assembly is attached to the hoist assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and as shown includes a winch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> mounted to the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. A line <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>, coiled on the winch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, extends upward through a pulley <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> mounted to the boom <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. An engagement member <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is attached to the free end of the line <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> by a clip <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The engagement member <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a gambrel having a pair of hooks for engaging objects for lifting. The gambrel may also support straps, lines, cables etc. that may used to engage objects for lifting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is connected to the receiving member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. In a preferred embodiment, the base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has an outside diameter that is less than the inside diameter of the receiving member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. Accordingly, the base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is inserted into the receiving member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>. The receiving member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> can be of a sufficient length such that fasteners or pins are not required to secure the hoist assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in place. For example the receiving member of trailer hitch has an inside length of six to seven inches. The base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> should by at least that long so sufficient length of the base member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is inserted in the receiving member to support the hoist assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and lifted objects. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are pivotally joined at joint <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> so the two members can be collapsed into a storage position. When the base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is inserted in the receiving member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> extends in an upright position. In a preferred in embodiment, the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> includes a first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and a second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> connected in sliding engagement with the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> telescopes upward and downward along a longitudinal axis of the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> to a desired height. A locking pin <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> extends through the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and abuts the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> securing the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the locking pin <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> seats within recesses <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> formed in the top edge of the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The recesses <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> are aligned with apertures in the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> through which the locking pin <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> extends. Alternatively, an aperture, below a top edge of the first support member, may be formed for receiving the pin. In either case, the pin <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> seats in the recess <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, or an aperture, and inhibits rotational movement of the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> within the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> With respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1, 2</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are coupled at joint <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. When the base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is inserted into the receiving member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is rotated to an upright position. A locking pin <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> locks the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in an upright position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The joint <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, and joint <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> referred to below, are conventional joint assemblies known by those skilled in the art. For example, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the joint <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> simply includes a pair of opposing plates <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> fixed to the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. Each plate <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> has an aperture. A dowel <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>, fixed to the base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, extends through the apertures so the plates and dowel <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> pivot with respect to one another. A stop <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> attached to the base of the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, adjacent the joint <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. The stop <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> serves as a safety feature of the hoist assembly. The stop <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> prevents the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> from contacting one another when collapsed, which prevents an operator from smashing or pinching hands and fingers if the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is dropped or mishandled. The stop <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, is a flange section attached to a surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and extends substantially perpendicular to the surface <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> of the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The stop <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> could also be mounted to the base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> perpendicularly to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</cross-reference>, the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> has a tubular construction and the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> telescopes up and down within the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A brake <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is mounted to a bottom end of the second support <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to control the descent of the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> within the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. For example, if an operator is adjusting the height of the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and drops the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>, the brake <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> prevents the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from quickly dropping in the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> which could cause injury. The brake <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is a rubber foot pad that fits snuggly on the bottom end and has a flange portion <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> that has an outside diameter slightly less than the inside diameter of the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is preferably plugged at its bottom end. In addition, apertures formed in the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> are usually disposed above the brake <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>. In this manner, air is not able to escape to quickly as the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> drops within the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. The air trapped beneath brake <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> is compressed, and prevents the brake <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> from quickly dropping. The brake <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> thereby controls the descent of the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> within the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The boom <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is coupled to a top end of the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> at joint <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. The boom <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> are pivotally connected so the boom <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be folded into a storage position. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the boom <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> extends lateral of the loading area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> With respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</cross-reference>, the hoist assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown collapsed in a storage position. The locking pin <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> supporting the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in place is removed, and the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> telescopes downward in the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> until the joint <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> abuts the top end of the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. As the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> drops within the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, the brake <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> controls the rate of descent to prevent injury to an operator or damage to the hoist assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, the boom <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are aligned endto-end along the same side of the support member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, opposite the winch <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. When the second support member is fully drawn in the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, an end portion of the boom <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> fits within the base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The locking pin <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> is inserted through aligned apertures of the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> and second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to secure the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> in its stored position. In this manner, boom <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is locked within the base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is unable to slide out of the first support member <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, and approximately 2 to 3 inches of the boom <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> fits within the base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The boom <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> cannot be removed from the base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> without first releasing the second support member <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from the first support member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The hoist assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can then be removed in this reduced position. The base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is then removed from the receiving member <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>, and pivoted to its stored position. The engagement member <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is also removed and inserted into the base member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The engagement member <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> shown in the drawings is a gambrel that includes a pair hooks. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the engagement member <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> extends through an end of the base member and locking pin <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> secures the engagement member <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> within the base member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> While the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein in the context of a portable hoist assembly, it will be obvious that such embodiments are provided by way of example only and not of limitation. Numerous variations, changes and substitutions will occur to those of skilled in the art without departing from the invention herein. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention be limited only by the spirit and scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
