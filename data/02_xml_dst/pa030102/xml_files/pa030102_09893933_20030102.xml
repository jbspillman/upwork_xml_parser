<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a portable device charger, and more particularly to a charger having circuitry adapted to protect a vehicle battery power source from excessive drain. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Portable devices such as cell phones and handheld computers are often charged by a user in transit to a remote location. The charging of a portable electronic device in transit affords the advantage of assuring that the device is as fully charged as possible upon arrival at a remote location. It is commonplace for a charger to remain in permanent electrical contact with the cigarette lighter of a vehicle electrical system. Conventional chargers often include an indicator light emitting diode (LED) to alert a vehicle operator that the charger is in electrical contact with the vehicle electrical system. The constant illumination of the indicator LED often raises concerns with a vehicle operator that the charger is unnecessarily draining the vehicle battery while the vehicle is not running. Thus, it is common for a vehicle operator to disengage the charger from the vehicle cigarette lighter receptacle to prevent an unnecessary vehicle battery drain and extinguish the indicator LED. The additional wear on the charger electrical contacts associated with disengaging the charger from the cigarette lighter shortens the service lifetime of the charger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> A further concern in utilizing a vehicle electrical system as a power source to charge a portable electronic device focuses on concerns that drawing current from a battery that has begun to fail or charging from a vehicle electrical system from a vehicle that has not been run over a prolonged period of time so as to recharge the vehicle battery. These concerns are amplified in climates where the electrical system of the vehicle is particularly burdened in starting the vehicle. Thus, there exists a need for a charger that senses the condition of a battery power source and disables portable electronic device charging when the sensed power source has a measured property below a preselected threshold. </paragraph>
</section>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> A portable electronic charger device includes a charger housing having a coupler portion adapted to engage a cigarette lighter source of a vehicle and also having a main body portion. An electrical contact extends from the coupler portion and is adapted to electrically engage the cigarette lighter power source of a vehicle. An electrical circuit intermediate between the cigarette lighter power source and a portable electronic device is adapted to sense the input voltage of the vehicle power source and prevent current flow to the portable electronic device when the input voltage is below a preselected threshold. Typically, the preselected threshold is between 12 and 13.6 volts. In another embodiment, an LED indicating electrical contact between an inventive charger and a cigarette lighter power source is deactivated with a manual switch to prevent power drain on a parked vehicle. An air purification system is optionally coupled to an inventive charger to prevent electrostatic dust accumulation on charger and device components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> An inventive charger in another embodiment includes a coupler portion adapted to electrically engage the cigarette lighter power source of a vehicle through electrical contacts, a body portion and a flexible or jointed portion therebetween. The flexible portion accommodating a variety of vehicle geometries in the area surrounding a cigarette lighter power source. A connector complementary to a portable electronic device is provided to couple a given device for charging purposes.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention has utility as a portable electronic device charger, particularly well suited for operation from a vehicle power system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an inventive charger is shown generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The portable charger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is adapted to plug into a direct current cigarette lighter socket of a vehicle power system. The charger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a charger housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> having a coupler portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> adapted to be inserted into the vehicle direct current cigarette lighter socket. The coupler portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> has an electrical contact <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> extending therefrom and adapted to engage a cigarette lighter socket sidewall in order to electrically ground the inventive charger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The coupler portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> also terminates in an electrical contact <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> adapted to engage the voltage contact of the vehicle direct current cigarette lighter S. The charger housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> also includes a main body portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, a flexible portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> interconnects coupler portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and main body portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The flexible portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> includes a ball joint fitting <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and more preferably a second ball joint fitting <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> arranged to accommodate various vehicle geometries in the region around the lighter socket S. A covering <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> prevents entrainment of debris within a ball joint <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of the flexible portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, in the present invention a reticulated elastomeric tube member (not shown) is operative as a flexible portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The main body portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> includes electrical circuitry (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) that upon the charger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> engaging the cigarette lighter socket S, the circuitry senses the direct current input voltage from the vehicle power system and prevents current flow to a coupled device D when the input voltage is below a preselected threshold. In a typical vehicle power supply, the charger activation voltage threshold is 12.6 volts. Thus, the inventive charger having a 12.6 volt activation threshold will not allow current flow to an electrically coupled portable electronic device D when the vehicle is not running or the vehicle battery is beginning to fail through, for example, a shorted battery cell or dislodgement of a battery ground. It will be appreciated that other vehicle voltage thresholds are operative herein based upon the characteristics of the vehicle power system. In the embodiment of the present invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the charger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is electrically coupled to a portable electronic device shown in phantom at D by way of a coiled, externally insulated cord <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> terminating in a device connector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> complementary with that of the device D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a light emitting diode (LED) <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is observable on the housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of the charger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> while engaging a cigarette lighter socket S. The LED <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> activating upon the charger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being in electrical contact with the cigarette lighter S. A manual switch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is provided on the main body portion <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the housing <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in order to selectively deactivate the LED <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> thereby allaying concerns that the inventive charger <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is drawing current from cigarette lighter S at inopportune or undesirable times such as when the vehicle is not running for prolonged periods of time. It is appreciated that an LED manual deactivation switch <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is operative independently of voltage sensing circuitry. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, where like numbers correspond to components described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an inventive charger is shown generally at <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. The flexible portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is defined by a pair of hinged pivots offset at approximately a right angle to afford charger orientation adapted to various vehicle geometries in the region about the lighter socket S. The rearward face <highlight><bold>53</bold></highlight> of the charger <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> optionally has a charger socket <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> similar to that of the vehicle socket S. The socket <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> is provided to allow coupling of another electrical device or the heating element provided with the vehicle that absent the inventive charger inserts into the lighter socket S. An optional spring loaded cover <highlight><bold>57</bold></highlight> prevents debris accumulation within the socket <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the embodiment of the invention depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> couples to the device D by way of a docking fixture <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having a device complementary connector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> extending into the cavity <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> defined by the docking fixture <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> adapted to receive the device D. Thus, the device connector <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> electrically engages the device D upon the device being seated within the docking fixture <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, the flexible portion <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is contemplated to maintain an orientation upon being fixed and while the inventive charger is docking a device D. Optionally, an LED <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is provided to indicate connectivity to a cigarette lighter socket S. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> charger <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> according to the present invention includes within the housing <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> an air purifier <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> with like number elements being the same as those detailed with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. The air purifier <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having an ionization source. An air purifier operates with a charger to lessen the accumulation of dust and other particulate on device and charger components associated with static charging associated with the device charging process. Preferably, the air purification system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> includes an ionization source <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> for electrostatic decomposition of airborne compounds and particulate that foul the air within the vehicle passenger compartment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of the present invention having minimum voltage sensing circuitry and a manual on-off switch <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, as well as an air purification system <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the switch is preferably a three position slide switch <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. The three slide positions include &ldquo;off&rdquo; having an inactive device charging and air purification system function denoted by an inactive LED if an LED <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is present. A second switch position is &ldquo;charge only&rdquo; activating only the device charging aspect and an inactive air purification system that is indicated by a flashing LED if an LED is present. The third switch position is &ldquo;all on&rdquo; denoting current flow to both the charger and the air purification system. A third switch position is indicated by a solid LED, if an LED <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is present. An &ldquo;all on&rdquo; position when simultaneous charging and air purifying is desired, as well as should only air purification be desired then removing the device D from electrical contact with the inventive charger thus leaving the charging circuit open. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, the basic charging circuit is shown at <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. The circuit input <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> of circuit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is established by a charger terminal contact such as <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> being in electrical contact with a positive voltage supplied by the direct current cigarette lighter. The ground input <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> results from an electrical contact such as <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> being in electrical communication with the side of the cigarette lighter power source S. The direct current voltage applied across terminals <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> is detailed above in the typical vehicle ranges from about 12 to 13.6 volts. A voltage sensing subcircuit <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> measures the voltage across terminals <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> and only if the voltage across the source S is greater than a predetermined threshold of approximately 12.6 volts is the remainder of the circuit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> activated. Provided the voltage of the source S is greater than the minimum voltage threshold, then a manual on-off switch <highlight><bold>234</bold></highlight>, shown in an active position, allows an indicator LED <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> to be illuminated indicating that the charger circuit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is active and a current limited by a resistor <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is applied to the portable electronic device D rechargeable cells. Line <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> thus applies current to the selector switch <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> that when switched to the &ldquo;all on&rdquo; position activates the charger and air purification functions. When the switch <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> is moved to the &ldquo;charger on&rdquo; position only, current flows to the charger subcircuit and a feedback capacitor <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> modulates the LED <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> such that it illuminates only intermittently. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Voltage on line <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> of the charger subcircuit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> includes a current limiting resistor <highlight><bold>242</bold></highlight> shunted by a Zener diode <highlight><bold>244</bold></highlight> and connected to an isolated diode <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight>. Thus, the charger subcircuit <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> inputs a preselected voltage such that a portable electronic device D coupled thereto receives a device appropriate charging voltage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is appreciated that various alterations and modifications to the present invention which has been described in terms of the presently preferred embodiments will become apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended that the appended claims be interpreted as covering all alterations and modifications as defined by the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>
