<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to integrated circuits, and more particularly to heat exchanger systems for integrated circuits. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> After a short period of use, the internal components of electronic devices such as computers become heated. As a result, system performance suffers and system reliability degrades. However, performance and reliability may be restored by cooling the electrical components to remove excess heat. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In general, heat may be transferred from one body to another simply by bringing a cool body into contact with a warm body because heat tends to flow from warmer areas to cooler areas. However, simply touching two bodies together rarely yields an efficient heat transfer because pockets of heat insulating air are often trapped between irregularities in the mating surfaces. The efficiency of a heat transfer between two bodies may be improved using a thermal interface material (TIM). Typically, TIM&apos;s are malleable materials that conduct heat well, such as metallic or polymeric materials, thermal greases, thermal gels, or thermal greases/gels filled with metallic particles. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In computer systems, a computer chip may be cooled by coupling it with a heat exchanger. Because of space and other constraints, it is often impractical to mate the chip and heat exchanger directly. Typically, the chip is bonded to a heat conductive metal block using a TIM. The metal block is then coupled with a remote heat sink via a heat pipe. In most cases, the heat pipe is soldered at one end to the metal block and at the other to the heat sink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Heat pipes are known for having a small cross-sectional area and a low resistance to the transfer of thermal energy. Components of a heat pipe typically include a vacuum-sealed heat conductive tube containing a liquid and a porous metal wick. Often, the wick is which may be attached to an inner surface of the heat conductive tube. As the liquid inside the heat pipe vaporizes at the pipe&apos;s hot end and condenses at the pipe&apos;s cool end, heat is transferred from the metal block to the heat sink. Once condensed, the liquid flows via capillary action of the wick back to the hot end, and the circulation cycle continues as long as the metal block supplies heat and the temperature of the heat sink is low enough. Vacuum pressure inside the heat pipe ensures an efficient circulation cycle because liquids vaporize quickly at low pressures. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Generally speaking, heat is transferred more efficiently in desktop computer systems than in mobile computer systems. In desktop systems, the chip manufacturers bond the metal block to the chip using a high quality TIM. Whereas in mobile systems, original equipment manufacturers (OEM&apos;s) bond the block to the chip using a low quality TIM and an aggressive attachment method that challenges the reliability of the chip. Consequently, mobile platform heat exchangers tend to operate less efficiently than their desktop platform counterparts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Thus, a solution is needed that increases the effectiveness of mobile platform heat exchanger systems. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> An apparatus and method for assembling an on platform heat exchanger system for mobile platforms is disclosed. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that these specific details need not be used to practice the present invention. In other circumstances, well-known structures, materials, or processes have not been shown or described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, one embodiment of a heat pipe <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is shown. In contrast to the prior art, heat pipe <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may include a porous metal wick <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and two sections (<highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>) of a heat conductive tube. When connected, the sections <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight>, together with wick <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, form a heat pipe. In one embodiment, the first section <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the heat conductive tube may be attached to a heat conductive block (not shown) by a chip manufacturer. Similarly, at a separate time, an OEM (or other party) may attach the second section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the heat conductive tube to a heat sink (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Using soldering techniques common in the art, a heat pipe may be assembled by joining the first section <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the heat conductive tube to the second section <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the heat conductive tube. Because the chip manufacturer, not the OEM, bonds the metal block to the chip and to the first section <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of the metal heat conductive tube, the reliability of the chip is preserved. Joining sections <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> together permits a more efficient transfer of heat than if an OEM bonded a metal block to the chip and then bonded a heat pipe to the metal block for two reasons. First, the chip manufacturer typically uses a higher quality TIM than the OEM. Second, the thermal conductivity of the metal heat conductive tube is typically higher than the thermal conductivity of the other components of the system. Thus, soldering the two halves together provides an thermally efficient way of coupling the metal block to a heat exchanger. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Sections <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> of the heat conductive tube may be formed of any material that efficiently conducts heat. For example, heat conductive sections <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> may be fashioned from metals such as copper, aluminum, and stainless steel, from heat conductive metal alloys, or from other heat conductive materials. In one embodiment, the wick <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> may be formed of a porous metal, such as aluminum. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> diagram illustrating one embodiment of a mobile platform heat exchanger system is shown, In this embodiment, a first section <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of a heat conductive tube <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> (e.g. a heat pipe) is attached to a metal block <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>. The metal block <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight> is shown bonded to a chip package <highlight><bold>207</bold></highlight> using a TIM <highlight><bold>205</bold></highlight> and silicon layer <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. A second section <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the heat conductive tube <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is attached to a heat sink <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In one embodiment, the heat sink <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> may include a radiator <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight> and/or a fan <highlight><bold>209</bold></highlight>. Section <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the heat conductive tube <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be attached to the metal block <highlight><bold>201</bold></highlight>, and section <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the heat conductive tube <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be attached sink <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, using soldering materials, methods, and techniques known to those skilled in the art. In one embodiment, a first free end <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of first section <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the heat conductive tube <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> is configured to sealably couple to a second free end <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> of second section <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of the heat conductive tube <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be assembled using one of several methods. In one embodiment, a first portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of wick <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be inserted in first section <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. A second portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of wick <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be inserted in and protrude from second section <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. In this embodiment, first portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of wick <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> has a length less than the length of the first section <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> so that the length of the second portion <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of wick <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> that protrudes from the second portion <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may fit within the first section <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> when the two sections <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> are joined together at ends <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, respectively. In one embodiment, wick <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> is adhered or affixed to the interior of heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> using adhesion materials and techniques well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Once connected at ends <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight>, sections <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be sealably coupled using soldering processes, techniques, and materials known to persons skilled in the art. Additionally, a vacuum pressure may be created inside heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and a liquid, such as water, may be introduced and stored therein. A vacuum is created within heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> because liquids tend to vaporize quickly at low pressures, and vaporization is crucial to an efficient heat transfer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In a further embodiment, one or both of sections <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>of heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may include a small, pre-drilled injection port, which may be used to create a vacuum environment within heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>. A hollow needle coupled with a suction, injection, and capping machine may be removably inserted through the injection port into the heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, and the interior of heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be aspirated to create a vacuum therein. After a vacuum has been created, a liquid may be injected into the heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> through the hollow needle. As the needle is withdrawn, a fast curing liquid metal sealant or other sealant may be injected into the injection port to seal the injection port and prevent the liquid from escaping. Alternatively, a soldering process may be used to seal the injection port. In an alternative embodiment, heat pipe <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be assembled within a vacuum chamber. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, there is shown a flowchart illustrating one embodiment of a method used to assemble a heat pipe on a mobile platform. At Block <highlight><bold>301</bold></highlight>, a first portion of a wick is inserted within a first section of a heat conductive tube such that the wick protrudes past a free end of the first section of heat conductive tube. A proximal end of the heat conductive tube may be attached to a metal block. In another embodiment, the proximal end may be attached to a heat sink. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> At Block <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, a second portion of the wick is inserted within a second section of the heat conductive tube. The length of the second portion of the wick may be less than a length of the second section of the heat conductive tube. In one embodiment, a proximal end of the second section of heat conductive metal tube is attached to a metal block. In a further embodiment, the proximal end of the second section of heat conductive metal tube is attached to a heat sink. In yet another embodiment, both portions of the wick are adhered or affixed to the interior of their respective sections of the heat conductive tube. Additionally, the first and second sections of the heat conductive tube may each have a free end that is configured to sealably couple to the free end of the other section. In other words, a first free end of the first section of the heat conductive tube may be configured to sealably couple with a second free end of the second section of the heat conductive tube, and vice versa. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> At Block <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight>, a heat pipe is formed by joining and sealably coupling the first and second free ends together. In the above embodiment, where two portions of a wick are used, a first portion of the wick protruding from a section of heat conductive tube may be inserted into the other section of heat conductive tube until the first portion of the wick touches or compresses against the other portion of the wick. In an embodiment, where only a single portion of wick used, the part of the wick protruding from a section of heat conductive tube may be inserted into the other section of heat conductive tube until a free end of the wick touches or compresses against a proximal end of the other section of heat conductive tube. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> At Block <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight>, the wick may be adhered to the interior of the assembled heat pipe using heat-responsive adhesives. For example, portions of the wick may be coated with a heat-responsive adhesive before they are inserted within portions of a heat conductive tube. Once a heat pipe is assembled by joining the portions of heat conductive tube together, heat may be applied to the tube to activate the adhesive and bond the wick to the interior of the heat pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> At Block <highlight><bold>305</bold></highlight>, a vacuum is created within the assembled heat pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> At Block <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>, a liquid is introduced into the interior of the heat pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> At Block <highlight><bold>307</bold></highlight>, the heat pipe is sealed to prevent leaks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention is described herein with reference to a specific preferred embodiment, many modifications and variations therein will readily occur to those with ordinary skill in the art. Accordingly, all such variations and modifications are included within the intended scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims. </paragraph>
