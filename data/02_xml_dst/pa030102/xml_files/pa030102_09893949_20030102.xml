<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates generally to the field of eyeglass accessories, and more particularly to a neck leash retaining device for eye wear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Eyeglasses are known. They are worn to correct a vision impairment, or to shade the eyes by providing a tinted lens that protects the user from the sun&apos;s rays. Eyeglasses or goggles can also be worn to protect the eyes in sports activities. People who lead active lives, especially people engaged in various sports find it convenient to have a strap of some sort that attaches to each end of the ear pieces of the eyeglasses so that the strap goes around the user&apos;s neck. In this way the user can remove his or her glasses and the glasses are conveniently positioned on the users chest. In this way, the user can have quick access to the glasses. The strap system also provides a measure of safety for the user in that if the glasses are accidentally knocked from the users head, they do not fall to the ground or floor thereby eliminating potential breakage or loss. This is especially helpful in water sports where a person could loose his or her glasses altogether if they accidentally fall off while swimming, surfing or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Although there are straps currently on the market that help hold a persons glasses so that they don&apos;t fall to the ground during activity, there are a number of deficiencies in current designs. First, there is no means to allow the user to snuggly retain the strap around his or her head so that the glasses are firmly secure on the users head. Secondly, there is no way for the strap to easily break away from the glasses in times of emergency. Thirdly, current straps can&apos;t easily let the attached glasses be stored on the users chest as well as the users back. Finally, current straps can not easily fit snuggly onto glasses with different sized ear piece ends. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiment are provided herein. It is to be understood, however, that the present invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system, structure or manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="7"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Turning first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> we see a side view of a person <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> wearing the eyeglass retaining device of the present invention. The user&apos;s eyeglasses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are retained at the ear piece by resilient tubes <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, one end of which retains the ear piece <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. The other end of which retains a first fastening means <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. Fastening means <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> removably snaps into second fastening means <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> which is in turn connected to retaining strap <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Retaining strap <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is approximately thirty four inches long and proceeds to encircle the users neck. Slidable retaining bead, <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> can be slid all the way to the back of the users head to thereby securely the glasses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the users head during vigorous activity as shown by dotted line <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>. Bead <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> can be adjusted to have the leash <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> fit snuggly but comfortably around the users neck. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is an exploded view of the connection means of the present invention. Ear piece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can snuggly slip into resilient tube <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. Tube <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> can be made out of a material such as surgical rubber tubing. First fastener <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is comprised of a barbed post <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> joined to a universal joint <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Second fastening means <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is comprised of universal joint <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> joined to barbed post <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Universal joint <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> snap together forming a complete universal joint. In times of emergency, if the eyeglasses need to be quickly pulled away from the users body, the prongs <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> can separated from each other thereby allowing the eyeglasses to separate. Other alternate types of known snap type fastening means may be used in place of the universal joint described above, however, the universal joint system described creates a more flexible and adjustable joint that is comfortable for the user. Barbed post <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is inserted into the hollow portion <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> of leash or strap <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. In the preferred embodiment strap <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is made of lycra covered neoprene. The lycra is available in many colors and patterns. The neoprene is one sixteenth of an inch thick and is flexible, resilient and water resistant. The strip of neoprene is folded over and sewn. The resulting tubular strap or leash is then turned inside out so that seam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is in the inner diameter of the strap <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Post <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of second fastener <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> has a slit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> molded into it to accommodate seam <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows a side view of a person <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> wearing the present invention so that the eyeglasses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are resting on the user&apos;s chest. In this configuration the user can have easy access to the glasses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and thereby put them on and take them off while keeping them in close proximity to the user <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows an alternate position where the glasses <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are resting on the user&apos;s <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> back. This position can be helpful when the user <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> wants to have the front portion of his or her body clear of articles. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows a section view of the first fastening means <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> having a small diameter attachment post <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that allows a small diameter tube <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to retain a thin type ear piece <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> shows a similar section view showing an alternate first fastening means <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> having a larger diameter attachment post <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> that allows a larger diameter tube <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> to retain a thicker type ear piece <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The user can select the ideal first fastening means <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> or others, to accommodate his or her eyeglasses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In the above described and illustrated way, a person can wear the eyeglass leash retaining means of the present invention and in doing so can keep the glasses in a convenient location on the users body. The glasses can quickly separate from the leash in times of emergency. A plurality of fasteners can be provided to the user so that the present invention can be snuggly attached to the users eyeglasses regardless of the thickness or thinness of the ear piece. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described in connection with a preferred embodiment, it is not intended to limit the scope of the invention to the particular form set forth, but on the contrary, it is intended to cover such alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>
