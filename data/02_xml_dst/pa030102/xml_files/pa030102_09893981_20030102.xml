<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A system for and a process of controlling power supplied to a group of computers. The power available is determined, and the total power requirement of the group of computers is monitored. When an additional computer joins the group, the new total power requirement is determined. If this exceeds the power available, but the existing group of computers can operate with reduced power and the additional computer can operate with less power than indicated in the request for power, reduced power is provided to each computer of the existing group of computers, and the additional computer is provided with less power than indicated in the request for power. When the existing group of computers or the additional computer can not operate with this reduced power, the total power requirement of the existing plurality of computers is continued to be provided, and only standby power is provided to the additional computer. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention pertains to a process of controlling power supplied to a group of computers in a computer system, and to a computer system including a power controller for controlling power provided to the computers of the system. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Many computer systems provide power from a common power supply to the computers of the system. The power supply has a maximum power capacity. If an additional computer is added to the system, that increases the power requirements of the system. If the new power requirements exceed the maximum power capacity of the power supply, the entire system might shut down. Not only is that undesirable, but in critical circumstances it can lead to catastrophic results. While Universal Serial Bus (USB) may protect a single computer when new peripheral components are added, no protection exists for a computer system when another computer is added to the system.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a computer system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Computer system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> includes a plurality of computers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, . . . <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>each of which receives power from a common power supply <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. One of the computers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>may be a server. A power monitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> determines the power available from power supply <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and monitors the power requirements of the several computers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>. A power controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> controls the power supplied from power supply <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to the computers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>- <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n </italic></highlight>based on the power requirements of the individual computers and the available power from supply <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. Power monitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and power controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> might be a properly programmed digital processing system, for example. Computer system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, including computers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>- <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>, power supply <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, power monitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and power controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, might be contained within a rack <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, such as a bladed rack, permitting ready addition and removal of computers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is a flowchart of a process of controlling power supplied to the computers of a computer system such as computer system <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The process begins in step S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> power monitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> determines the amount of power available from power supply <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. In many computer systems this value is substantially constant and so can be stored within a memory in power controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, power controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> determines whether there has been a new request for power. Such a new request for power might result from an additional computer being added to the group of computers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>. If there is no new request for power, the process waits in step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A new request for power results in a new total power requirement. When a new request for power is detected in step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, then in step S<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, power monitor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> determines the level of that new total power requirement. In step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>, power controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> determines whether the available power as determined in step S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is sufficient to satisfy the new total power requirement. If so, then the process returns to step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. If step S<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> determines that power supply <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can not provide sufficient power to satisfy the new power requirement, then in step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> power controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> determines whether the power provided to the computers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>- <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>, including the new computer, can be reduced, with all of the computers operating at a reduced capacity, for example receiving 75% of their respective usual power requirements. If so, then in step S<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, the power is reduced to all of the computers, including providing the additional computer less power than indicated in its request for power. The process then returns to step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. If step S<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> determines that the power to be supplied to all of the computers <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>- <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>n</italic></highlight>, including the new computer, can not be reduced, then power controller <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> does not change the level of power supplied to the original computers, but does not allow the new computer to operate, instead providing only standby power to the new computer, for example only 2-3% of its usual power requirement. The process then returns to step S<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention thus provides control of power in a computer system, making power readily available to newly added computers when sufficient power is available, while assuring that an existing computer of the system is not made inactive due to a loss of power when an attempt is made to add another computer to the system. Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, various alternations, rearrangements, and substitutions can be made, and still the result will be within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
