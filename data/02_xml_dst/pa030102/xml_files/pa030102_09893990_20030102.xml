<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The online financial software known as Systems Applications and Products (SAP) includes the business data warehouse modules of Logistic Information System (LIS) and Open Information Warehouse (OIW), and an associated reporting module called Executive Information System (EIS) that receives and operates upon data from LIS and OIW. The SAP software is owned by the SAP company in Germany. Unfortunately, data processing using EIS in conjunction with the LIS and OIW modules for generating reports based on large volumes of data is inefficient and prohibitively time consuming. Accordingly, there is a need for a time-efficient method and system for generating reports within SAP. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> is a block diagram of a system <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprising bridge programs, and associated Methodology, for generating a report by the Executive Information System (EIS) <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of the Systems Applications and Products (SAP) software, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. &ldquo;EIS&rdquo;, as referred to herein, includes not only the specific versions of EIS that are currently operational, but also includes all future versions of EIS as well as any other reporting program or module of SAP that is intended to operate on data stored in a business data warehouse. In the preceding context, EIS may be generally viewed as an embodiment of a SAP &ldquo;business information system&rdquo; having reporting capabilities in conjunction with a business data warehouse. The present invention is relevant to any application that uses EIS, including applications involving procurement data, such as purchase order data and invoice data. Other applications may involve, inter alia, financial situations, human resources (e.g., personnel), financial markets (e.g., a stock market or commodity market), individual company stocks and/or bonds, etc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows N datasets denoted as D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , D<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>, wherein N&gE;1. For each i (i.e., for i&equals;1,2, . . . , N), the dataset D<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>is processed by a non-SAP bridge program Pi to generate an Aspect file A<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>which is sent over a data communications network W<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>into an EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> environment in a form T<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>. Definitionally, a data communications network comprises communication lines over which data is trasmitted from one node to another, and each said node may include, inter alia, a computer, a terminal, a communication control unit, etc. A user <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may submit a database query to EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to obtain a report relating to data in any of T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , T<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>individually or to data in any combination of T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , T<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> A dataset is defined as any two dimensional organization of data, or of any two-dimensional projection of a M-dimensional organization of data wherein M&gt;2. As examples, a dataset may be a table, database, spreadsheet, file, two-dimensional array (such as within a computer code or database), etc. As a table, database, spreadsheet, or array, the two-dimensionality of the dataset is expressed in terms of rows and columns. As a file, the two-dimensionality of the dataset is expressed in terms of records and fields. As used herein, the terms &ldquo;row&rdquo; and &ldquo;record&rdquo; are assumed to have the same meaning, and the terms &ldquo;column&rdquo; and &ldquo;field&rdquo; are likewise assumed to have the same meaning. As another example, the dataset may represent two-dimensional projection of the three-dimensional array Z<highlight><subscript>ijk </subscript></highlight>such that the array index k is constant and the array indices i and j vary. The datasets D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , D<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>may independently be a SAP-formatted dataset or a non-SAP-formatted dataset. A SAP-formatted dataset is a dataset that is readable by any program or module of the SAP software. A non-SAP-formatted dataset is a dataset that is not a SAP-formatted dataset. The datasets D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , D<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>have formats F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, F<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , F<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> The datasets D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , D<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>may be stored in any storage medium (hard disk, optical disk, compact disk, magnetic tape, etc.), have any size with regard to number of bytes, be configured in accordance with any operating system on any computing platform (e.g., AIX operating system, VM operating system on VMS platform, etc.), and be located anywhere in the world or in outer space (e.g., in the United States, Europe, South America, Asia, Africa, on a ship or submarine in the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean, in a spacecraft, on the Moon, on Mars, etc.). The datasets D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , D<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>may have been generated through any degree of automation ranging from manual data entry to automatic generation of datasets using sophisticated software such as SAP software. As an example of manual data entry, the data for the dataset may be entered manually into a file on a floppy disk, then into a file on a workstation, then into a spreadsheet template which may be passed through the bridge program Pi to generate the Aspect file A<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>(i&equals;1, 2, . . . , N). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Each non-SAP bridge program P<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>(i&equals;1, 2, . . . , N) is a computer program that is not part of the SAP software and is thus not encumbered by the inefficiencies of SAP modules for processing large amounts of data. The bridge programs P<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, P<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , P<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>are respectively keyed to the formats F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, F<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , F<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>of the datasets D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , D<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>for respectively generating the Aspect files A<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, A<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , A<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>. Alternatively, the bridge programs P<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, P<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , P<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>may be replace by a single bridge program P having logical paths L<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, L<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , L<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>respectively keyed to the formats F<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, F<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , F<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>for respectively generating the Aspect files A<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, A<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , A<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>. The bridge programs P<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, P<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , P<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>(or the single bridge program P) may be any executable form (e.g., object code, source text that can be executed by an interpreter program, a macro, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> An Aspect file is a file that is readable by, and may be processed by, EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> aside for a possible conversion to resolve an incompatibility between the respective operating systems and platforms in which the Aspect file and EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are configured. Thus, the Aspect file has the property that EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> would be able to directly read and process the Aspect file if EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and the Aspect file were functioning on the same computing platform and with the same operating system. As an example, the Aspect files A<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, A<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , A<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>may be generated by the bridge programs P<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, P<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , P<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>(or the single bridge program P) using the VM operating system, while EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be functioning in an AIX operating system environment, and file conversion of Aspect files may thus be required for operating system compatibility purposes. As another example, such Aspect file conversions may be required even if the Aspect file and EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> both operate in accordance with the same operating system (e.g., AIX, UNIX, etc.). Accordingly, the Aspect files A<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, A<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , A<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>, which are respectively sent over the data communications networks W<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, W<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . ,W<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>may be respectively converted into the Temp files T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , T<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>if such conversion is necessary to resolve the operating system incompatibilities discussed supra. Thus, it is to be understood herein that if no such conversions are necessary then T<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>and A<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>(i&equals;1, 2, . . . , N) are the same Aspect file, and if such conversions are necessary then T<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>is a converted form of A<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>due to operating system and/or platform incompatibilities only. The term &ldquo;Temp file&rdquo;, as used herein, covers both of the preceding possibilities and is thus viewed as an Aspect file generated by the non-SAP bridge program of the present invention. Accordingly, the Aspect files are viewed herein as logically readable by EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> since the logical structure of the Aspect files (in terms of records and fields, or rows and columns) is adapted to be read by EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Without the bridge programs of the present invention, a SAP dataset would normally be processed within SAP by going through SAP Logistic Information System (LIS) modules, then through SAP Open Information Warehouse (OIW) modules, and finally into EIS. The preceding path of LIS&rarr;OIW&rarr;EIS is extremely time intensive and thus highly inefficient. In contrast, the bridge programs P<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, P<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , P<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>(or the single bridge program P) of the present invention provide a bridge, or direct shunt from a SAP dataset or a non-SAP dataset into EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> without using LIS or OIW. As will be discussed infra, the bridge program implements filtration and rollup functionality that may drastically reduce the amount of data that is transferred from the datasets D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , D<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>into the Aspect files A<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, A<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , A<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>, respectively. Thus, filtration and rollup by the bridge program significantly reduces the overall processing time for generating a report from EIS. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> With filtration, the bridge program uses &ldquo;selection rules&rdquo; to identify &ldquo;select records&rdquo; of the dataset. A &ldquo;select record&rdquo; is a record of the dataset having data to be inserted into the associated Aspect file. When filtration is used, a dataset record that is not a select record does not contribute data to the Aspect file. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> illustrates a dataset having 15 records with records 1-2, 5-7, 9, and 13-14 identified by an adjacent asterisk (*) as being select records. The selection rules determine which records of the dataset are select records. A selection rule typically performs logical and/or arithmetic operations on the data in one or more fields of a records and the outcome or result of said logical and/or arithmetic operations determines whether or not the record is a select record. An example of a selection rule is that of &ldquo;date screening.&rdquo; With date screening, the records of the dataset have a field that includes an effective date (e.g., the date at which a purchase order was placed, wherein the records of the dataset contain information concerning purchase orders). The &ldquo;date screening&rdquo; selection rule states that for a given first date DATE<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and second date DATE<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, such that DATE<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>is earlier than DATE<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, a record is identified as a select record if its effective date is not earlier than DATE<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and not later than DATE<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Conversely, the record is not a select record if its effective date is earlier than DATE<highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>or later than DATE<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. Another example of a selection rule is with records that include invoice data, wherein the selection rule examines the contents of a field to determine whether the invoice associated with the record is a canceled invoice. A selection rule can be very complex and involve multiple fields and/or multiple operations on the fields. Virtually any desired combination of logical and/or arithmetic operations can be used to form a selection rule. Another selection rule could involve testing macroscopic characteristics of a record instead of data in fields of the record (e.g., rejecting records whose length exceed a predetermined number of bytes). The selection rule may be in any programmable form such as executing a logical statement, calling a subroutine or subprogram that performs a test that implements the selection rule, testing data in record fields against a readout of a hardware device as a system clock or an inline measurement instrument (e.g., a voltmeter, a pressure transducer, etc.). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> illustrate how the bridge program performs rollup functionality. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> illustrates a dataset table of raw data having 5 columns (or fields) and 22 rows (or records) as indicated. The dataset table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> stores purchase order records of a paint distributor company having three divisions (100, 200, 300) and the company purchases paint for distribution to customers in two paint colors (white and blue). The fields are Purchase Order No., Vendor, Division, Color, and Buyer. Vendor (A, B, or C) denotes from whom the paint was to be purchased, and Buyer denotes the person in the company who made the purchase order. The dataset table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> constitutes the select records of a dataset of raw records if filtration has been performed, or the entire dataset of raw records if filtration has not been performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The Division and Color fields collectively constitute a &ldquo;keygroup&rdquo; which is used for sorting and rolling up. A keygroup generally comprises one or more fields, and said fields of the keygroup are not required to be contiguously distributed along the record length. Each combination of data of the keygroup of each record of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is called a &ldquo;keyvalue.&rdquo; Each unique combination of data in the keygroups of the records of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is called a &ldquo;rollup keyvalue.&rdquo; <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> shows 6 rollup keyvalues, namely: (100, blue); (100, white); (200, blue); (200, white); (300, blue); (300, white). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The 6 rollup keyvalues are clearly seen after a sort is performed on the table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, using the first keygroup component (Division) as the primary sort key, and the second keygroup component (Color) as the secondary sort key. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows the result of the aforementioned sort with an organized arrangement of the 6 rollup keyvalues. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> shows the table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> as &ldquo;rolled up.&rdquo; The operation of rolling up comprises eliminating records of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> that have redundant keyvalues, so that the records of the rolled up table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> each have a rollup keyvalue that uniquely identifies each record and thus distinguishes each record from every other record. The rollup table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> has several features. First, each record of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> has a unique rollup keyvalue, as discussed supra. Second, the Purchase Order No. field and the Buyer field were eliminated, because these eliminated fields are not needed for subsequent data processing by the EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Third, the Vendor field is retained in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, wherein the Vendor value appearing in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is the Vendor value in those records of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> that are also present in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Even if the Vendor value is not needed for subsequent data processing by the EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it is nonetheless permissible to retain the Vendor field as is done in the rolled up table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Accordingly, an absence in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> of some of the Vendor values that appears in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference> will not adversely impact subsequent data processing by the EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Alternatively, the Vendor field could have been eliminated from the rolled up table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> as were the Purchase Order No. field and Buyer field. Note that for the records in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> having redundant keyvalues, the first-appearing such record for each rollup keyvalue has been retained for placement in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. Fourth, an added Quantity field in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> stores the number of records in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> having the same rollup keyvalue. The records of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> are called &ldquo;rollup records,&rdquo; and the table of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> exemplifies the Aspect file having the rollup records. Note that the rollup records in the generated Aspect file of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> are sorted with respect to the keygroup (i.e., with respect to keyvalues of the keygroup). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In summary, given a dataset of raw records, generating the Aspect file having rollup records comprises rolling up a &ldquo;portion&rdquo; of the dataset of raw records with respect to the keygroup (e.g., the keygroup Division, Color in the preceding example), which 1) eliminates raw records having redundant keyvalues; and 2) includes within each rollup record of the Aspect file a &ldquo;rollup&rdquo; field and &ldquo;quantity&rdquo; field, wherein the rollup field stores a rollup keyvalue of the keygroup, and wherein the quantity field stores the number of dataset records in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> that have the same rollup keyvalue. Note that said &ldquo;portion&rdquo; of the dataset of raw records constitutes the select records of the dataset of raw records if filtration has been performed, or the entire dataset of raw records if filtration has not been performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The preceding discussion described filtration and rolling up for using a single dataset to generate a single Aspect file. The following discussion describes analogous notation for applying filtration and rolling up to the N datasets D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , D<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>(N&gE;2) in the generation of the N Aspect files A<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, A<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , A<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>, respectively, such that the Aspect files A<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, A<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , A<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>have rollup records &lsqb;R&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, &lsqb;R&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , &lsqb;R&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>. The datasets D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , D<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>having a common keygroup. For i&equals;1, 2, . . . , and N, the non-SAP bridge program is executed to identify select records &lsqb;S&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>of the dataset D<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, in accordance with selection rules applied to D<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>. The selection rules may be the same for each of the N datasets, or may differ for each of the N datasets. The rollup records &lsqb;R&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>corresponding to &lsqb;S&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>have a rollup field and a quantity field. The rollup field stores a rollup keyvalue of the select records &lsqb;S&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>i</subscript></highlight>, and the quantity field stores the number of select records of &lsqb;S&rsqb;<highlight><subscript>i </subscript></highlight>that have the same rollup keyvalue. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Returning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it is recalled that the Aspect files A<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, A<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , A<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>are transmitted to EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> where the Aspect files are the Temp files T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , T<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>, respectively. The Aspect files and the Temp files are the same structurally (i.e., the same as to records and fields and data therein), as explained supra. Thus, the Aspect files and the Temp files have the same rollup records. The user <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> may make a query, such as to sum over the quantity field for a subset of the rollup records of one or more of the Temp files. The query may be any database query that is intended to access the Temp files. The pertinent subset of the rollup records is determined by the query itself, since the query limits the scope of the data that is required to return a result of the query, as is typical with database queries. The query is executed by a SAP module, namely EIS, in the SAP computing environment. Such execution by EIS returns a result of the query to the user <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Filtration and rollup, as implemented by the bridge programs P<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, P<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , P<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>(or the bridge program P) may drastically reduce the amount of data that is transferred from the datasets D<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, D<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , D<highlight><subscript>N </subscript></highlight>into the Aspect files A<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>, A<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>, . . . , A<highlight><subscript>N</subscript></highlight>, respectively (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>). Thus, only a small percentage of data from the raw datasets may propagate to the Temp files at EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, resulting in substantial reductions in processing time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> The bridge program is further adapted to generate a &ldquo;trace file&rdquo; for debugging purposes. For example, if the user <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> makes a query to EIS <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and notices an anomalous result, such as an invoice that is outstanding for 9999 days (i.e., 27 years), then the user <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> would suspect that an error has occurred and would desire to find the source of the error. The rolling Up process, however, may result in eliminating fields (e.g., invoice number, invoice date, etc.) of the raw dataset in the Aspect file, wherein said fields may be required or beneficial for tracing back to the raw dataset where the error may have originated. Fortunately, the trace file of the present invention makes it possible to trace back from the Aspect file to the associated raw dataset. In particular, the trace file includes a representative rollup keyvalue of the keygroup that is stored in the Aspect file and is common to the raw dataset. The trace file also includes a pointer that points to a portion of the raw dataset that is correlated with the representative rollup keyvalue. For example, the pointer may be a representative invoice number or a representative invoice date. Accordingly, the information in the trace file may not point to exactly where in the raw dataset the problematic invoice is, but will nonetheless point to a nearby portion of the raw dataset. Thus, the nearby portion of the raw dataset is effectively correlated with the representative rollup keyvalue through the pointer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> lists the fields of an exemplary Aspect file that contains blocked invoices, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. A blocked invoice is an invoice that has been submitted by an entity (e.g., company) for payment by a supplier, but the invoice contains information (relating to price, quantity, taxes, receipt of goods, etc.) that is inconsistent with an associated purchase order previously issued by the entity to the supplier. The blocked invoice may be flagged for manual attention to determine the reason for the inconsistency. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, the &ldquo;Data Type&rdquo; includes a specification of the number of characters in the field (e.g., 003, 001, etc.), and the &ldquo;Source&rdquo; is a table name or file name identifying where the data for the field is located.
