<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention is related to a lamp shade structure which can be DIY replaceably assembled by a user. The respective components of the lamp shade can be separated from each other to facilitate transferring and storage. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> There are various kinds of conventional domestic lamps having lamp shades. The lamp shades are designed with poor structures having shortcomings as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> 1. The conventional lamp shade is integrally formed or made by welding. When it is desired to change the appearance of the lamp shade, it is necessary to purchase another. This is not economic. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. The conventional lamp shades have basically identical frame structures without novel design. Such frame structures has a certain structural strength. However, they are connected by welding and cannot be disassembled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> 3. The conventional lamp shade has an integrally formed frame. A fabric or paper-made cover sheet is laid on the frame. Such lamp shade has a considerably large volume which makes it difficult to store or transfer a number of lamp shades even the lamp shades are stacked. This leads to increased cost for transferring. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Please refer to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>. The lamp shade structure of the present invention includes assembling buckles <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, shade bodies <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a tray body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Each assembling buckle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> has a decorative board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a cooperative stop plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The decorative board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> freely has different patterns. The end face of the decorative board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> facing the stop plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed with projecting connecting posts <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>. The stop plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is formed with a central latch channel <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> with C-shaped cross-section. The opening of the latch channel <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> faces the decorative board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Two wings <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> respectively laterally extends from two sides of the latch channels <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight>. Bach wing <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is formed with a through hole <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. When assembled, the connecting post <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> is passed through the through hole and engaged therein. The stop plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has different structural patterns according to different connecting positions as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</cross-reference>. In the case that the assembling buckle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is positioned on upper side of the lamp shade, an engaging post <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> with C-shaped cross-section projects from the close face of the latch channel <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> of the stop plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. In the case of lower side, there is no such engaging post <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The assembling buckle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is made of flexible material such as plastic or rubber material for more tightly attaching to the shade body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The shade body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is made of metal rod and cooperative fabric or paper material and serves to prevent the light from diverging so as to concentrate the light. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The tray body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> has three bent links <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> projecting from the periphery thereof and containing three angles. The links <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be inserted into the engaging post <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the assembling buckle <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to form a firm and stable frame. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> When assembled, the shade bodies <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are placed side by side and fixedly assembled with each other by the assembling buckles <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The adjacent edges of two shade bodies <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are fixedly inserted into the C-shaped latch channel <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> of the stop plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and then the decorative board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is attached thereto. The connecting posts <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight> are fitted into the through holes <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> of the wings <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the stop plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to integrally associate the decorative board <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> with the stop plate <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> so as to firmly clamp the shade body <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. Such procedure is repeated so that all the shade bodies are assembled to form a lamp shade pattern. Then, the links <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the tray body <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> are fixedly inserted and located in the engaging posts <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> of the stop plates <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to make the entire lamp shade structure more rigid without deformation as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3, 4</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The lamp shade can be DIY replaceably assembled by a user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, prior to assembly, the assembling buckles <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and shade bodies <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are separate bodies so that they can be collectively stored to minimize the volume of the lamp shade. In the case of mass-production, the respective components are collected and stored so as to facilitate transferring. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The above embodiments are only used to illustrate the present invention, not intended to limit the scope thereof. Many modifications of the above embodiments can be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention. </paragraph>
