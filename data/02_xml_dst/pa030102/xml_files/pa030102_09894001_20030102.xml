<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> (1) Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The invention relates to an apparatus for detecting a brake oil level and for controlling engine operation, and more particularly applied to a brake oil cup which includes a porous buoyant plate for stabilizing the oil level, a trident detecting wiring for providing accurate detecting signals, and a detecting circuitry having a yellow flicker light for particularly alarming. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> (2) Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> In both U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,501,294 and 5,785,142, the applicant same as the one for the present invention introduces a brake oil lever safety device for motor. Either of above patents mainly discloses a teaching to construct a detecting wiring in the brake oil cup for detecting the level of the brake oil. By providing the detecting wiring, a control circuitry can issue a green light, a yellow light or a red light to attract the driver&apos;s attention upon the level of the brake oil. Once the level in the oil cup is below a safety lower limit, the control circuitry can interrupt the ignition system for stopping the operation of the engine. Thereby, dysfunction of the braking system caused by deficiency of brake oil while in engine rung can thus be avoided. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Nevertheless, at least three practical shortcomings of said patents, as follows, exist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> 1. A fault oil level might be detected in the case that the oil inside the oil cup waves violently while the vehicle is driven. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> 2. The reliability of the detecting signals is doubt because three wires of the detecting wiring are separately mounted inside the oil cup and also the oil level fluctuates all the time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> 3. The yellow light of the detecting circuitry for symbolizing an urgent requirement of oil refilling or inspection is not so eye-catching to meet its particular purpose. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for detecting brake oil level and controlling engine operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> To resolve the waving problem in the oil cup, the apparatus in accordance with the present invention provides a buoyant plate to the oil level of the brake oil cup. The buoyant plate includes a plurality of holes for reducing the waving inside the oil cup, so that the oil level can be kept more stably and thus the oil level can be detected more accurately. In addition, to resolve the problem caused by the mounting of those three detecting wires, the present invention integrates those three wires onto a triangular pillar. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The triangular pillar, made of an insulating material, provides three lateral sides to adhere respective conductive components. Thereby, the sensing area of the detecting circuitry can be shrunk and a more accurate oil level can be detected. Furthermore, the detecting circuitry is improved to have the yellow light flickered. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> All these objects are achieved by the apparatus for detecting brake oil level and controlling engine operation described below.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The invention disclosed herein is directed to an apparatus for detecting brake oil level and controlling engine operation. In the following description, numerous details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that variations of these specific details are possible while still achieving the results of the present invention. In other instance, well-known components are not described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B, a</cross-reference> buoyant plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of the present invention is included to be floated inside an oil cup <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. The buoyant plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as shown has a plurality of holes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. While the oil surface <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> inside the oil cup <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> waves along with the shaking of driving a vehicle, the turbulent wave can be substantially diminished by acting with those holes <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the buoyant plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. By providing the buoyant plate <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> floating stably upon the oil, the variation of the oil level due to any forcing can be reduced to a substantial degree. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A and <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the detecting wiring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the oil level is shown to be constructed at a triangular pillar <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. The pillar <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can be made of a corrosion-proof insulating material as the glass for example. The triangular pillar <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provides three lateral sides <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> for adhering respective conductive components <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> with different lengths. The conductive components <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> can be made of an aluminum foil, a cupper foil, a silver foil or any material the like. The detecting wiring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the oil level can be installed at a proper place inside the oil cup <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>B, the detecting wiring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is mounted close to a wall <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> of the oil cup <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, preferably to be mounted at a center of the oil cup <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Upon such an arrangement, the sensing area of the detecting wiring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> can be limited to a small stable area and thus a more accurate oil level can be provided by the conductive components <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3, a</cross-reference> preferred embodiment of a detecting circuitry of the brake oil level is shown. As shown, E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are an upper and a lower conductive components of the detecting wiring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, respectively. E<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is a ground component of the detecting wiring <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The upper conductive component E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and the lower conductive component E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> are respectively connected to a first gate U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a second gate U<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. A first illuminating diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is a yellow-light diode connected with an output port of the first gate U<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. A second illuminating diode D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a red-light diode connected to an output port of a third gate U<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> through a transistor Q. In the case that the oil level inside the oil cup <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is normal, an operational panel can display a green background light. In the case that the oil level is detected between an upper limit provided by E<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a lower limit provided by E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the first illuminating diode D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can be started to emit flickered yellow light. In the case that the oil level is lower than the conductive component E<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, the second illuminating diode D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> can be started to emit red light and also the transistor Q and the relay RL will be triggered to disconnect the power of the ignition system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
