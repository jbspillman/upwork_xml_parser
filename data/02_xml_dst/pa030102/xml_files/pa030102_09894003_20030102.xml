<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A disc case comprises a pair of opposite latches in a container member each having a latched piece coupled to an upward free end of the latch being extended outwardly and a flexible bridge interconnected the free ends of the latches for forming an integral member. In loading/unloading a disc simply press latches down to cause free ends of latches to draw toward each other uniformly with bridge bent downwardly. This eliminates conventional problems of different inward moving distance of latches, latched pieces squeezed by disc, and disc scrape or even damage when a base of either latch is broken. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A conventional case for storing VCD, DVD, CD, LD, or the like comprises a container member; a cover extended from one side of container member; a pair of opposite latches in container member each having a base in one end coupled to the bottom of container member, a latched piece coupled to the other free end of latch being extended outwardly, and a recess at the joining of latched piece and latch; and a ring shaped flange concentric with latches wherein the height of flange is the same as that of latched piece and the radius of flange is smaller or less than that of disc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> In a loading operation of disc, user may press latches down. Then load disc in the container member with disc rested on flange. Then release latches to lock disc by latched pieces as latched pieces bounce up by the stored elastic force of the returning latches. However, the previous design suffered from several disadvantages. For example, two latches are opposite but without being coupled together. Hence, the inward moving distance of one latch may be different from that of the other latch when latches are drawn toward each other. This is because force applied on one latch by finger(s) is different from that applied on the other latch due to different sized fingers. This can cause latched pieces to be squeezed by the central hole of disc. As an end, it is very difficult to remove disc therefrom. Further, a scrape may be formed on disc or even disc is damaged when base of either latch is broken. Thus, it is desirable to provide an improved disc case in order to overcome the above drawbacks of prior art. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is shown a disc case in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the invention for storing VCD, DVD, CD, LD, or the like. The case comprises a rectangular container member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a corresponding rectangular cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extended from one side of container member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> wherein cover <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is bendable to close or open container member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A pair of opposite latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are provided in container member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Each latch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> comprises a base <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> in one end coupled to the bottom of container member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a latched piece <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> coupled to the other upward free end <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of latch <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> being extended outwardly, a recess <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at the joining of latched piece <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and latch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Also, a flexible bridge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> interconnects the top edges of free ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for forming an integral arch member. While it is appreciated by those skilled in the art that such arch member may be replaced by another suitably shaped member without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. Further, a ring shaped flange <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is provided concentric with latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The height of flange <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is the same as that of latched piece <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and the radius of flange <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is smaller or less than that of disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). The provision of flange <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may prevent disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from contacting the bottom of container member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> while resting on flange <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Additionally, first walls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> are provided on two opposite sides of container member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and a second wall <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> is provided on a side opposite to the side having the extended cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. A recessed portion <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> is formed on second wall <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. A recessed portion <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> formed on a side wall of cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is disposed corresponding to recessed portion <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight>. A substantially <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>-degree bent frame member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is formed on either end of recessed portion <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> (i.e., on the corner of cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>). Each frame member <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is capable of engaging with the outer surface of a joining of first wall <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and second wall <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Hence, in closing container member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, user may close cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to cause frame members <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to cling onto first and second walls <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. To the contrary in opening cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, user may first put a finger on a gap between recessed portions <highlight><bold>111</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>131</bold></highlight> prior to pulling cover <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> up. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, there is shown a disc case of a second preferred embodiment of the invention. The difference between first and second preferred embodiments is that a flexible bridge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> interconnects the bottom edges <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of free ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> for forming an integral member also. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the operations of loading and unloading of disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> will now be described below. In a loading of disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, user may first press latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> down to cause the free ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to draw toward each other with bridge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> bent downwardly. Then put the center hole <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> around latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> with disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> rested on flange <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Then release latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to cause them to expand outwardly by the stored elastic force thereof and bridge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. As a result, the edge of center hole <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is clamped by latched pieces <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>, thus securing disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. To the contrary in an unloading of disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, user may first press latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> down to cause the free ends <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> of latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to draw toward each other with bridge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> bent downwardly, thus disengaging the center hole <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from latched pieces <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight>. As a result, user may successfully remove disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from container member <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> thereafter. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In brief, by utilizing such integrally formed bridge <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, it is possible of loading/unloading the disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in a smooth convenient manner. Moreover, above conventional problems, i.e., two latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are opposite but without being coupled together; the inward moving distance of one latch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is different from that of the other latch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when latches <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are drawn toward each other (because force applied on one latch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by finger(s) is different from that applied on the other latch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> due to different sized fingers); latched pieces <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> are squeezed by the central hole <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>; difficult to remove disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> from case; and a scrape is formed on disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> or even disc <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> is damaged when base <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> of either latch <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is broken are substantially eliminated by the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been described by means of specific embodiments, numerous modifications and variations could be made thereto by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention set forth in the claims. </paragraph>
