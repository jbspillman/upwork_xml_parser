<heading lvl="1">TECHNICAL FIELD </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> These teachings relate generally to methods and apparatus for providing network selection for mobile terminals, such as cellular telephones, and more specifically relates to techniques for performing mobile station background scanning. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Background scanning is used by several network selection algorithms to enable a mobile station to periodically search for another network. The search can be guided by a number of different criteria set by the network operator and/or by the user. As an example, if a user employs network operator &num;1 to obtain their service, and if the mobile station is powered up in an area where only network operator &num;2 is available, the mobile station will register with and camp on a channel of network operator &num;2. However, the mobile station may periodically leave the channel to network operator &num;2 to search or scan for a channel provided by network operator &num;1. This type of operation is typically performed as a background task, and hence can be referred to as background scanning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Background scanning is very different than cell reselection operations. In cell reselection the mobile station typically scans neighbor cells belonging to the currently selected network operator to locate a cell to which it may immediately, or in the future, hand-off to. A list of neighbor cells to be scanned can be provided by the network and transmitted to the mobile station, and the mobile station may report the results of the neighbor cell scanning operation back to the network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Background scanning, in contradistinction, provides a mechanism for a primary network operator of the mobile station to force the mobile station to a higher priority network when it is camped on a lower priority network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Background scanning also involves the mobile station temporarily losing service on the currently registered channel, without the knowledge of the network operator, so that the mobile station can re-tune its receiver to scan for another network operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> There are two primary problems with background scanning as it is currently performed. The first problem results from the mobile station leaving the registered channel to evaluate other channels in its search for a better network. During the period of time that the mobile station is evaluating other channels, it will miss any messages sent by the base station to which the mobile station is registered sends. This means that the mobile station will miss, by example, pages, short message service (SMS) messages and authentication during background scanning. The second problem results from the periodicity of the background scanning. Since the mobile station will periodically search for better networks while it would normally be camped with its transmitter, digital signal processor (DSP) and central processor unit (CPU) powered down in a sleep mode, the background scanning results in a reduction in battery life. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the number of background scans that the mobile station perform without locating a better network. This problem is further aggravated by the fact that in some areas there is no better network available. As such, the power consuming background scanning operations will fail to find better service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> If the severity of this problem is reduced by simply increasing the time between background scans, the mobile station is required to reside on a low priority network for a longer period of time. A problem with this situation is that it is possible for the mobile station to camp on a network that does not allow it to receive calls, or that does not allow the mobile station access to desired services. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thus, in these situations it is imperative that the background scans occur frequently in order to reduce the period without service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Currently, the decision to enable background scanning is made in the mobile station based upon network identification parameters. Therefore, for time division, multiple access (TDMA) networks, the decision to perform a background scan is based on the System Identifier Code (SID) and the System Operator Code (SOC). These parameters can provide the mobile station with enough information to determine which market (network operator) the mobile station is currently camped on. For example, the mobile station can determine that it is currently located in some metropolitan area. Therefore, if a situation exits where, within the overall metropolitan area, there is one small area (perhaps a border with another market area) that has a higher priority network, the background scanning will be performed within the entire metropolitan area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The decision to enable background scanning for GSM-type networks is based on the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN), which gives the identification of the operator and the country. This means that, if a situation exists where, within the United States, there is one small area (perhaps a border with another market area) that has a higher priority, background scanning will be performed in the entire United States. In many cases, forcing background scanning on such a broad scale will result in a very high percentage of unproductive background scans. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The mobile station might possibly add location area parameters to its local database to provide finer granularity, but the resulting database would be several orders of magnitude larger than the current database. Furthermore, these finer location parameters would be controlled only within the operator&apos;s business area. Therefore, these location area parameters could change at any time. If these parameters are stored within the mobile station&apos;s database, the operator would be required to update the database of every mobile station each time the location parameters changed. With such a large required database, there would be a resulting very large amount of bandwidth utilized for just providing the frequent database updates. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, there is illustrated a simplified block diagram of an embodiment of a wireless communications system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> that is suitable for practicing this invention. The wireless communications system <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> includes at least one mobile station (MS) <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also shows an exemplary first network operator (network operator &num;1) having, for example, a GPRS Support Node (GSN) <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> for connecting to a telecommunications network, such as a Public Packet Data Network or PDN, at least one base station controller (BSC) <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, and a plurality of base transceiver stations (BTS) <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that transmit in a forward or downlink direction both physical and logical channels to the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in accordance with a predetermined air interface standard. In general, one BTS <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will provide a serving cell for the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and one or more other BTS <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> will service a neighboring cell or cells. A reverse or uplink communication path also exists from the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to the network operator, which conveys mobile originated access requests and traffic. In an idle mode, the mobile station will be camped on a channel of the BTS <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the serving cell. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> In a preferred, but not limiting, embodiment of these teachings, the air interface standard can conform to any standard that enables voice and/or data transmissions to occur to the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, such as data transmissions enabling Internet 70 access and web page downloads. In one embodiment of this invention the air interface standard is a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) air interface that supports a GSM or an advanced GSM protocol and air interface, although these teachings are not intended to be limited to TDMA or to GSM or GSM-related wireless systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The first network operator may also include a Message Center (MC) <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> that receives and forwards messages for the mobile stations <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. Other types of messaging service may include Supplementary Data Services and one under currently development and known as Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), wherein image messages, video messages, audio messages, text messages, executables and the like, and combinations thereof, can be transferred between the network and the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Service from a second network operator (network operator &num;2) may also be present in the geographical area that contains the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, and the second network operator may or may not be a higher priority network operator than network operator &num;1. The network operator &num;2 mat provide the same, more, or fewer services than network operator &num;1. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> typically includes a data processor such as a microcontrol unit (MCU) <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> having an output coupled to an input of a display <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and an input coupled to an output of a keyboard or keypad <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>. The mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> may be a handheld radiotelephone, such as a cellular telephone or a personal communicator. The mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> could also be contained within a card or module that is connected during use to another device. For example, the mobile station <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> could be contained within a PCMCIA or similar type of card or module that is installed during use within a portable data processor, such as a laptop or notebook computer, or even a computer that is wearable by the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The MCU <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> is assumed to include or be coupled to some type of a memory <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, including a read-only memory (ROM) for storing an operating program, as well as a random access memory (RAM) for temporarily storing required data, scratchpad memory, received data, data to be transmitted and the like. A separate, removable SIM (not shown) can be provided as well, the SIM storing, for example, a preferred Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) list and other subscriber-related information. The ROM is assumed, for the purposes of this invention, to store a program enabling the MCU <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> to execute the software routines, layers and protocols required to perform background scanning in accordance with these teachings, as well as to provide a suitable user interface (UI), via display <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and keypad <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, with a user. Although not shown, a microphone and speaker are typically provided for enabling the user to conduct voice calls in a conventional manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also contains a wireless section that includes a digital signal processor (DSP) <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight>, or equivalent high speed processor, as well as a wireless transceiver that includes a transmitter <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> and a receiver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight>, both of which are coupled to an antenna <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight> for communication with the network operator. At least one local oscillator (LO) <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight>, such as a frequency synthesizer, is provided for tuning the transceiver. Data, such as digitized voice data and/or packet data, is transmitted and received through the antenna <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. The mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> also receives certain network-related data from the network operator, including network operator originated data, in accordance with these teachings, that provides the improved mobile station background scanning function. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> These teachings enable the network operator, such as the network operator &num;1 in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, to provide direct guidance in background scanning decisions that is specific to the current area that the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is located in. Since the area serviced by a base station, such as the serving BTS <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, is known to the network operator &num;1, this enhanced position information is used to determine whether the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is on the network that has the best roaming agreement in that area. If the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is on the best network that is available to it in that area, the network operator &num;1 is enabled to send a message to the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that directs the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to disable background scanning while in this area. The definition of the area may be based on the location area parameter, a SID, SOC and/or digital verification color code (dvcc), or on some other combination of parameters, including the PLMN. If the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is located within an area where it can select a better network (based at least in part upon the network operator&apos;s business arrangements with other network operators, such as roaming agreements), the network operator &num;1 sends a message to the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to enable or even expedite background scanning. Furthermore, the network operator &num;1 may determine which frequency band, or possibly a channel number, that the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> would most likely find the better service, and transmits this information as well. This information may be referred to as background scanning control parameters (BSCP), and it is received by the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and stored in the memory <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> in a BSCP block <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A, as is shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> An example is now provided of these network assisted background scanning teachings. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, assume that there are two network operators, such as the network operators &num;1 and &num;2 of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, who have mutual roaming agreements. Assume further that there are areas where these network operators are not in competition with each other (areas where there is no overlap in coverage) and at least one area where these network operators are in competition with each other (in an area where there is coverage overlap). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> If the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> has Operator B as its primary service provider, Operator B will wish to ensure that the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is using Operator B&apos;s network whenever possible, and is only using Operator A&apos;s network when there is no Operator B service available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> With current methods for determining when to perform background scanning, there are two behaviors that Operator B can dictate for the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> when the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is in the coverage area of Operator A. Operator B can set up the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> database to force the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to do one of the following things when camped upon Operator A&apos;s network: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> 1) Remain camped upon Operator A&apos;s network and do not look for a higher priority network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> 2) Remain camped upon Operator A&apos;s network, but perform background scanning to attempt to locate a higher priority network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> However, there are problems associated with both of these directives. The problem with directive <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is that, if the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> happens to select Operator A&apos;s network in the area where both Operator A and Operator B provide service, the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will not transition to Operator B&apos;s network. This clearly would violate Operator B&apos;s network selection intent. The problem with directive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is that, if the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is in area A where there is no Operator B network present, the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> will continually perform background scanning when there is no chance of finding a higher priority system. Although Operator B&apos;s network selection intent is preserved in this scenario, the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> still suffers from all of the drawbacks of background scanning, e.g., increased probability of missing pages and other messages, as well as increased power consumption, while having no chance of successfully locating the higher priority network operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> These teachings beneficially enable the mobile station&apos;s home network to send specific background scanning guidelines to the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> when the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is camped on a &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; network (friendly implies that there is some agreement in place that allows the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to use the network it is camped upon for service). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Therefore, assuming that the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is given directive <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, Operator A&apos;s network may send a message to the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> when the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is camped on Operator A&apos;s network in the overlap area where both Operator A and Operator B have coverage. This message may contain an order to perform background scanning to find Operator B&apos;s network. Furthermore, this message may contain information to instruct the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> as to exactly which license block (i.e., set of frequencies, such as those in the 800 MHz or the 1900 MHz band), or even which channel number, to search when attempting to locate Operator B&apos;s network. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Likewise, assuming that the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is given directive <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, Operator A&apos;s network may send a message to the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> when the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is camped upon Operator A&apos;s network in the area where there is no Operator B network present. This message may contain an order for the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to disable background scanning, thus avoiding the negative aspects of performing background scanning when there is no chance of success. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Based on the foregoing it should be appreciated that these teachings provide a method for the network operator to control background scanning based upon information related to the mobile station, such as the location of the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, as well as on relationships that the network operator has with other network operators. These teachings also enable the use of finer mobile station location granularity to determine when the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> should perform background scanning, as well as when background scanning should be inhibited. Relatedly, these teachings provide a centralized database (DB <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A) that is used by a network data processor (DP) <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>B to determine when to perform background scanning, instead of relying a databases that are distributed among the mobile stations <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> that are supported by the network operator. As such, changes that are made to database <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A do not need to be transmitted to the mobile stations <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, thereby conserving bandwidth, as well as mobile station power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is a logic flow diagram that is exemplary of these teachings. At Block A the currently serving network operator determines the location of the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. The location information can be derived from the location of the BTS <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> that is presently serving the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, or even finer location information can be obtained such as by triangulating the mobile station&apos;s location using multiple BTSs <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, and/or by using time alignment data, or by any suitable technique. It is also within the scope of these teachings to query the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to send its position, which could be derived from Global Satellite Positioning (GPS) data, or from the mobile station user entering position-related information (e.g., corner of Main Street and Elm Street). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> At Block B the network operator accesses the database <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A and, in accordance with the determined location of the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, make a further determination if the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is located in the service area of another network operator with which the serving network operator has a satisfactory business relationship (e.g., a roaming agreement). That is, a determination is made if the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is located in the overlap coverage area with an acceptable system operator, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. If this is the case, the serving network operator transmits at Block C a message or messages to the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for informing the mobile station of the background scanning control parameters <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A corresponding to the current location of the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>. As was discussed above, the background scanning control parameters <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>A may include a range of channels, or a specific channel and/or any other information that would aid the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> in locating the other network operator. In response, the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, at Block D, retunes its receiver <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to attempt to access the other network operator, and eventually may gain service from the other network operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> If a check of the database <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>A at Block B does not find that the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is located where service can be obtained from an acceptable network operator, or if no other network operator is available, then the serving network operator transmits at Block E a message or messages to the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> for disabling the background scanning function. In response, at Block F the mobile station <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> inhibits background scanning. </paragraph>
