<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> Without limiting the scope of the present invention, its background is described with reference to the production of hydrocarbon fluids through a wellbore traversing an unconsolidated or loosely consolidated formation, as an example. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> It is well known in the subterranean well drilling and completion art that particulate materials such as sand may be produced during the production of hydrocarbons from a well traversing an unconsolidated or loosely consolidated subterranean formation. Numerous problems may occur as a result of the production of such particulate. For example, the particulate cause abrasive wear to components within the well, such as tubing, pumps and valves. In addition, the particulate may partially or fully clog the well creating the need for an expensive workover. Also, if the particulate matter is produced to the surface, it must be removed from the hydrocarbon fluids by processing equipment at the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> One method for preventing the production of such particulate material to the surface is gravel packing the well adjacent to the unconsolidated or loosely consolidated production interval. In a typical gravel pack completion, a sand control screen is lowered into the wellbore on a work string to a position proximate the desired production interval. A fluid slurry including a liquid carrier and a particulate material known as gravel is then pumped down the work string and into the well annulus formed between the sand control screen and the perforated well casing or open hole production zone. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> The liquid carrier either flows into the formation or returns to the surface by flowing through the sand control screen or both. In either case, the gravel is deposited around the sand control screen to form a gravel pack, which is highly permeable to the flow of hydrocarbon fluids but blocks the flow of the particulate carried in the hydrocarbon fluids. As such, gravel packs can successfully prevent the problems associated with the production of particulate materials from the formation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It has been found, however, that a complete gravel pack of the desired production interval is difficult to achieve particularly in long or inclined/horizontal production intervals. These incomplete packs are commonly a result of the liquid carrier entering a permeable portion of the production interval causing the gravel to form a sand bridge in the annulus. Thereafter, the sand bridge prevents the slurry from flowing to the remainder of the annulus which, in turn, prevents the placement of sufficient gravel in the remainder of the annulus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Prior art devices and methods have been developed which attempt to overcome this sand bridge problem. For example, attempts have been made to use devices having perforated shunt tubes or bypass conduits that extend along the length of the sand control screen to provide an alternate path for the fluid slurry around the sand bridge. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It has been found, however, that shunt tubes installed on the exterior of sand control screens are susceptible to damage during installation and may fail during a gravel packing operation. In addition, it has been found that on site assembly of a shunt tube system around a sand control screen is difficult and time consuming due to the large number of fluid connections required for typical production intervals. Further, it has been found that the effective screen area available for filtering out particulate from the production fluids is reduced when shunt tubes are installed on the exterior of a sand control screen. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Therefore a need has arisen for an apparatus and method for gravel packing a production interval traversed by a wellbore that overcomes the problems created by sand bridges. A need has also arisen for such an apparatus that is not susceptible to damage during installation and will not fail during a gravel packing operation. Additionally, a need has arisen for such an apparatus that is cost effective and does not require difficult or time consuming on site assembly. Further, a need has arisen for such an apparatus that does not require a reduction in the effective screen area available for filtering out particulate from the production fluids. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention disclosed herein comprises a screen assembly and method for gravel packing a production interval of a wellbore that traverses an unconsolidated or loosely consolidated formation that overcomes the problems created by the development of a sand bridge between a sand control screen and the wellbore. Importantly, the screen assembly of the present invention is not susceptible to damage during installation or failure during the gravel packing operation, is cost effective to manufacture and does not require difficult or time consuming on site assembly. In addition, the screen assembly of the present invention allows for a relatively large effective screen area for filtering out particulate from the production fluids. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The sand control screen assembly of the present invention comprises a base pipe that has one or more perforated sections and one or more nonperforated sections. A plurality of ribs are circumferentially spaced around and axially extending along the exterior surface of the base pipe. Two of the ribs are positioned within each of the nonperforated sections of the base pipe. A screen wire is wrapped around the plurality of ribs forming a plurality of turns having gaps therebetween. A filler material is disposed within the portions of the gaps that are circumferentially aligned with the nonperforated sections of the base pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The screen assembly includes one or more slurry passageways each of which are defined by one of the nonperforated section of the base pipe, the two ribs positioned within that nonperforated section of the base pipe and the portion of the wire and the filler material in the gaps that are circumferentially aligned with that nonperforated section of the base pipe. The slurry passageways are used to carry a fluid slurry containing gravel past any sand bridges that may form in the annulus surrounding the screen assembly. The fluid slurry is discharged from the screen assembly via a plurality of manifolds that are in fluid communication with the slurry passageways. The manifolds selectively discharge the fluid slurry to a plurality of levels of the interval through exit ports formed therein when the screen assembly is in an operable position. The exit ports may be either circumferentially aligned with the slurry passageways, circumferentially misaligned with the slurry passageways or both. The fluid communication between the manifolds and the slurry passageways may be established using tubes that extend from the manifolds into each adjacent sections of the slurry passageways. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the present invention wherein the screen assembly includes more than one section of sand control screen, each including a portion of the slurry passageway, the screen assembly includes a manifold between each of the sand control screen sections. These manifolds provide fluid communication between the portions of the slurry passageways of the adjacent sand control screen sections and deliver the fluid slurry into the interval surrounding the screen assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the present invention, the exit ports are created directly through the wire and the filler material in the gaps that are circumferentially aligned with the nonperforated sections of the base pipe instead of in manifolds. In this embodiment, tube segments may be disposed within the slurry passageways at the locations where the exit ports are created to provide support to the screen wire at these locations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The method of the present invention includes traversing a formation with the wellbore, positioning a sand control screen assembly having one or more slurry passageways as described above, within the wellbore, injecting a fluid slurry containing gravel through the slurry passageways such that the fluid slurry exits the screen assembly through exit ports in manifolds or through the screen wire at a plurality of levels of the interval and terminating the injecting when the interval is substantially completely packed with the gravel. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> While the making and using of various embodiments of the present invention are discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many applicable inventive concepts which can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the invention, and do not delimit the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Referring initially to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> sand control screen assembly for gravel packing an interval of a wellbore operating from an offshore oil and gas platform are schematically illustrated and generally designated <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A semi-submersible platform <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is centered over a submerged oil and gas formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> located below sea floor <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. A subsea conduit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> extends from deck <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of platform <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to wellhead installation <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> including blowout preventers <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Platform <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> has a hoisting apparatus <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and a derrick <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> for raising and lowering pipe strings such as work string <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A wellbore <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> extends through the various earth strata including formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A casing <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is cemented within wellbore <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> by cement <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. Work string <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> includes various tools for completing the well. On the lower end of work string <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is a sand control screen assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> for gravel packing an interval of wellbore <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> made up of a plurality of sections of sand control screens <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, three of which are depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>. Sand control screen assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is positioned adjacent to formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> between packers <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> in annular region or interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> including perforations <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>. When it is desired to gravel pack annular interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, a fluid slurry including a liquid carrier and a particulate material such as gravel is pumped down work string <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> As explained in more detail below, the fluid slurry will generally be injected into annular interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> between screen assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and wellbore <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in a known manner such as through a cross-over tool (not pictured) which allows the slurry to travel from the interior of work string <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the exterior of work string <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Once the fluid slurry is in annular interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, a portion of the gravel in the fluid slurry is deposited in annular interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Some of the liquid carrier may enter formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through perforation <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> while the remainder of the fluid carrier entering sand control screen assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. More specifically, sand control screen assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> disallows further migration of the gravel in the fluid slurry but allows the liquid carrier to travel therethrough and up to the surface in a known manner, such as through a wash pipe and into the annulus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> above packer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> If a sand bridge forms during the injection of the fluid slurry into annular region <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the fluid slurry will be diverted into one or more slurry passageways in sand control screen assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> to bypass this sand bridge. In this case, the fluid slurry will be discharged from sand control screen assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> through exit port at various levels within interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Again, once in annular interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the gravel in the fluid slurry is deposited therein. Some of the liquid carrier may enter formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> through perforation <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> while the remainder of the fluid carrier enters sand control screen assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, as described above, and returns to the surface. The operator continues to pump the fluid slurry down work string <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into annular interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and through the slurry passageways of sand control screen assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, as necessary, until annular interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> surrounding sand control screen assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is filled with gravel, thereby achieving a complete pack of interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, it should be noted by those skilled in the art, that the fluid slurry may be injected entirely into the slurry passageways of sand control screen assembly <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> without first injecting the fluid slurry directly into annular interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Even though <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a vertical well, it should be noted by one skilled in the art that the screen assembly for gravel packing an interval of a wellbore of the present invention is equally well-suited for use in deviated wells, inclined wells or horizontal wells. In addition, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the use of directional terms such as above, below, upper, lower, upward, downward and the like are used in relation to the illustrative embodiments as they are depicted in the figures, the upward direction being toward the top of the corresponding figure and the downward direction being toward the bottom of the corresponding figure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Also, even though <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts an offshore operation, it should be noted by one skilled in the art that the screen assembly for gravel packing an interval of a wellbore of the present invention is equally well-suited for use in onshore operations. Further, even though <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> has been described with regard to a gravel packing operation, it should be noted by one skilled in the art that the screen assembly of the present invention is equally well-suited for fracture operations and frac pack operations wherein a fluid slurry containing propping agents is delivered at a high flow rate and at a pressure above the fracture pressure of formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> such that fractures may be formed within formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and held open by the propping agents and such that annular interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is packed with the propping agents or other suitable particulate materials to prevent the production of fines from formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, therein is depicted a partial cut away view of a sand control screen assembly for gravel packing an interval of a wellbore of the present invention that is generally designated <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has a base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that has a plurality of perforated sections and a plurality of nonperforated sections. In the illustrated embodiment and as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> has three perforated sections <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> each of which include a plurality of openings <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. The exact number, size and shape of openings <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are not critical to the present invention, so long as sufficient area is provided for fluid production and the integrity of base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is maintained. Screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> also has three nonperforated sections <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> which are positioned at approximately 120 degree intervals from one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Circumferentially distributed around and axially extending along the outer surface of base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is a plurality of ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In the illustrated embodiment, ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are generally symmetrically distributed about the axis of base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Preferably, ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> have a generally triangular cross section wherein the base portion of ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> that contacts base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> has an arcuate shape that substantially matches the curvature of base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the base portion of ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may be shaped such that ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> contact base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> only proximate the apexes of the base portion of ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. In either case, once screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is fully assembled, the base portion of ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> should securely contact base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and provide the necessary fluid seal at the locations where the base portion of ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> contact base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Importantly, two of the ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are positioned against each of the nonperforated sections <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. Specifically, ribs <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, ribs <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and ribs <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are respectively positioned against nonperforated sections <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> Even though ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> have been described as having a generally triangular cross section, it should be understood by one skilled in the art that ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> may alternatively have other cross sectional geometries including, but not limited to, rectangular and circular cross sections so long as a proper seal between the ribs and the base pipe is established. Additionally, it should be understood by one skilled in the art that the exact number of ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> will be dependent upon factors such as the diameter of base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, the width of nonperforated sections <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, as well as other design characteristics that are well known in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Wrapped around and welded to ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is a screen wire <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Screen wire <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> forms a plurality of turns, such as turn <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, turn <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and turn <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Between each of the turns is a void or gap through which formation fluids flow such as gap <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> between turns <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and gap <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> between turns <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The number of turns and the gap between the turns are determined based upon factors such as the characteristics of the formation from which fluid is being produced and the size of the gravel to be used during the gravel packing operation. As illustrated, the gaps in the sections of screen wire <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> that are circumferentially aligned with nonperforated sections <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are sealed with a filler material <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> such as an epoxy resin. Filler material <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is selectively placed in the gaps between the turns of screen wire <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> such that fluid sealed slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are created between respective nonperforated sections <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and sealed sections <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of screen wire <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Together, ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and screen wire <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may form a sand control screen jacket that is attached to base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> by welding or other suitable technique forming each screen section of screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, screen wire <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> may be wrapped around and welded to ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in place against base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. It should be noted by those skilled in the art that even though <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> has depicted a wire wrapped screen, other types of filter media could alternatively be placed over ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> without departing from the principles of the present invention including, but not limited to, a fluid-porous, particulate restricting, sintered metal material such as a plurality of layers of a wire mesh that are sintered together to form a porous sintered wire mesh screen that is seam welded or spiral welded over ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Positioned at selected intervals, such as every five to ten feet, along each screen section of sand control screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is a manifold <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. Manifold <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is in fluid communication with slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> via tubes <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> which extend partially into slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>. In the illustrated embodiment, tubes <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> are welded within slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. Tubes <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> deliver the fluid slurry carried in slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> into manifold <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>. A portion of the fluid slurry in manifold <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> will enter the annular interval surrounding screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> via exit ports <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The remainder of the fluid slurry passes through annular area <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> of manifold <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and enters the next section of slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>. This process continues through the various levels of screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> along the entire length of the interval to be gravel packed such that a complete gravel pack of the interval can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In the illustrated embodiment, exit ports <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> of manifold <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are not circumferentially aligned with slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. This configuration helps to minimize liquid leak off after the area adjacent to a particular manifold has been packed with the gravel. Specifically, even after an area surrounding one of the manifolds has been packed with the gravel, it has been found that liquid from the fluid slurry may nonetheless leak off into this porous region causing not only a reduction in the velocity of the fluid slurry in slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, but also, an increase in the effective density of particles in the fluid slurry, each of which is a hindrance to particle transport to locations further along screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Positioning exit ports <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> out of phase with slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> reduces the liquid leak off by increasing the pressure required to push the liquid through the porous matrix and reduces the velocity of the liquid near exit ports <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, thereby reducing the rate of liquid leak off. This rate of liquid leak off is further reduced by using a liquid in the fluid slurry that is thixotropic such that its viscosity increases with reduced velocity through the porous matrix. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Even though <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> has depicted exit ports <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> as being circular, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that exit ports <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> could alternatively have other shapes without departing from the principles of the present invention, those shapes being considered within the scope of the present invention. Also, it should be noted by those skilled in the art that even though FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> have depicted three slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> at 120 degree intervals around screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, other numbers of slurry passageways, either greater or fewer, and other intervals between such slurry passageways may be used without departing from the principles of the present invention and are considered within the scope of the present invention. Likewise, even though <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</cross-reference> have depicted three exit ports <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> at 120 degree intervals around manifold <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, other numbers of exit port, either greater or fewer, and other intervals between such exit ports may be used without departing from the principles of the present invention and are considered within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>, therein is depicted a screen assembly for gravel packing an interval of a wellbore at the point where two sand control screens are joined together, that is generally designated <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>. As illustrated, screen assembly <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes sand control screen <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and sand control screen <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> each of which have the substantially identical construction as that described above with reference with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>. Screens <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are coupled together in a known manner such as via a threaded coupling (not pictured). Between screens <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, screen assembly <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> includes a tube and manifold system <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>. Tube and manifold system <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> includes three tubes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, only two of which are pictured, that deliver the fluid slurry from slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of screen <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to manifold <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. A portion of the fluid slurry in manifold <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> will enter the annular interval surrounding screen assembly <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> via three exit ports <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, only one of which is shown. The remainder of the fluid slurry enters three tubes <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, only two of which are pictured, and is delivered to slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of screen <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Even though <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference> depicts tubes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> that deliver the fluid slurry to manifold <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> as being circumferentially aligned with tubes <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> that transport the fluid slurry from manifold <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>, it is likely that tubes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> will not be circumferentially aligned as the adjoining sections of tube and manifold system <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> are threadably coupled when screen sections <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> of screen assembly <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> are threaded together. Accordingly, it is likely that tubes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and tubes <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> on opposite sides of manifold <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> will not be circumferentially aligned with one another. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> As should be apparent to those skilled in the art, even when tubes <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> and tubes <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> are positioned with a circumferential phase shift relative to one another, this does not affect the operation of the present invention as manifold <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> has a substantially annular region, such as annular region <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, through which the fluid slurry travels allowing for such misalignment. As such, the mating of adjoining sections of the screen assembly for gravel packing an interval of a wellbore of the present invention is substantially similar to mating typical joints of pipe to form a pipe string requiring no special coupling tools or techniques. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</cross-reference>, therein is depicted another embodiment of a screen assembly for gravel packing an interval of a wellbore that is generally designated <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight>. Screen assembly <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> includes a base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> that has three perforated sections <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> having openings <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> and three nonperforated sections <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Circumferentially distributed around and axially extending along the outer surface of base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is a plurality of ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> having a generally triangular cross section. Importantly, two of the ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> are positioned against each of the nonperforated sections <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Specifically, ribs <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, ribs <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and ribs <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> are respectively positioned against nonperforated sections <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>. Wrapped around and welded to ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is a screen wire <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. Screen wire <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> forms a plurality of turns, such as turn <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, turn <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and turn <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. Between each of the turns is a gap through which formation fluids flow such as gap <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> between turns <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> and gap <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> between turns <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. The gaps in the sections of screen wire <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> that are circumferentially aligned with nonperforated sections <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of base pipe <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> are sealed with a filler material <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. Filler material <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is selectively placed in the gaps between the turns of screen wire <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> such that fluid sealed slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are created between respective nonperforated sections <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, ribs <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and sealed sections <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of screen wire <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Positioned at selected intervals, such as every five to ten feet, along each screen section of sand control screen assembly <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> and within slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> are tube segments <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>. In the illustrated embodiment, tube segments <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> are welded within slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. Tube segments <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, which may be several inches to a foot long, are used to support screen wire <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> such that exit ports <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> may be drilled therethrough. A portion of the fluid slurry traveling through tube segments <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> will enter the annular interval surrounding screen assembly <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> via exit ports <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>. The remainder of the fluid slurry passes through tube segments <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> and enters the next section of slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. This process continues through the various levels of screen assembly <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> along the entire length of the interval to be gravel packed such that a complete gravel pack of the interval can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9, a</cross-reference> typical completion process using screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> for gravel packing an interval of a wellbore of the present invention will be described. First, screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> is positioned within wellbore <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> proximate formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> adjacent to formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is isolated. Packer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> seals the upper end of annular interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and packer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> seals the lower end of annular interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Cross-over assembly <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is located adjacent to screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, traversing packer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> with portions of cross-over assembly <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> on either side of packer <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. When the gravel packing operation commences, the objective is to uniformly and completely fill interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> with gravel. To help achieve this result, wash pipe <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is disposed within screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Wash pipe <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> extends into cross-over assembly <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> such that return fluid passing through screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, may travel through wash pipe <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, as indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, and into annulus <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, as indicted by arrow <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, for return to the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> The fluid slurry containing gravel is pumped down work string <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> into cross-over assembly <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> along the path indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. The fluid slurry containing gravel exits cross-over assembly <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> through cross-over ports <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> and is discharged into annular interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> as indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight>. This is the primary path as the fluid slurry seeks the path of least resistance. Under ideal conditions, the fluid slurry travels throughout the entire interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> until interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> is completely packed with gravel. If, however, a sand bridge forms in annular interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> before the gravel packing operation is complete, the fluid slurry containing gravel will enter slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> of screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to bypass the sand bridge as indicated by arrow <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>. The fluid slurry then travels within slurry passageways <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> with some of the fluid slurry exiting screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> at each of the manifolds <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> through exit ports <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, as indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> As the fluid slurry containing gravel enters annular interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>, the gravel drops out of the slurry and builds up from formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, filling perforations <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and annular interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> around screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> forming the gravel pack. Some of the carrier fluid in the slurry may leak off through perforations <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> into formation <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> while the remainder of the carrier fluid passes through screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, that is sized to prevent gravel from flowing therethrough. The fluid flowing back through screen assembly <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, as explained above, follows the paths indicated by arrows <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> back to the surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> In operation, the screen assembly for gravel packing an interval of a wellbore of the present invention is used to distribute the fluid slurry to various locations within the interval to be gravel packed by injecting the fluid slurry into the slurry passageways of the screen assembly when sand bridge formation occurs. The fluid slurry exits through the various exit ports in the manifolds along the length of the screen assembly into the annulus between the screen assembly and the wellbore which may be cased or uncased. Once in this annulus, a portion of the gravel in the fluid slurry is deposited around the screen assembly in the annulus such that the gravel migrates both circumferentially and axially from the exit ports. This process progresses along the entire length of the screen assembly such that the annular area becomes completely packed with the gravel. Once the annulus is completely packed with gravel, the gravel pack operation may cease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, it should be noted by those skilled in the art that instead of first injecting the fluid slurry directly into annular interval <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> until a sand bridge forms, the fluid slurry may initially be injected directly into the slurry passageways of the screen assembly for gravel packing an interval of a wellbore of the present invention. In either embodiment, once the gravel pack is completed and the well is brought on line, formation fluids that are produced into the gravel packed interval must travel through the gravel pack in the annulus prior to entering the sand control screen assembly. As such, the screen assembly for gravel packing an interval of a wellbore of the present invention allows for a complete gravel pack of an interval so that particulate materials in the formation fluid are filtered out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> While this invention has been described with reference to illustrative embodiments, this description is not intended to be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications and combinations of the illustrative embodiments as well as other embodiments of the invention, will be apparent to persons skilled in the art upon reference to the description. It is, therefore, intended that the appended claims encompass any such modifications or embodiments. </paragraph>
