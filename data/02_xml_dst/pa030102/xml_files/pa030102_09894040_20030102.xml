<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to agricultural harvesters and, more specifically, to header height control for such harvesters. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> A self-propelled harvester such as a combine usually includes a header for engaging a number of transversely spaced rows or a substantial width of crop. To maintain the header at the desired level above the ground or below the crop heads for efficient harvesting and for header grounding avoidance, an automatic header height control system is provided which typically includes a mechanical feeler or an acoustic sensor or similar non-contact ground sensing device mounted on the header. Examples of previously available devices are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,173,614; 5,704,200; 5,463,854; 5,155,984 and 4,171,606. U.S. Pat. No. 4,776,153 shows a header height control system with a plurality of feelers and a tilt control. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Although available control systems generally provide good position control in most situations and relieve the operator of the tedious job of manually adjusting height or tilt with changing ground and crop conditions, several problems exist with the systems. Hydraulic power requirements and material stress levels often are high when the lift systems are providing a fast response. The systems often fail to respond in time to avoid inefficient crop pickup, excessive crop material intake, or grounding and damage of the header. System response time is a problem when the harvester is travelling at relatively high speeds, such as when operating in field conditions wherein crop yield is low, and when the harvester is operating in fields having substantial ground contour changes. Tilt response time at high speeds or in fields with very uneven surface contours is often too slow for headers having automatic tilting systems to maintain the header generally parallel to the ground such as shown in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 4,776,153. Header grounding and damage, and improper header operating height, result in decreased productivity. When the harvester is crossing depressions such as valleys, gullies or swales, the header can be grounded and damaged before the lift system can respond to the sudden rise in the ground surface. Grounding is a particular problem when the front harvester wheels are in a depression and the header is adjacent a raised surface area. Near the apex of a hill or mounded area, the header is often too high and misses crop since the system cannot respond quickly to the abrupt change in ground surface. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved header position control system for a combine or other harvester. It is a further object to provide such a control system which overcomes most or all of the aforementioned problems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the invention to provide a header position control system having smoother response with reduced hydraulic power requirements and less material stress, particularly during high speed operations in fields with abruptly changing ground contours, than at least most previously available systems. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is a further object to provide a header position control system for a harvester which reduces or eliminates the incidences of header over- or under-height when depressions or rises in the ground surface are encountered. It is still another object of the invention to provide a header position control system which predicts and compensates for the ground irregularities encountered by the ground wheel support structure and the header. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> It is another object to provide an improved harvester height control system wherein desired header height and/or tilt position for a forward location is calculated in advance of the header and any ground sensing transducer on the header arriving at the location. It is still another object to provide such a system which is complementary to any conventional sensing transducer on the header and which can provide a predictive contour history over the entire width of the header. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> It is yet a further object to provide an improved harvester position control system for maintaining cut height within a preselected range of the crop heads to reduce non-crop material throughput and increase productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The system for improved header postition control includes a sensor, such as a crop edge detector, mounted on the harvester for measuring ground contour of an area a substantial distance in front of the header and providing a surface profile indication over the whole platform width. The sensor includes a transmitter mounted on the harvester for radiating a signal across an area approximately equal to the width of the path to be traversed by the header, and a receiver which receives reflected signals. Travel times of the signals from a radiated area in the path are utilized to estimate ground contour of that area. The ground contour can be estimated directly by scanning the area with a crop penetrating signal, such as a high frequency radar signal, and receiving reflections from the ground. By scanning with a laser device such as a rotatable crop edge sensor, signals are reflected from the crop and provide a crop contour signal. The crop contour signal can be used to maintain the header a preselected distance below the crop heads to reduce throughput and increase harvester productivity. The crop contour signal can also be used to estimate ground surface profile. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> An on-board processor calculates the desired header height and/or tilt for an area in advance of the harvester reaching the area. The early ground contour/crop contour measurements enable the height control and tilt control, if the combine is so equipped, to begin to make corrections in advance of the header reaching the area for smoother adjustments with less stress on harvester components. Hydraulic power requirements and header reaction response time are reduced, features which are particularly important when the harvester is operated at relatively high speeds or in fields with abruptly changing ground surface contours. The contour prediction may also used to compensate for effects of header attitude changes resulting from harvester ground wheels or tracks riding on that contour. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to one skilled in the art upon reading the following detailed description in view of the drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, therein is shown an agricultural harvester or combine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprising a main frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having wheel structure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> including front and rear ground engaging wheels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> supporting the main frame for forward movement over a field of crop to be harvested. Although wheels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> are shown, the wheel structure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> could include or be composed of ground engaging tracks. Drive to the front wheels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> is provided through a conventional hydrostatic transmission by an engine mounted on the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> A vertically adjustable header or harvesting platform <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is used for harvesting a crop and directing it to a feederhouse <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The feederhouse <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is pivotally connected to the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and includes a conveyor for conveying the harvested crop to a beater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The beater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> directs the crop upwardly through an inlet transition section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to a rotary threshing and separating assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Other orientations and types of threshing structures and other types of headers <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, such as transverse frame supporting individual row units, could also be utilized. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The rotary threshing and separating assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> threshes and separates the harvested crop material. Grain and chaff fall through grates on the bottom of the assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to a cleaning system <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. The cleaning system <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> removes the chaff and directs the clean grain to a clean grain elevator (not shown). The clean grain elevator deposits the clean grain in grain tank <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The clean grain in the tank can be unloaded into a grain cart or truck by unloading auger <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Threshed and separated straw is discharged from the axial crop processing unit through outlet <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to discharge beater <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. The discharge beater in turn propels the straw out the rear of the combine. It should be noted that the discharge beater <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> could also discharge crop material other than grain directly to a straw chopper. The operation of the combine is controlled from an operator&apos;s cab <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The rotary threshing and separating assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> comprises a cylindrical rotor housing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> and a rotor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> located inside the housing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight>. The front part of the rotor and the rotor housing define the infeed section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. Downstream from the infeed section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are the threshing section <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>, the separating section <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the discharge section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. The rotor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> in the infeed section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is provided with a conical rotor drum having helical infeed elements for engaging harvested crop material received from the beater <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and inlet transition section <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Immediately downstream from the infeed section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is the threshing section <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight>. In the threshing section <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> the rotor <highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> comprises a cylindrical rotor drum having a number of threshing elements for threshing the harvested crop material received from the infeed section <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Downstream from the threshing section <highlight><bold>39</bold></highlight> is the separating section <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> wherein the grain trapped in the threshed crop material is released and falls through a floor grate in the rotor housing <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> to the cleaning system <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>. The separating section merges into a discharge section <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> where crop material other than grain is expelled from the rotary threshing and separating assembly <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. Although the harvester <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is shown as a combine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for harvesting grain, it is to be understood that the present invention may also be utilized with other types of harvesters having vertically controlled headers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> The height of the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is controlled by a hydraulic lift system indicated generally at <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, and a header tilt system indicated generally at <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> may also be provided to maintain the header generally parallel to the surface of the ground. Feelers <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> or other conventional height sensing devices such as acoustic sensors supported from transversely spaced locations on the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> provide an indication of header height. A feederhouse transducer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> provides an indication of the angle of the feederhouse <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> relative to the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. The signals from the devices <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> are connected via lines <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>(<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) to a controller <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> which includes electrohydraulic valve structure <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> to control hydraulic fluid flow to and from one or two lift cylinders <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> connected between the feederhouse <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the frame <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> to operate the lift system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> to maintain the header within a desirable operating height range. The valve structure <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> also controls extension and retraction of a tilt cylinder <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to rotate the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> about a fore-and-aft extending axis for operation parallel to the ground surface. When the signal from one or more sensors <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on one side of the axis provides a raise indication while the signal from the opposite side provides a lower indication, the system will operate the cylinder <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to tilt the header about the axis for the proper attitude correction. When sensors on both sides of the axis provide a raise or a lower indication, the cylinder <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> will be extended or retracted accordingly for the necessary height correction to maintain the header in a preselected range of operating heights. Such a height control system is shown and described in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 4,776,153. The reaction times of the lift system <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> and the tilt system <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, however, are often too slow to compensate for abrupt changes in the ground surface contour, particularly when the harvester <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating at relatively high speeds. The reaction time may also be too slow to compensate for sudden header position changes relative to the ground that result from one or more of the wheels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of the wheel structure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> encountering a depression or raised area in the ground contour. The ability to cut a crop a preselected distance below the crop heads to limit throughput is also limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> An improved header height control includes a ground or crop contour predictive system indicated generally at <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. The system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is mounted on the combine <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to provide ground contour information generally over the entire width of the path P of the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a transceiver <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> located at a central location on the cab <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight> for transmitting and receiving signals <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight>. The transceiver radiates signals <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>t </italic></highlight>downwardly at an acute angle to the plane of the forward direction of the harvester <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> towards an area of ground <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> forwardly of the harvester <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The signals <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>t </italic></highlight>are preferably scanned or radiated across the entire width W of the path P of the header a distance on the order of 10 to 20 meters forwardly of the cab <highlight><bold>35</bold></highlight>. Reflected signals <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>r </italic></highlight>are received by the transceiver <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>. The time interval between transmission of a signal <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>t </italic></highlight>and the receipt of the signal <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>r </italic></highlight>provides an indication of the distance between the transceiver <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and the reflecting portion <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> of the ground surface or crop surface. In turn, the indication of distance provides ground contour information. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> As best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, the distance D increases with a drop in the surface contour (D<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>) and decreases with a rise in the contour (D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>). Therefore, if an increasing distance D is detected across an area <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can initiate a lowering of the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> prior to the header and height sensing device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> reaching the area. If the distance D decreases across the area, indicating a rise in the ground surface will soon be encountered by the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the controller <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> can initiate header lifting. The system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> is preferably utilized to complement the operation of the height sensing device <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and initiate early reaction of the height control to rapidly changing ground contours for reduced reaction time and decreased lift power requirements. However, the system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can also be used for primary control of header height if desired. For example, when controlling header position so crop cutting is maintained within a preselected range of distances below the crop heads, grounding is not a problem and primary control is by the system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> The system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> can also be utilized to complement the operation of the tilt system <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> to predict necessary header angle changes to avoid situations wherein the header is substantially offset from a parallel relationship with the ground. If the one side of the ground surface is rising relative to the opposite side for an area, advance information of the particular tilt necessary for that area can be provided for a timely tilt system response even at relatively high ground speeds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> The area scanned by the signals <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> includes areas <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> generally lying in the path of the harvester wheel structure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> so that, if desired, the contour of the ground supporting the wheels <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> can be taken into consideration when the system is predicting the desired height control response for the area <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. The system <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> includes a processor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> for calculating distances D based on signal travel time and converting the distances to ground contour information. The contour information for each area <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> is stored in memory to provide a ground contour history generally over a length of the path P extending from the present area <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> receiving impinging signals <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>t </italic></highlight>rearwardly a distance at least equal to the distance between the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the rear wheels <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>. Therefore, the effect on header position due to changing ground contour under the wheel support structure <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> can be factored into the desired height control response for any given area <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight>. The processor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> can calculate the expected height response for a given area <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> on a time based history of the contour areas or on a distance based history. For a distance based history, harvester speed information is input to the processor via line <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the transceiver <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> transmits a signal <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>t </italic></highlight>that can penetrate standing crop to reach the ground, such as a high frequency radar beam. In another embodiment, a laser ranging device, such as a SICK model LMS 200 series laser measurement system, or a crop edge sensor (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>) mounted on a turntable <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, can be used for determining a crop surface contour which generally approximates the underlying ground surface contour. The crop edge sensor of FIG. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> has a limited scan angle of approximately <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> degrees for determining crop edge and providing a guidance control signal on line <highlight><bold>99</bold></highlight>. The turntable <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> rotates the sensor about an upright axis to permit a full platform width scan, which is on the order of 90 degrees, to be accomplished in several steps during time periods between guidance control signals. The frequency of the scans is preferably dependent on deviations of crop edge from a straight path with more scans being facilitated when the crop edge is straight and fewer guidance corrections are required. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6, a</cross-reference> typical full platform width scan signal for the laser crop edge sensor <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> is represented by the solid line at <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. Distance, determined by the time for the signals <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>t </italic></highlight>to travel to the area <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight> and the corresponding reflected signals <highlight><bold>77</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>r </italic></highlight>to be received at the transceiver <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight>, is plotted against scan angle for a typical scan of approximately 90 degrees. The portion <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>represents the signals reflected from the ground in area <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> outside the crop edge (CE). At the crop edge CE there will be a sudden decease in the detected distance, represented by the segment <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, as the signal <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>t </italic></highlight>is reflected from the top of the crop at the crop edge rather than the ground. The distance d<highlight><subscript>t </subscript></highlight>to the top of the crop across the width of the path W is represented by the segment <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>t</italic></highlight>. Theoretical ground contour (GC) therefore can be estimated by adding the distance change at the crop edge, represented by the length of the segment <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d</italic></highlight>, to each distance measurement on the segment <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The theoretical ground contour GC is provided as an input to the height control system. If a transmitter with a crop-penetrating signal is utilized, the actual ground contour is detected and the distance d<highlight><subscript>t </subscript></highlight>will correspond to the line GC in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>. If the position of the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is to be controlled to cut crop a preselected distance below crop heads, the crop surface contour prediction is used by the controller <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7, 8</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> illustrate ground contour prediction to initiate reaction of the tilt system <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight> in a timely manner to maintain generally parallel relationship between the header and the surface of the ground. As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the scan signal <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> shows a decreasing distance from the crop edge CE (the distance measured on the left side of the scan, D<highlight><subscript>L</subscript></highlight>, is greater than the distance D<highlight><subscript>R </subscript></highlight>measured on the right side of the scan) to the opposite side of the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> which, in turn, indicates that the approaching area has a downward slope towards the crop edge CE (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). The processor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>) calculates header tilt necessary for the radiated area and signals the electrohydraulic controller <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> to initiate actuation of the tilt cylinder <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to assure the header will have the proper tilt angle by the time the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> reaches the area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> The angle of transmission of the signals <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>t </italic></highlight>relative to the horizontal can be changed to increase or decrease the distance D (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) between the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and the ground area being radiated as the ground speed of the harvester <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> increases or decreases. The angle is selected to provide sufficient lead time for the lift and tilt control systems to react to rapidly changing surface contours. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> By way of example only, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</cross-reference> illustrate a calculation method model to estimate expected distance (D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>) in an x-y coordinate system wherein four points P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are on a circle M of large radius R so that the calculation can be linearized. Sensor position is (X<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>, Z<highlight><subscript>5</subscript></highlight>), and a<highlight><subscript>5 </subscript></highlight>is the inclination angle of the sensor. Feederhouse angle is zero when the header is on the ground. P<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is the point on the contour in the area being radiated. P<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is a point on the header, and P<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and P<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> are wheel contact points. Other conventional calculation methods can be used for ground and crop contour predictions based on signal travel time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, after the predictive height control is initiated at <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight>, the processor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> determines distance D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> based on signal travel time at <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. At <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>, present feederhouse angle based on the signal from the feederhouse transducer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and present header height is determined from the feederhouse signal and from signals from the height sensing devices <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>. The expected distance is calculated at <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> based on the feederhouse angle and header height at <highlight><bold>203</bold></highlight>. The measured distance D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> (at <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>) is compared with the expected distance (at <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>), and if the measured distance D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is smaller than the expected distance (<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>), indicating that the contour is rising, the processor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> signals the controller to lift the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (<highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>) with a time or distance based delay, if necessary, to coordinate the positioning of the header for the particular area in the path with the arrival of the header at that area. If the header height is within the desired range of heights (<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>) or after the lift is initiated at <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight>, the cycle is begun again as the processor returns to the step <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> A control loop shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> provides header lowering and small lifts of the header based on header height signals from the height sensing devices <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> on the header and on the feederhouse angle signal. Actual header height (HH) based on the signals from the devices <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and the transducer <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is compared at <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> with a desired header height range HH*. If the desired header height HH* is less than the measured HH, the processor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> signals the valve structure <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> to extend the cylinders <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> and raise the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. If header height is below the desired range of heights at <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, the cylinders <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> are retracted to lower the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Header height is maintained (<highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>) when the header height is in the desired range. In the predictive control loop of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference>, if the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is being lifted at <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> because of a predicted contour change in an area, the processor ignores signals from the header sensors <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> to lower the header in order to avoid sudden reversals of the lift system and to assure adequate system response time to avoid problems such as grounding or cutting of the crop too far below the crop heads in the area. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Predictive header lowering usually is not required for operations wherein header height is maintained within an operating range of heights relative to the ground surface because of the fast lowering rate caused by the weight of the header. However, when the harvester is operating in a cut-below-crop head mode, it is usually advantageous for the operation to be purely predictive. When operating in such a mode, the control loop of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is modified to include an additional decision block to provide a predictive lowering function at the &ldquo;no&rdquo; output branch of block <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight>. Before returning control to block <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>, the distance D<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is checked to see if it is larger than the expected distance, indicating the crop contour is dropping and a header lowering will be required to maintain crop cutting in the desired range of distances below the crop head. The processor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> signals the controller to lower the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> with a time delay to coordinate the header lowering with the arrival of the header at the measured area. Since header lowering is much faster than header raising, the time delay for initiating lowering is typically greater than the time delay for initiating raising. Control is then returned to <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> When the harvester <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is equipped with a tilt system <highlight><bold>61</bold></highlight>, control of the system is according to the flow chart shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference>. Upon initiation of the predictive tilt control at <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, the distances D<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>and D<highlight><subscript>R </subscript></highlight>to the left and right, respectively, of the centerline of the combine are measured at <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. The header tilt angle HT is measured at <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> by a conventional transducer (not shown) mounted on the feederhouse <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> between the feederhouse frame and a front plate which mounts the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. After HT is measured, the processor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> calculates the expected header tilt HT<highlight><subscript>exp </subscript></highlight>at <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> based on the value of HT found at <highlight><bold>303</bold></highlight> and calculates the expected distances DL<highlight><subscript>exp </subscript></highlight>and DR<highlight><subscript>exp</subscript></highlight>. If the measured tilt HT is not within a preselected range of angles relative to the expected tilt HT<highlight><subscript>exp </subscript></highlight>(<highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>), the distance D<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>is compared with the distance DL<highlight><subscript>exp </subscript></highlight>at <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>. If the distance D<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>is less than DL<highlight><subscript>exp</subscript></highlight>, which indicates the left side of the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> will need to be raised for the approaching area, the processor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> signals the electrohydraulic controller <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> to initiate actuation of the tilt cylinder <highlight><bold>69</bold></highlight> to lift the left side of the header (<highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight>). If the distance D<highlight><subscript>L </subscript></highlight>is greater than DL<highlight><subscript>exp</subscript></highlight>, which indicates the left side of the header <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is too high, the processor <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> signals the controller <highlight><bold>67</bold></highlight> to initiate tilt cylinder operation to lower the left side of the header (<highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>). If the measured HT is in the desired range (<highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>) or after the necessary tilt correction has been initiated (<highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>), the processor returns to the step <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the conventional tilt control using the transversely spaced header-mounted sensors <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> remains operational and is responsible for minor corrections to header tilt angle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> When the harvester <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is operating in standing crops and the system is set to cut crop a preselected range of distances below the crop heads, the system is preferably operated in the predictive mode without need for the conventional header-mounted sensors, and predictive header lowering is enabled in the control loop of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> as described above. Also, the delay between the contour prediction and the operation of the lift and tilt cylinders preferably is speed dependent (location based) for accuracy rather than dependant on time only. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Having described the preferred embodiment, it will become apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the accompanying claims. </paragraph>
