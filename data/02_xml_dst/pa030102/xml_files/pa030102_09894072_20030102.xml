<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to mounting and alignment techniques for free-space coupling optics, and applications thereof in optical amplifiers requiring free space coupling to or from fiber optic signal and pump sources. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The field of fiber optic communication continues to draw much attention, with optical transmission over fiber optic links offering much greater and reliable bandwidth than conventional lower frequency (i.e., RF) approaches. In addition to established &ldquo;long-haul&rdquo; fiber links, interest continues to grow in the rapid spread of fiber links into urban, &ldquo;metro&rdquo; areas currently constrained by the much lower bandwidths of twisted pair and coaxial cable, and in other parts of the world lacking any installed communication media. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Among many other technologies, optical amplification plays a key role in fiber optic transmission. Optical amplifiers enable optical transmission over longer distances in long-haul networks, and through the geographically and structurally diverse network &ldquo;terrain&rdquo; in densely populated metro areas. Before the advent of optical amplifiers, fiber links required expensive and cumbersome electrical regeneration at lossy points. Optical amplifiers eliminate this costly regeneration by amplifying the signal directly in the optical spectral regions (e.g., 1550 nm), without electrical regeneration. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In fact, optical amplifiers have enabled the recent introduction of dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) which involves independent and simultaneous transmission of different data streams (e.g., 10 GB/sec each) on different respective wavelengths across the band (e.g., the &ldquo;C&rdquo; band from about 1530-1562 nm). Electronic detectors used in regeneration are incapable of discriminating between different wavelengths, therefore, DWDM systems require an independent repeater for each wavelength in the system, as well as the necessary filtering components to isolate each of the wavelengths into their respective repeaters. DWDM systems with regeneration are thus prohibitively expensive. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The advent of optical amplification fundamentally changed the potential topologies of DWDM networks. Because the optical amplifier is capable of amplifying multiple wavelengths independently in a single unit, a DWDM system can use a single optical amplifier for all channels, thus eliminating regeneration entirely. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> System manufacturers are desirous of devices in increasingly smaller and more compact packages, while at the same time integrating multiple functions into a single device. In sharp contrast to the ever-shrinking size of many optical network components, the well-known erbium doped fiber amplifier (&ldquo;EDFA&rdquo;) faces certain limits because of the fixed value of the minimum bend radius of the fiber. Bend losses are proportional to the bend radius, and hence the radius must be kept large. A nominal radius for such fiber is about 3.75 cm, resulting in a coil diameter of about 7.5 cm (about 3 inches) which in turn results in an minimum package planar dimension of at least 3&frac12;&times;3&frac12; inches. Consequently, though many components such as the isolators, 980/1550 nm multiplexers, and monitor taps and photodiodes can be integrated into the package, the footprint remains constrained by the minimum diameter of the erbium-doped fiber coil. Nominal package dimensions are now about 6&times;6 inches. Moreover, EDFAs have certain commercial disadvantages, such as the high cost of the doped fiber and the single mode pump diodes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) are also available, and rely on electrical (rather than optical) pump sources for amplification. However, their performance characteristics are known to be deficient in many areas, compared to EDFAs. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> As systems continue to grow and expand into the &ldquo;metro&rdquo; domain, system designers find themselves in need of new devices, amplifiers in particular, that are smaller and less expensive than their current counterparts. A compact, low cost optical amplifier is therefore required. In the commonly-assigned, above-incorporated U.S. Patent Applications, a waveguide amplifier is disclosed which addresses some of these size and cost concerns. As shown in the opening figures herein (discussed in greater detail below) packaged amplifier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> includes an easily fabricated waveguide chip <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> with an on-board signal/pump multiplexer and gain medium. Signal input coupling optics <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and output coupling optics <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> are provided to focus the optical signal into and out of the waveguide chip from input fiber <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> and output fiber <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, respectively; and pump coupling optics <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are provided to focus the optical pump source into the chip. In one embodiment, the pump source is multimode, and the signal is single mode. Multi-mode pumps increase the absorption in the gain medium, and are available in greater quantities at cheaper prices than their single mode counterparts. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> The free space optical coupling approach allows greater flexibility in the choice of waveguide chip architecture, but also leads to alignment challenges. The optical signal and pump must be focused into the chip with an accuracy of a few microns, since the gain medium (i.e., the core <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>) has a cross section on the order of 10-15 mm on a side; a typical fiber optic core diameter (SMF-28) is on the order of 8 mm; and the laser diode (pump) aperture is on the order of 1&times;100 mm. Thus any mounting technique used to affix the various coupling optics into a package must be very accurate, and the mounts must maintain their position without significant movement during fabrication, and over the useful life of the amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> What is needed, therefore, are alignment and mounting techniques for coupling optics used to free-space couple optical signals to and from fiber optics and pump sources; with an emphasis on their use in waveguide amplifiers. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The shortcomings of the prior approaches are overcome, and additional advantages are provided, by the present invention which in one aspect is a mount apparatus, and methods for forming and using the same, for at least one coupling optic requiring alignment along an optical transmission axis. A flanged optical assembly tube is provided, within which the coupling optic is placed along an optical transmission axis thereof, the tube having a flange projecting outwardly from its surface. A mount for supporting the tube is provided, having a base section and an upright section perpendicular thereto. The upright section of the mount includes a vertical surface against which at least one surface of the flange of the tube is affixed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The flange projects outwardly from the surface of the tube at a 90 degree angle relative to the optical transmission axis of the tube, and the upright section of the mount includes a slot into which the tube is affixed. The flange has at least one outer edge surface coplanar with at least one outer edge surface of the mount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The flange and the upright section may be affixed with a series of laser welds along the junction of the coplanar outer edge surfaces; and the flange and the upright section may have equivalent widths such that both outer edge surfaces of each are respectively coplanar with a respective outer edge surface of the other, and the flange and the upright section are affixed with respective series of laser welds along each junction of the coplanar outer edge surfaces. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> The mount apparatus is especially useful in an optical component package requiring the coupling optic to be aligned along the transmission axis of the tube, in which case the mount apparatus is affixed in said package to effect said alignment. The mount apparatus may be affixed in the package with a series of structural and corrective laser welds along at least one lower edge of the base section of the mount; and the flanged optical assembly may have at least one thinned portion with a series of corrective laser welds thereon. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The mount apparatus may have particular applicability in an optical amplifier package, having a channel waveguide chip including a gain medium for amplifying an input signal and producing an output signal, and a pump source, wherein the mount apparatus is affixed in the package such that the coupling optic therein facilitates coupling of at least one of the input signal, output signal, or pump, to or from the waveguide chip. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> The channel waveguide chip may include an amplifying core having an input end for receiving the input signal and the pump, and an output end for producing an amplified, output signal; and a region proximate said input end of said amplifying core in which the input optical signal and the optical pump signal are combined. In one embodiment, the region comprises a surface through which the pump is received, and wherein the pump and the input signal are together combined into the core at said surface. In this embodiment, the surface of the channel waveguide chip is arranged at an approximately 45 degree angle with the core thereof, the pump source transmits the pump at approximately a 90 degree angle with the core, and the channel waveguide chip may include a reflective coating applied over the surface to reflect and thereby combine the pump into the core with the input signal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The materials comprising the core and a cladding of the waveguide may be structurally and/or chemically distinct having been separately fabricated as physically different materials and brought together during waveguide assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In one amplifier embodiment, the input signal is single mode and the pump is multi-mode, and the only optical ports to or from the package are optical signal input and output ports, and the package has at least one planar dimension less than about three inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> The flanged optical assembly tubes and L-mounts, and their mounting and alignment techniques, are especially suited for this type of amplifier, though they are also applicable in other optical applications wherein the optics in an assembly tube require mounting in a package, and permanent alignment with other optical components along a common optical transmission axis. These techniques (the mutually perpendicular portions of the mount, and the flat mating surfaces) ensure proper alignment of the mount when affixed in a package.</paragraph>

These components may be aligned on alignment bench <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> using mounts <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight>, respectively (the details of which are discussed further below with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>).

<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> Briefly summarized, in one embodiment fabrication of optical waveguide <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is a multi-step process using precision lapping and polishing techniques to mechanically thin the selected optical material (i.e., core) to the desired thickness in both the lateral and vertical directions. Optical adhesives are used to bond the channel waveguide to the surrounding support/cladding media. The fabrication process may include preparing a flat, optical surface on both the chosen optical material (i.e., core) and the chosen support substrate (i.e., cladding). Fused silica may be used as a support substrate due to its ease of processing and low refractive index. In the case of very thin adhesive layers (&lt;1 &mgr;m), for efficient waveguiding action, the channel must be surrounded by a lower refractive index material. Obviously, the refractive index of the selected optical material (core) determines the index range for the cladding or support regions. Other requirements of the surrounding medium are processing compatibility with the optical material, availability of the material, and adhesive bonding affinity. Fused silica meets these requirements, although a range of optical glasses are also ideal. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> To effect the requisite optical gain, the waveguide chip <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> may be composed of a linear core <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> doped with active ions. The compact nature of the waveguide is enabled by the use of high-gain materials. Of particular applicability is the family of Erbium/Ytterbium (Er/Yb) co-doped phosphate glasses which have nearly 100 times the number density of atoms, do not suffer quenching effects, and have twice the emission cross-section relative to their silica counterparts typically used in EDFAs. The core <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight> may be nominally square in cross-section and of size from 10 mm to 30 mm on a side. The surrounding cladding <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> may be an undoped material of lower refractive index, effecting guiding of the now multiplexed input and pump signals. To multiplex the input and pump signals, the input end of the waveguide chip may be polished at an exemplary angle (&agr;) of 45 degrees with respect to the waveguide axis. The input, angle-polished end <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight> is then coated <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> to transmit the input optical signal into the core, but reflect the applied pump signal <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> into the core, and overlaid with a prism <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> matched in index to the core (and bonded to the waveguide with, e.g., an ultraviolet (UV)-cured optical adhesive) for directing the input optical signal colinearly into the core. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> The opposing end of the waveguide may be prepared in one of two ways. The first design (not shown) utilizes a perpendicular end-face with an anti-reflection (AR) coating to minimize back-reflections. If, however, the AR coating is insufficient, the second design option (shown) involves polishing end <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> at an angle, which is then anti-reflectively coated <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> and overlaid with a prism <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> matched in index to the core (and bonded to the waveguide with, e.g., an ultraviolet (UV)-cured optical adhesive) for directing the input optical signal colinearly from the core, for the purpose of further mitigating reflections. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> With reference to the exploded, packaged view of the amplifier of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, the channel waveguide chip in one embodiment is about 10-30 mm in length (L), and the overall planar dimensions of the amplifier package <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> (i.e., the length &ldquo;L&rdquo; and width &ldquo;W&rdquo;), can therefore be about 2&frac12;&times;1&frac12; inches. (The package thickness is about &frac34; inch.) This smaller, overall planar dimension stands in contrast to that of a functionally equivalent EDFA amplifier of 6&times;6 inches, at the 1530-1565 nm bandwidth of interest, and in fact is even better than the known, minimal planar dimensions of EDFAs discussed above of 3&times;3 inches, based on the minimum bend radius. The present invention therefore provides at least one (and in fact both) planar dimensions of less than about 3 inches. Waveguide chip <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of amplifier <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> provides high gain in a relatively short device (when compared to the several meters of erbium-doped fiber typical in EDFAs), and therefore results in a smaller size of the amplifier housings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Waveguide <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> requires a pump source to provide the optical pump signal waveguide gain. To couple the signal <highlight><bold>211</bold></highlight> from the pump laser diode into the waveguide <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, lenses in assembly tube <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> are used to focus the power into the waveguide off of the 45-degree coated end-face of the waveguide. The pump source may therefore be arranged to transmit the optical pump signal at an angle of 90 degrees relative to the longitudinal axis of the waveguide. Notably, the optical pump signal is generated internal to the amplifier housing, and no additional optical input ports are required for the pump signal. This feature adds to the cost and space savings provided by the amplifier disclosed herein. With reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>exemplary pump source <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> disclosed herein is a single or multi-mode laser diode on a submount and maintained at constant temperature with a thermo-electric cooler (TEC) <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>. Power is provided to both the laser diode and the TEC through external package pins <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). Additional pins may also be included to incorporate a monitor photodiode to monitor pump laser power, a thermistor to monitor pump laser temperature, and gain monitoring sensors (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Because free-space optical coupling is employed in this amplifier to focus the transmissions from the signal and pump sources into the narrow core of the waveguide chip, alignment and mounting techniques are necessary which allow precise alignment within the optical paths in the single or sub-micron ranges. These techniques must also prevent drift of those components out of alignment, either during the attachment process itself, or throughout the life of the product. In accordance with the present invention, improved mounts and mounting techniques are disclosed which provide greater alignment accuracy, and reliability, than those of the prior art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> With reference to the perspective views of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, the improved mounts and mounting techniques will be described. For the purposes of this discussion, the input <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight> and output <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> assembly tubes, and their mounts <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>, are assumed similar and are thus discussed with reference to the same figures. Any potential differences will be pointed out where needed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> The assembly tube <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> encloses optics necessary for the optical focusing into and out of the fibers and waveguide as discussed above, and comprises about 4 exemplary sections. (The term &ldquo;tube&rdquo; is used broadly herein to connote any type of structure, whether cylindrical or not, used to support optical component(s) facilitating transmission along the transmission axis thereof; similarly, the term &ldquo;coupling optic&rdquo; is also used broadly herein to connote any type of optical device used to facilitate transmission along an optical path, with or without imparting changes to the signal.) Section <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, with a relatively wide diameter, is designed to hold an asphere lens for the final focusing into/out of the waveguide. Section <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>, having a reduced diameter and thickness (discussed below), holds a portion of an isolator (optional in the output assembly). Section <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> terminates at perpendicular flange <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>. Preferably, as discussed below with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, sections <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> and flange <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> are machined from a single sample of stainless steel (e.g., 304L), since established machining techniques can ensure a perpendicular relationship to the requisite tolerances. Section <highlight><bold>430</bold></highlight> (preferably a separate section of the assembly tube flush mounted against flange <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight>) may also hold a portion of an optical isolator. Section <highlight><bold>440</bold></highlight> holds a collimating lens for interface to the input/output fibers (not shown for clarity). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> The mount <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is L-shaped and includes an upright section <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> and a perpendicular, base section <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight>, preferably machined from a common INVAR sample. A U-shaped slot <highlight><bold>127</bold></highlight> is machined into the upright section <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> to accommodate the assembly tube <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In accordance with the present invention, section <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> of mount <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is mounted to the underlying alignment bench <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, and tube <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> is mounted to the upright section <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> of the mount. In the preferred embodiment, mounting is effected using a series of laser welding points <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight>. Laser welding is preferable to other bonding techniques such as epoxy, because of its durability and long-term reliability. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> The unitary, machined nature of L-mount <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>; and that of flange <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> relative to sections <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of the assembly tube, ensures very precise perpendicularity and therefore linear alignment between the tube and waveguide core, along the optical transmission path. This alignment is improved by ensuring that the mating surfaces (designated together as junction <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight>) are machined to a &ldquo;16&rdquo; finish. This combination of smooth, vertical mating surfaces, machined to be precisely perpendicular to the tube axis and base respectively, ensures alignment of the optical axis with the waveguide core, especially along the X-Y axes shown. Moreover, the outer, vertical surfaces of the flange <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> and upright portion <highlight><bold>125</bold></highlight> are machined to ensure co-planar relationship by ensuring identical dimensions &ldquo;W,&rdquo; to thereby accommodate laser weld series <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> These components are initially welded onto bench <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> according to two &ldquo;structural&rdquo; welding phases as follows: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> During a first welding phase, opposing laser weld series <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are performed simultaneously in the front-to-back, 1-2-3 sequence shown, to mount the L-mount <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight> to the underlying optical bench <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>. This fixes motion of the mount in the Z axis direction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> During a second welding phase, the assembly tube is positioned with its flange against and aligned to the upright section <highlight><bold>121</bold></highlight> of the mount, and opposing weld series <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are performed simultaneously, in the respective 1-2-3 sequences shown, to affix the assembly tube to the mount along the outer, coplanar edge surfaces. The corners should therefore be &ldquo;sharp&rdquo; at these edges to ensure a smooth junction which better accommodates these welds. These &ldquo;edge&rdquo; welds are better than through &ldquo;lap&rdquo; welds, as they ensure better alignment. Notably, the sequence of the second and third welds is switched to offset any adverse impact of post-weld shifting along the X-Y axes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> These first two series of welds (<highlight><bold>441</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>442</bold></highlight>) are &ldquo;structural&rdquo; inasmuch as they affix the mount to the alignment bench, and then the assembly tube to the mount. During these structural welds, the mount and assembly tube are held in place with movable gripping tools, and can be initially aligned to the previously mounted waveguide core by high-precision visual or automated sensing apparatus. Preferably, however, an input optical signal source and output monitor are used to measure alignment along the optical path. A &ldquo;best case&rdquo; transmission spectra (i.e., gain) is obtained while the components are held in place accurately with external tooling, and this gain is ideally maintained as the welds are made and the tooling removed. However, due to post-weld shift phenomena, wherein material contraction occurs while the welds cool, mis-alignment may result. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> To correct for post-weld shift, at least two more &ldquo;corrective&rdquo; weld phases are employed subsequent to the first and second &ldquo;structural&rdquo; phases above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> During a third welding phase, corrective welds such as <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>443</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are made. These welds use the above-described phenomena of post-weld shift to re-align the areas which may have previously shifted. The placement of these welds is chosen to correctively re-shift the components opposite to the directions in which they moved during the structural weld phase. The location(s) of the welds are chosen based on the desired movement direction and distance, and knowing that welds at joints usually cause a pulling motion in the direction of the larger/fixed mass. In the configuration described here, an adjustment of 2-3 dB in optical signal gain can be expected during this corrective phase. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> During a fourth welding phase, corrective welds such as <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>1 </subscript></highlight>and <highlight><bold>444</bold></highlight><highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>are made, on the surface of a thinned portion (section <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight>) of the assembly tube itself. In accordance with the present invention and as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> (dimensions in inches), the walls of this section of the tube are adequately thinned to a thickness of about 15 mils, in section <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> of the tube. At this thickness (using a Unitek Miyachi LW51 laser welding system) the post-weld cooling process can be expected to contract local material, and therefore &ldquo;pull&rdquo; other adjacent portions of the tube toward the weld. This has the effect of bending or pivoting that portion of the tube in a desired direction, i.e., toward the waveguide core, so that the asphere lense mounted in section <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight> of assembly tube <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>/<highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is further aligned with the waveguide core. This can provide finer gain adjustments, in the range of 0.1 Db. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> With further reference to the cross-sectional view of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, the &ldquo;thinned&rdquo; section <highlight><bold>420</bold></highlight> is shown in greater detail. Dashed line <highlight><bold>460</bold></highlight> represents the outer diameter of the tube had this extra thinning process not been employed, and would have resulted in a 52 mil thickness in this section. This outer diameter would have corresponded to the outer diameter of section <highlight><bold>410</bold></highlight>, where the asphere lens is located, for machining ease. An extra machining step is therefore employed to provided the thinned section. (The inner diameters of the tube are determined as a function of the internal optics, omitted here for clarity.) </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0060" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0060&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>show views of the assembly tube <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> and L-mount <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> combination used to focus the pump signal into the waveguide. While the dimensions of this combination are somewhat different than the dimensions of the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>combination, the same general structural and process techniques discussed above apply, i.e., the use of an L-shaped mount, the flanged assembly tube designed to mate with the mount, and similar structural and corrective laser weld patterns. Also, only an asphere lens is provided in this assembly tube; as a fast axis collimating (FAC) can be placed on the diode assembly itself. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0061" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0061&rsqb;</number> The amplifier disclosed herein facilitates integration of additional components. An optional planar lightwave circuit (PLC) may be inserted into the optical path, for example, a silica waveguide splitter or an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) multiplexer. This device, because of its performance in a filter capacity, has potentially high insertion loss. However, when integrated with the compact, low-cost amplifier discussed above in a small package, the intrinsic losses are offset to create so-called &ldquo;lossless&rdquo; versions. Many benefits result from a small, inexpensive amplifier integrated with one, or even several, additional optoelectronic components, such as a PLC. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0062" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0062&rsqb;</number> Because the waveguide is coupled to fibers, other fiber coupling devices can be placed in the path to enhance performance. Improved coupling optics (input and/or output) include, for example, a thin-film gain-flattening filter. This filter can be obtained with a gain profile inverse to that of the amplifier itself. The filter results in a flat gain curve. Gain-flattening is desirable, especially between the operating bandwidth of about 1530-1560 nm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> An optical tap (e.g., 1% mirror) is also possible, having an output directed to a photodetector. These optional components could be used for monitoring the optical signal as it passes through the amplifier. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> These performance enhancing optical components could be placed in the input optics, output optics, or both, and these terms are used broadly herein to connote any hardware which can be fairly characterized as carrying signals to or from the waveguide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> In current implementations, the small signal gain of the amplifier is about 10 dB; the noise figure at 1550 nm, &minus;30 dBm is &lt;5 dB; the 5 dB gain bandwidth (without flattening) spans from about 1525 to 1560 nm; the maximum saturated output power is &gt;13 dBm; and the output power at the 3 dB gain compression (1550 nm) is &gt;10 dBm. Offering more than 10 dB of gain and saturated powers above 13 dBm, this amplifier is suitable for overcoming losses associated with couplers, WDMs, switches and other passive optical components necessary in optical networking systems. Its applications include metropolitan networks; lossless branching; testbeds; instrumentation; optical add-drop multiplexers; and optical switch arrays. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The amplifier discussed herein, based on a channel waveguide chip, provides compact, low cost optical solutions for use in fiber optic systems. Its primary application is optical amplification in communication systems where space is at a premium, and smaller devices are required. In addition, these amplifiers are ideal for use in systems where the design requires large numbers of low-cost devices to achieve the desired performance. Finally, because of their compact nature, the amplifiers can be integrated with other devices such as splitters or multiplexers and de-multiplexers. When adding additional components into the package, the insertion loss associated with the components can be offset by the optical amplification, allowing for the development of &ldquo;lossless&rdquo; versions of these very same optical components. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The flanged optical assembly tubes and L-mounts, and their mounting and alignment techniques, are especially suited for this type of amplifier, though they are also applicable in other optical applications wherein the optics in an assembly tube require mounting in a package, and permanent alignment with other optical components along a common optical transmission axis. These techniques (the mutually perpendicular portions of the mount, and the flat mating surfaces) ensure proper alignment of the mount when affixed in a package. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiment(s) thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. </paragraph>
